conclusion

the purpose of the lab was to find mathematical models that can describe the behavior of a system and to develop and understanding of found models.

in each of the labs trials where done involving the system on the track and data was taken in regards to the acceleration and the mass that was hanging from the system or was placed directly on the system. the trials in lab five resulted in a linear model of $y=0.0256 x - 7.576$ and a power model of                   $y = 7e^{07} x-3.185$ . these models were obtained from graphing the collected data during lab five. in the linear model y is acceleration and x is mass. the constant in the equation is the force of gravity. in the power model y is acceleration and x is mass. three models were found from the graphed data in lab six corresponding to the three different heights at which the track was set. the models were $y = 3.086 x - 0.1399$, $y = 3.1437 x - 0.2246$, and $y = 2.8 x - 0.0371$ each having y corresponding to acceleration and x corresponding to mass.

group six found that when the friction of the system is increased the acceleration of the system will decrease. thus the position of the graphs was lower when there was an increased friction supporting that the y value in the equations is acceleration and the x values are mass. 
group two had similar findings to group six such that increased friction yielded decreased acceleration. each of their lines on their graphs were lower for increased friction meaning that y corresponds to acceleration and x corresponds to mass.
in regards to error systematic error could have stemmed from the computerized measuring system being off by a certain amount. random error could have stemmed from a slightly different setup for the system before each trial. the systematic error would have made it so that each of our data points was either higher or lower than the correct amount by however much error the measuring system had. the random error would skew our results by small amounts in either the higher or lower direction. to reduce random error we tried to set the cart at the same place each time along with having the same person from our group setup the trial every time. finally, we followed all lab instructions as closely as possible to reduce error.
extreme heights were unable to be tested so those could be considered constraints to the generalizability of our results as extreme heights could change our conclusions.
our experimental models are consistent with newtonâ€™s second law because the force of gravity and mass are on the right side of the equation and yield acceleration which is on the left side of the equation as y. these elements can then be rearranged to form $f = m a$.
