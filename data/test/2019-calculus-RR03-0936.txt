Discussion and Conclusion
The research question of “What affects the period of a pendulum?” was investigated through three experiments that tested how the length of the string, mass, and angle affect the period of a pendulum.  
Experiment 1 (results shown in data table 1) investigated how the length of the string affected the period. Through this experiment it has become clear that the length of the pendulum does affect the period in a positive linear relationship between length of the string and time of the period. However, when experiments 2 and 3 (results shown in data tables 2 and 3) were conducted no trend was found that connected length of the period and mass or angle. From this information a claim can be made that the angle and mass do not affect the period of a pendulum. 
	The mathematical model was created by using the chart below (Figure 5) to graph (figure 6) and examine the relationship between the length of the string and the length of the period. The length of the string was used to make the mathematical data because it was the only factor that affected the period. It was found that the relationship between the length of the string and the period was a power relationship. This differs from our original claim of a linear relationship. The claim was revised once Experiment 1 was repeated with a more precise timing mechanism (photo gates instead of stopwatches). Upon the repetition of Experiment 1 the level of uncertainty was reduced to .013. This model has an R value of .987 and an equation of $y=2.0614$
The random errors that occurred were mostly due to the stopwatch being stopped based on human reaction causing an inaccurate time. It is almost impossible to stop and start the watch at the exact same spot every time. Inaccurate measurements of the string length and angle could have affected the accuracy of the data. Although not proven, a systematic error could have occurred if the stopwatch is in correctly calibrated. We have no evidence of this error but the photo gate was accurate to within a .001 s, but this method was only used when Experiment 1 was repeated. If the experiment were to be repeated the random errors could be reduced by doing more than three trials. Ten trials would be sufficient in eliminating random errors. Lastly, some constraints that would limit the generalization of this experiment could be the amount of times each trial is repeated and the gravitational force. The amount of times each trial is repeated will improve the accuracy of the results. If this experiment were to be conducted on the moon, then the gravitational force would decrease the acceleration of the pendulum. Thus, causing the period to increase.
