discussion and conclusion: 

in the past three weeks, our group tested if the angle in which a pendulum was released, the mass of the pendulum, and the length of the string in which it swung directly impacted the overall period of the pendulum. throughout the experiment in week one, our first objective was to determine if the string length impacted the period. our hypothesis was that the string would have an effect on the period of the pendulum. the dependent variable was determined to be the period of the pendulum while the independent variable is the length of the string. our control variables were the mass of the pendulum (250g) and the angle at which the pendulum was released (from 10 and increased by 5 degrees up to 30 degrees). errors that occurred in week one included is  the pendulum hitting the apparatus during multiple trials which lead us to conducting even more trials and finally gathering enough evidence that during our week one experiment the length of the string of the pendulum impacted the period of the pendulum significantly.  our certainty was about .8 due to our data being very close to the best fit line in figure 1.1 . 

during week two, our specific lab section was cancelled for that day, we were given data with an angle at which the pendulum was released and times in which it took the pendulum to complete one full period. we were also given the standard deviation. independent variables within this trial was the length in string in which the pendulum swung and the mass in which the pendulum had. controls were the angle in which the pendulum was released. our hypothesis remained the same for the length that the pendulum would be impacted, however we also predicted that the mass of the pendulum would impact the period as well. as shown in figure 2.3 when the mass of the pendulum increases, the period in which the pendulum swings should also increase. there were two outlying data points however, and with this uncertainty we could redo the trials and measure the pendulum for 6 periods and then dividing the time by 6 to estimate a more accurate period however, a close observation will be needed to make sure that the time of the pendulum is stopped and started accurately. our overall certainty was .56 which indicates that our values are at average and we are able to accept our data. 

last week, using a mathematical model of 1.99x^.5 we were able to determine a yield of 3.99x^.7562 with a confidence of .9. from out data, we were able to determine a mathematical model for how the length of the string from which a pendulum is suspended is related to the period of the pendulum. in our graph, the errors were not very far apart from one another. this allows us to conclude that our data was collected with a high level of certainty. from our calculated model we were able to determine that the length of the string does impact the period of the pendulum. during our experiment, we kept the angle from which the pendulum was suspended constant at an angle of 15 degrees. we also kept the mass of the pendulum constant at 150 g. we are about 80% confident in the numbers we got. we used the same procedure to record each different measurement. we could’ve used more consistent measurements to get a constant time for each measurement. the trendline stays in a linear line and runs through each of the different points of data. r^2 represents the regression in a graph. our regression is 96.4% which tells us that the regression model fits our graph. we had relatively close claims to the other two groups that were not that much off of ours. our $y=3.9904 x^{0.7}$ was very similar as to the other groups y equation. thus, our claim is more confident due to the consistent numbers with other groups. adjustments that could have been made to strengthen our data would be is  to collect more data to observe a constant growth or decay in our trials, choose lengths of string that are closer together to create a stable graph with valid data, and using a ruler to measure to confirm that the pendulum is being released for a straight path to complete the period. flaws in our experimental design include the experimental error within measuring the length of the string to the exact meter, creating a “perfectly” straight path for the pendulum to swing one full period, and using strings lengths that are relatively close, but not close enough for a constant graph. all of these controls could be made better by using the techniques stated above. with these controls changed, we feel that the data would reflect a more logical outcome and graphed data. although our data shown above does reflect a logical outcome for the period of a pendulum, these changes in our controls could greatly impact our data and y value. 

	finally, we can determine that the length of the string for a pendulum as well as the angle and mass impact the period in which the pendulum swings. our graphs, charts, data sets, and mathematical models allow us to conclude that our trials were of a specific certainty (above .56) in which we are able to accept our hypothesis. our data shows that the mass, angle, and length of string in which a pendulum swings impacts the total period of the pendulum. although constraints such as space in a lab and time to complete the experiment were applied, we can concur that these constraints did not affect the generalizability of these results.
