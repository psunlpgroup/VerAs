conclusion

	other groups tested how friction affects the mathematical models and their data is shown below
the trend in teams 2, 4, and 6 data is abundantly clear that the larger the increase in friction results in a slower acceleration. this makes sense for friction is always opposing movement and in this instance its opposing acceleration. this adds to our understanding of our mathematical model for the small deviations in our model to the theoretical model could be attributed by these external forces of friction and gravity.

	we are very confident in our data although there may be some random and systematic error in our data. for instance despite the high precision our our measuring tools they aren't completely precise and our numbers will be off because of that. to reduce this in the future we could use more precise equipment. this would random error. another form of error may come from our experiment setup for many assumptions were made such as a perfectly level track, and a frictionless pulley. this would be another example of random error and to reduce this in the future we could measure the tilt of the track better and find how much friction is caused by the pulley.

some constraints that may limit our generalizability of our results would be our range of masses we used and the source of gravity that affected our force applied.	these constraints may limit what we know about extreme masses our very intense gravity for our mathematical model may not suit those extremes.

	our mathematical model for mass vs acceleration is  $y = 0.329 x^{-1.031}$ given this shows an inverse relationship just as $f = m a$ theoretical model has mass and acceleration being perfect inverses of each other. this value is 1 / 0.3395kg is 2.9455 kg^-1.  in our mathematical model this value is 3.1296 kg^-1. these two values are reasonably close considering that friction and the tilt will affect this value. the small variations in our numbers gives us confidence in our mathematical model as well as the theoretical model. the mathematical model for force applied vs acceleration is $y = 0.3529 x+0.0013$ this equation shows a direct relationship of force applied to acceleration just as $f = m a$ does. the value is .0363/.3395 which is  0.1069 n. the value of the applied force on the cart is .0363/.3005 which is  .1208n. these values are very close but there is more force on the cart because the tilt is not going to apply to the end of the string as much as it would for the cart.
