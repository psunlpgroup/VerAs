discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to create a mathematical model and describe the behavior of a real system.  we also conducted an experiment to understand what the values mean in the mathematical models. 
the first two mathematical models are based off of the theoretical equation $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ .  the last mathematical model is based off of the enhanced theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. 										        the experiments in lab 05 and lab 06 helped us create and understand a mathematical model for the acceleration of a system with respect to the hanging force and the mass of the cart.  these models were created by taking many data points in each experiment and graphing the min excel.  the first experiment that was conducted was using a constant system mass, and an increasing hanging force.  this was done by transferring some of the mass from the cart to the hanging force and measuring the acceleration of the cart when the hanging force dropped.  we found that the relationship between the hanging force and the acceleration of the system was linear.  this was expected as stated in our prediction.  the mathematical model for experiment one is as follows is  $a = 2.4819 f_h - 0.0513$.  this was found using the graph presented as graph 1.
the second experiment was conducted with a varying mass, but a constant hanging force.  the mass of the cart was increased slowly to find a relationship between the mass of the cart and the acceleration of the system.  as with the first experiment, we dropped the constant mass and measured the acceleration of the system.  our data suggests that the correlation between mass and acceleration is a negative linear relationship.  when consulting other groups, we saw that our data was in fact incorrect.  the error that we experienced will be discussed later in this lab report.  the mathematical model is as follows is  $a = 0.2 f_h^{0.464}$.  this was found using the graph presented as graph 2.
experiment three was an investigation of the systematic errors that we could have experienced when conducting experiments 1 and 2.  our group was assigned to research the affect of friction on the acceleration of the mass.  we predicted that it would decrease the slope of the graph, which means that the acceleration would still be present, but it would be less than that of a perfectly frictionless surface.  during the experiment, we used magnets mounted on the cart and repeated the first experiment in lab 05.  the magnets, when mounted on the side of the cart, created an eddy current that simulated the force of friction.  we preformed three different trials in three different configurations of the magnets.  the first configuration was with all the magnets on top of the cart, producing no eddy currents, therefore no friction.  the second configuration was with two magnets mounted on the side and two on top.  this was considered “medium friction”.  the final set up was with all four magnets mounted on the side of the cart, producing the greatest artificial friction force.  in our data it produced three different linear graphs all with varying slopes.  we believe our data was skewed due to the air track we were using.  the mathematical model that we found is as follows is  $y = 2.0401 x +0.1156$. this model is based after the equation $a = c1 w +c2$
group 2 conducted the same experiments as us during lab 06.  their data was slightly more accurate than ours for an unknown reason.  the reason why i say that their data is more accurate is because the slopes of the graphs do not change, where ours does.  the changing value should be the y-intercept, as shown in group 2’s data.
group 5 conducted the experiment of increasing the forward tilt of the air track and measuring the the acceleration when the tilt is increased.  they found the same conclusion as group 2 did.  the only varying value is the y-intercept of the graph.  the slope of every graph is the same, which proves that the systematic error should only shift the graph, not change any of the data points.
the errors that can be accounted for in our experiment are very large, seeing that our data was so different than the other group the performed the same experiment as us.  we don’t know exactly why our data was so incorrect, but we believe that it is because our air track was not outputting enough air, so the cart was coming in contact with the track, producing an unaccounted-for friction force.  theoretically this would only shift the data and not change it, but we discovered that the cart was only coming in contact with the track when the mass of the cart increased which means that it would in fact change the data points individually.  other than that, we conducted the experiment very well.  the only error that could be present is that of a very tiny positive or negative initial velocity given to the cart when released.  error could also be present when we were finding the acceleration on the lab computer, by taking a non-specific number of points to find the slope of the velocity time graph.

the generalizability of our results was limited by the fact that we only took 8 data points per acceleration force, and acceleration mass graphs (graphs 1 and 2).  like mentioned before, if we could have considered more points on the lab computer when finding the acceleration, it would make our data more accurate and generalized.  this could be done by having a longer string and track.  it could also be more generalized by having a greater variation on the mass changes of the hanging force on the cart.  

our mathematical models were consisted with newtons second law because when the force of the hanging mass was increased, the acceleration increased.  this is very apparent in the law .  when the mass increased, the acceleration had to decrease, as seen in graph 2.  in lab 06, newtons second law was consistent with our model, because when taking the sum of all forces, the tension force and the friction force had to be accounted for, which changed the acceleration.  all of our experiments were consistent with newton’s second law.  if the experiment was conducted with a heavy string instead of the light string that was provided, it would increase the total mass of the system.  if the total mass of the system was included in newtons second law, it wouldn’t change the graphs at all.  the reason is because the forces of the strings would cancel out and become 0, having no impact on the acceleration of the system.
