discussion and conclusion

the question being asked for this experiment is: what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? during this experiment, 3 variables were tested to see their effect on the period of a pendulum. we predicted that the variable which would affect the period of the pendulum would be altering the length of the string, this prediction was in fact correct. figure 1 shows a graph that displays a clear and consistent separation of period length when the length of the string is changed. the error bars and lines of best fit show consistency between trials, representing what seems to be accurate data. also, by looking at the data from table 1, you will see exact times, showing that the longer the string – the longer the period, with a proportional increase with length and time.

in figure 2, a much less clear graph is shown for testing different angles of release. this is due to a small change in values on the y-axis. however, if the data in table 2 is looked at closely, you will see how close all of the times for each trial compare, no matter what the angle of release is. this lack of separation in trials makes for a cross of error bars, as well as, lines of best fit – proving there is no true effect on the period of the pendulum when the angle of release is changed.

the third variable that was tested was changing the weight on the pendulum. in figure 3, you will see another unclear graph, this is due to the values (expressed in table 3) being so consistent between all three of the differing weights tested. the error bars and lines of best fit also overlap, showing consistency of periods for every mass. this data proves that when the weight on the pendulum is altered, the period of a swing is unaffected. 

figure 4 is showing a second test ran to confirm a period change when the length of string is altered. the r^2 value of 0.9932 represents a power function, determining that the data has correlation, as well as, a proportional relationship between period and length of string. this portion of the experiment was done using a laser to get accurate measurements for the period, taking the human error of using a hand timer out of the question.

during the experiment, the experimental constraints were minimal. hand-timing was eliminated with the use of a laser for more precision, but the physical release of the pendulum still relied on a member of our groups hand – which is a likely factor for why every measurement was not identical. when releasing the pendulum by hand, factor of using accidental force in any direction come into play and are extremely likely to happen. any additional force added other than gravity would affect the path of the pendulum, and ultimately the results of the experiment.

in conclusion, our prediction that when testing the length of string, angle of release, and mass of pendulum for which variable will alter the period of a pendulum - the length of string will be the only variable to have an effect, was indeed correct. the relationship showed that when the length of string is increased, the time of one period for the pendulum will increase proportionally. this is all proven in the figures titled figure 1 and figure 4, as well as, table 1 and table 4.
