conclusion:

	the purpose of lab 5 and 6 was to see how changes to the independent variable, the force applied, would affect the dependent variable, which is the acceleration of the system. factors which must be kept constant were the gravitational pull of the system, the period in which the system is allowed to accelerate, and the friction applied to the system. these factors were kept constant using a measured track (87 cm) that was producing air to limit and control the amount of friction. using the parameters described in figure 1, the data in figure 2 was produced, these values were graphed as described in figure 3. using figure 3 the mathematical model of $y=5.4 x - 0.031$ with a external force of .0058 n was derived. this was derived using $\frac{1}{m_{system}}=c1$ and  $\frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}} = c2$ when $y=c1 x+c2$. the r^2 of this model was .9995, or almost 1, meaning that the relationship between the change in applied force and the change in acceleration of the system is significant. this can also be seen in the graph, figure 3, where the error bars do not overlap, and as the hanging mass increases so does the acceleration of the system. this mathematical model is accurate, as similar trials ran by seperate groups generated models such as 5.01x-.0018 (fe is  .002n)  and 4.8456x-.019 (fe is  .0039n). these equation also conform to $f=m a$, or more exactly they are similar to the rearranged $a=\frac{f}{m}$. the one difference between this theoretical equation, and the derived ones is that c2 is a negative number in the derived equations, while it is zero theoretically. this could be due to not considering friction, which while lessened by the air table, is not removed entirely. other errors could have been caused by incorrect measurements, like masses. this could either increase or decrease our estimated accelerations, based on how much the scale is off by. other errors could arise from the cart not being released from the exact same distance each time. these errors could have been reduced or removed by calculating the force of friction, and including it in the equation, using more accurate scales, or calibrating the used ones more effectively to find the true hanging mass, and by measuring the release location more diligently to ensure the same distance to accelerate is given each time. these variables are also constrained, limiting results. the mass is limited, reducing the number amount of change in the mass of the hanging apparatus. distance was also limited, constraining the amount the system could accelerate.
