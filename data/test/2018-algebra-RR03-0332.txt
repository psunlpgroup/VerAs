discussion and conclusion

	the research question being investigated in this lab experiment was what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. the research question was addressed by changing the independent variables and test how they affect the period of a pendulum (dependent variable). the three independent variables tested in this experiment were initial angle of release (degrees), mass at the end of a pendulum (grams), and the length of the pendulum string (cm). the first independent variable that was tested was the initial angle of release. according to figure 1.2, the graph shows that there is no relationship between the initial angle of release (iv) and the period of the pendulum (dv), as the slope of the line is very small, being 0.026, which is close to horizontal or zero. the second independent variable that was tested in the experiment was the mass of the pendulum. the data collected and figure 2.2 shows that there is no relationship between the mass of the pendulum (iv) and the period of the pendulum (dv) as the slope is very small and is close to 0. lastly, the third independent variable that was tested in this lab was the length of the pendulum. according to figure 3.2, the graph shows that there is a relationship between the length of the pendulum (iv) and the period of the pendulum (dv) as the data shows a positive relationship and the data consistently rises with no overlap of uncertainty between data points. 

	since it was known that the independent variable of the string length had a relationship with the period of the pendulum, another trial was done with the use of a photogate so that more accurate data could be obtained with very little error. these trials confirmed the original findings that there is a relationship between the length of string and period of pendulum. then, the data in table 4 was used to calculate the standard deviation value which was 0.0155. this value was used to add error bars to all the graphs to see if there was a relationship between the independent and dependent variable based on the equivalency criterion. figure 3.2, the slope is positive showing a relationship between the string length and period of a pendulum. the mathematical model for this figure is a power equation. the theoretical equation for this was $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ which then was simplified to $y=c \sqrt{x}$. our experimental equation was $y=0.1944 x^{0.5064}$. our c2 value was very close to .5 which shows that our experimental equation was correct. 

	some random errors that could have occurred during this lab are not starting/stopping the stopwatch exactly the time of release, increasing/decreasing initial degree of release prior to trial. random errors can be reduced by doing multiple trials so that the average can be obtained to get a more accurate time, and a motion detecting stopwatch could be used to get accurate periods of pendulum. some systematic errors that occurred could have been that the weights donâ€™t weigh exactly what is written on them (chips, scratches, plates being worn down over time could lead to a decrease in mass), and the measuring tape could be broke or improperly made leading to inaccurate measurements. these could be reduced by using a machine that releases the pendulum at an exact angle of release and in a straight direction, a new set of weights could be obtained for this experiment, lastly, a new and sturdier measuring tape could be used so that you can compare the original tape to one that is not stretched out, bent, or broken.  one constraint for this lab was time. to get precise, more accurate data multiple trials had to be done for each independent variable that was being tested, yet this could not have been able to be done as time was a limiting factor. if there was no time limit, more trials could have been done giving us more accurate results.
