discussion and conclusion:



        this lab was conducted in order to determine how a change in applied force affects the acceleration of a weighted cart. the question was tested by placing a metal cart on an air track, having a certain mass hanging from a string attached to the cart and recording the acceleration of the cart once it was launched from a certain point on the track. attached to the cart, were plastic bobbers that added additional weight and made up the hanging weight. for each trial, the mass of the system had to be equal, so the bobbers were disturbed in different amount to not offset the system. an electronic data collector complied the data into a graph, and after taking the slope of velocity line produced, the acceleration was obtained, along with its uncertainty, calculated by the program. this data can be seen in table 2. from that data, the force was calculated by multiplying the mass in kilograms of the cart system by the acceleration of each trial. figure 1 shows the force plotted against the acceleration of the cart, which shows that the acceleration of the cart does increase when the force applied increases. this result does make sense because according to newton’s second law is  when mass is constant, the force is equal to mass times acceleration ($f = m a$). so as the acceleration increased, the force applied would also increase.  

       the hypothesis made stated that the force did affect acceleration and the prediction was that force and acceleration would have a direct correlation. the data found in the experiment was also compared to two other groups. figure 2 shows that group squrt determined force and acceleration were directly correlated and can be seen on their graph. this supports the hypothesis made as well as the prediction. referring to figure 3, team the uncertainties also discovered a linear relationship between force and acceleration, thus hypothesis and prediction was again supported. the equation of the line found from the graph can be compared to the theoretical model. the theoretical model is $f=m_{system} a$ while the experimental model was found to be $a=m x+b$, where m, the slope, is the inverse of the mass of the system, x is the force and b, the y-intercept, is the funknown/msystem. the theortical model can be expanded to look closer to the equation of the line found in the experiment. the expanded theortical model would be is 



the funknown is present in the experimental model because friction and air resistance are not taken into account for the experiment. the experimental model still supports this theoretical model because the mass of the system is constant so even if the forces are unknown, an increase in force will still increase the acceleration. another force not taken into account is the tension in the string that connects the hanging mass to the cart. the string tension could slightly effect uniform acceleration because it would add another force but the cart would still accelerate rather consistently. the weight of the string would be accounted for in the mass of the system but the force of tension in the string would not. after completing the experiment, the data collected does support the prediction and hypothesis that applied force does affect acceleration and that they have a direct correlation. 



      there were a few errors to take into account. a random error of sorts skewed the line equation in figure 1. it was believed to be an error with unit conversion but after redoing the conversions, there seemed to be an error within excel. the graph still supported the hypothesis but when compared to figures 2 and 3, the slope on figure 1 was much larger. among the random error, there were also possible systematic errors. for example, there could have been a small amount of friction or air resistance present during the experiment, which would slow the acceleration found. another systematic errors would be the point of release for the cart being slightly different for each trial. there was also possible constraints, being that the air track could have been on a slight incline, which was not factored into the experiment as well as not knowing all of the unknown forces. since it’s not completely clear which forces were unknown, the experimental model wouldn’t be very generalizable.
