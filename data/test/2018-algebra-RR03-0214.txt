conclusion

the results found were that mass does not affect the period but the relationship between angle vs period and length vs period affects the period in a positive way which coincides with the hypothesis. error bars were added to better understand the relationship between period and the independent variable. an error occurred though, when testing the angle length. there is an outlier that doesnâ€™t follow the trend which effects our results. even with the error the data shows that an increase in angle by 5 degrees or 10 degree is negligible amount of difference.
the standard deviation calculated came out to be 0.011276327. with the standard deviation, we can determine where most of the data should fall under. anything to high or shows that some sort of error occurred during the process.
the relationship between the length and the period is nonlinear. the type of curve that best fits the data is the power curve. the uncertainty for the period was 0.001 second. the error bars are on the graph, but they are so small that they are almost invisible. on our graph, the length is measured in centimeters. the theoretical equation is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ and the experimental equation is $y = 0.193 x^{0.508}$ (length is in centimeters). using the theoretical model, having a length of 0.5 meters would result in a period of 1.419 seconds. using the experimental model, having a length of 0.5 meters would result in a period of 1.408 seconds. comparing the two the data shows that theory holds true the answers are nearly identical. if you were to construct a pendulum with a period of 5 seconds, using the theoretical model you would need a length of 6.2 meters. using the experimental model with a period of 5 seconds you would need a length of 6.05 meters. you can use any mass since we have already determined that mass does not affect the period. again, both the equations give a very similar number.
many random errors could have occurred due to human error. an error occurred during the angle vs period experiment which could have been a resultant of any human error. all the possible errors that could have occurred was improper counting of when the pendulum went pass, improper measurement of mass, length, and angle, not starting the stopwatch in time, and many variables effecting the swing of the pendulum. all these errors could have skewed the outcome in a positive or negative way. adding the photogate reduced some error. systematic error also could have occurred but calculating the standard deviation allows the data to be as accurate as possible.

there were many constraints to this experiment. one big one is time. given more time, each experiment can be performed more precise and allowing more trials to each experiment. other constraints include the using a protractor to measure angle and using a small string that could have been affected by wind easily.
