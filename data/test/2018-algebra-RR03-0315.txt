discussion and conclusion 

the research question investigated during this lab was what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. the three experiments helped us test how three different independent variables impacted the time that it took to complete one period. for angles based on graph 1 we can assume that the angle of release did not have an impact on the period time this is based on the fact that the error bars overlap this shows that they all can fall within each other and may or may not have changed showing that there is no impact. for the independent variable of mass once again we can infer that there was no impact on the period based on the fact that the error bars in graph 2 overlap meaning that at any mass the time of the period can be equal to each other showing that there is no impact. the only independent variable that we can assume had an impact on the period is the length in which none of the error bars overlapped in graph 3 showing that there was a significant impact on the period this is further supported in graph 4 from lab 3 which follows the same aspects but since there was more trials it minimized the random errors.

the theoretical mathematical model for the period is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ where l is equal to length, g is gravity, and t is the length in time of the period the our data fits the equation because as graphs 3 and 4 show only length makes a difference which makes sense since length is in the equation whereas mass and angles aren’t in the equation shows why based on graphs 1 and 2 there was no impact on the period.

the possible random errors that occurred were the measuring of angles which had to be estimated based on the dashes the same goes for the length of the pendulum and the mass and another major random error was the recording of time based on the reaction speed to stop the timer. these random errors were dealt with by running more trials and taking the average. some possible systematic errors were the scale not being zeroed in which we just zeroed out to eliminate the error. another systematic error was an in accurate measuring tape in which we switched out to get rid of the error. the other possible systematic error is the accuracy of the protractor which could be fixed by using a different protractor.

the main major constraint is that there was a lack of repetition which makes the results not the most accurate meaning that you can’t assume everything will show similar results. another constraint is the equipment used would not necessarily mean that all different setups used will have the same results. another constraint is that there might be an unknown variable that was not accounted for that may have affected the results making them less accurate or may effect future experiments.
