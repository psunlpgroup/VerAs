discussion and conclusion



	the research question that we tested was: what effects the period of a pendulum or small swings? based on the three various experiments performed over the course of the three weeks, it can be determined that only the length of the pendulum string effects the period of a pendulum. after testing the mass of the bob (see tables 1 and 4 and figure 1), the length of the string (with and without a photogate; see tables 2, 5, and 7 and figures 2 and 4), and the release angle (see tables 3 and 6 and figure 3), it can be said with confidence that length of the string will determine the period average and there is no relationship between period average and mass or angle released. in figure 1, the error bars of the mass of pendulum vs. period average data points overlap. this means that there is no relationship between the two variables. for them to have a relationship, the error bars would need to clearly not overlap. this is because, with error bars, the high end of one range could be the same as the low end of another error bar. this means, in theory, they could be the same number due to uncertainty. figure 3 shows this same occurrence with the release angle vs. period average. because of this, the hypotheses that mass and angle would have a relationship with period average should not be supported. figure 2 shows the relationship between pendulum length vs. period average, but the strength of the relationship is questionable. the uncertainty lines are close but one clearly doesn’t overlap the others. because of this possible relationship, further testing was done to strengthen these results. using photogate equipment, the relationship between the two variables was represented more accurately. it shows a very clear, exponential relationship, as seen in figure 4. it shows that the average period can be found with the following equation is  $t=0.1944 l^{0.5062}$. the photogate was very accurate and measured the period much better than the human eye could. because of this, that experiment had more credibility. therefore, the hypothesis stating that the length of string would have a relationship with period average should be supported. further testing should be done to improve accuracy in these results and findings for mass vs. period average and release angle vs. period average. this could also reduce any random errors with how it was performed or systematic errors in the equipment used. some errors that could have taken place could be is  not checking the accuracy of the equipment before starting, which would result in systematic error, not timing the same way every time, moving the pendulum to a different degree after moving the protractor away, and many more. to improve on this, the experimenter should compare their equipment with reliable equipment to make sure it is aligned and accurate. this would greatly reduce systematic error. to degrease random error, the time should be taken from the same spot, the same way for all of the trials and independent variables. leaving the protractor in a good spot so it can be easily seen at all times to make sure the release angle remains the same and doesn’t budge would decrease angle errors. also, the experimenter’s own data should be taken for all three independent variables to keep the testing conditions consistent. since this group did not get to test all three on the first experimental date, data from a different group (group 5 in section 007) had to be used. the other group could have used different, unreliable techniques that could throw off the data gathered. more data should be gathered with better accuracy and more reliable methods and equipment to fully understand and conclude the results.
