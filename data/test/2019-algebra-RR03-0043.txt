conclusion:
The goal of this research was to determine what factors (mass, length of string, angle of release) impacted the amount of time in seconds it took a pendulum to complete one full period. The mass of the pendulum was not shown to impact the length of time it took the pendulum to complete one period, though initially the data appeared to show a relationship, however, when error bars were added to the graph of the data, the equivalency criteria showed too much overlap. The data for angle of release as a factor effecting the amount of time needed to complete a period had similar results and is not significant under the equivalency criteria as the error bars have significant overlap when the data is graphed. For both of these variables, it cannot be stated that any variations in the amount of time it took the pendulum to complete a period are due to anything other than chance and error. The graph for the length of the string versus the period length of the pendulum was the only one that showed a relationship between the independent and dependent variables, even when error was accounted for the ranges of the points did not overlap.  The claim can be made that as the length of the string increases, the amount of time needed for the pendulum to complete one period increases. 
	Constraints of this information include the relatively small sample size and number of trials that could make it difficult generalize this information, though the similarity to the theoretical values does support its validity.  
	The theoretical equation for the period length of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. The theoretical data shows that the graph should be $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. Our graph of the data gave an equation $T=4.4635 L^{0.8415}$ with an R2 value of 0.9638. These equations are related, but not the same; according to the theoretical equation L should be raised to the power of 0.5. This discrepancy could be attributed to both random and systematic errors that occurred while carrying out these experiments. Theoretically, this equation should lead to a line with an R^2 value of one, however due to systematic and random errors this is rarely achievable in a laboratory setting as the theoretical values are based on every aspect being perfectly controlled.
