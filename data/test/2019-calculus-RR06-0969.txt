discussion and conclusion

lab 5 involved two separate experiments. during the first experiment of this lab, we tested the relationship between the mass of the hanging bob and the acceleration. during the second experiment we compared the mass of the slotted weight to the acceleration of the system. we then developed mathematical models for both of these relationships. in lab 6, we tested how the friction of the track affects the acceleration.

regarding the two experiments in lab 5, we determined our mathematical models by utilizing the functions of excel. using the data collected from these first two experiments, we entered the sets of data into excel and formed chart which displayed the mathematical equation associated with the slope. for the first experiment of lab 5, applied force versus acceleration, the graph displayed a positive slope (figure 1); this indicates a positive relationship between the variables. the theoretical mathematical model would look like $a =\frac{f_h+f_u}{m}$ ((1*force due to hanging bobs)/mass)+(unknown force/mass). comparing that to our numbers, we find that the unknown force is 0.0049 n. for the second experiment, mass of the sled and bobs versus acceleration, the graph displayed a negative slope (figure 2); this indicates a negative relationship. for lab 6, the mathematical model was determined by the same process. we found a negative correlation between the friction and the acceleration. this is shown through figures 3, 4, and 5.

 their data agrees with ours in that we both came to the same conclusion that acceleration decreases as friction increases.
this whiteboard shows the data collected from a group that test a different hypothesis than we did (data from group 1)
the information collected by this group shows us that the height of the tilt is negatively correlated with the acceleration of the system. from this, we learn that the height of the tilt and the acceleration both have a similar relationship with friction.

during lab 5, error may have been caused due to the varying amounts of string hanging off the pulley in each trial. this would have slightly altered the amount of weight hanging off of the pulley, therefore making the acceleration appear slightly lower or higher than its actual value. to fix this in the future, we could test for how the weight of the string affects the acceleration. in lab 6, error may have been caused due to the mass of the system and the slope of the track. these could be reduced by keeping the masses the same for each trial.

time was a major constraint involved in both labs. we only had the two la periods to get the experiments done, and with more time we may have been able to conduct more trials to obtain more accurate results. the lengths of the track could also be seen as a constraint. if we a had released the cart from a further distance it is possible that the graphs may have displayed slightly different data.

newtonâ€™s second law,  $f=m a$, can b rewritten as $a=\frac{f}{m}$. this is displayed in the lab 5 as the acceleration of the system is equal to the force of the hanging weight and the unknown force combined, then divided by the mass. in lab 6, our mathematical model has the form $y= c1 f+c2$. c(1) represents (1/mass)*fhanging. our experimental values of c(1) for trials 1, 2, and 3 respectively were 2.941, 2.407, and 2.100. these were slightly lower than the ideal values which were 3.035, 2.540, and 2.191.
