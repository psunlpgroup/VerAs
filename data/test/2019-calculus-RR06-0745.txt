discussion:

the main purpose of lab 5 was to develop mathematical models that describe a real system and support the equation net $f=m a$. additionally, the main purpose of lab 6 was to understand these variables and how they fit in with the equation as well as testing the effects of a change in the lab setting.

the proper mathematical models for each experiment was determined using a line of best fit in excel; the curve fit that had the highest r^2 value was used for each graph. based on our mathematical models, we can say that an increase in the hanging mass is actually an increase on the force applied to the cart. also, in the equation c1f+c2, we can say the slope, c1, is the inverse mass while c2 is the frictional force based on our test with the magnets and a comparison with the equation (sum of f)/m. the same method can be used to find the meaning of each value in the experiment of acceleration vs. mass of cart. the mathematical data is a direct result of our data because the trendline is fitted from the data and the equation is the one that best fits the line as determined by excel.
based on the conclusions of two other groups in our lab period, we can be more confident in our results since the numbers that were calculated are similar and they came to a similar conclusion as us. also, because of these two groups, we were able to understand what might affect the results of a lab in terms of the lab setting.
systematic errors that may have been present in the experiment include a slight constant force of friction that was unaccounted for that would decrease the acceleration of the cart. also, if there was a slight tilt in the track, the acceleration would increase or decrease accordingly. random errors that are possible in the experiment are measurement errors regarding the mass of the bobs and the distance the cart traveled. to reduce the possible systematic errors, we could run tests to ensure that the track is completely horizontal and that the friction is negligible. also, to reduce random error, we could use more precise measuring tools.
constraints that limit the results of the experiment are the limited mass of the bobs preventing tests at extreme numbers, the length of track allowing for only a small period of measurement, and the length of string preventing longer runs as well.
our two mathematical models are consistent with newtonâ€™s second law that net $f=m a$ because in both of our equations, we established that the constants represented a certain variable and had units to match the equation as discussed earlier. also, to be sure of this statement, we can think about the three variable that were tested in the experiment is  mass, acceleration, and force.
