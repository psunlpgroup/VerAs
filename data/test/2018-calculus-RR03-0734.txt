conclusion

the question that we are trying to solve throughout this experiment is which of the three independent variables truly change the period of the swings. in the end, we found out that length of the string was the only variable that changes the period of the swings. 

in the first experiment, the independent variable was mass. in figure 2, the graph shows how the mass does not affect the period. the period stays horizontal and close to the same time for each interval of mass. in the second experiment, we looked at angle and came to the same conclusion as the first experiment. from figure 3 and 4, the data collected and the graph show that even with the different angles, the period did not change. however, when we conducted the third experiment, the length changed the time of the period. in figure 5 and 6, the data and the graph show that the changes in length does change the period of swings. 

the theoretical mathematical model used for this lab is . with this mathematical model, we found that our constants to be close to the values of the original equation. our mathematical model became  and it is the full model because we tested the independent variables and only used the one that we found that impacts the period to calculate the model. displayed by figure 6, the length is not necessarily linear. the curve was fitted to display the equation that passes through these points. 

we had ideas about what random or systematic errors we would have throughout the lab. first random error would be human error. we discussed that if certain errors, like we miss taking down the right time, the weight would be at the wrong angle, or we didn’t release the weight at the right time, would cause discrepancy with our data. a systematic error that we kept seeing was the string being pulled or overused from previous labs. what we did to reduce these issues was by taking multiple measurements as discussed before. by doing this, we had a average for each measurement instead of just one. even though that helped, it was not the only thing that we did. we made sure to go back over the measurements and made sure that we were confident that they were like, shown in figure 6, the time taken for the graph was for one swing and not 10. so, we had to go back through each measurement and made sure that they were correct. 

we didn’t have many constraints within the lab. the only constraint that i can think of is time during the first week of lab. we didn’t have that much to prepare or conduct the lab and we had to many questions that were unanswered throughout the lab, but even with this constraint, we were able to continue the lab and figure everything we needed out.
