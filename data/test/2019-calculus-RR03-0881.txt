discussion and conclusion

	in this experiment, we sought to figure out what impacts the swing of the pendulum for small swings. to test this research question, we chose the variables that could factor into the swing of the pendulum for small swings. those variables are the string length, the mass of the pendulum itself, and the angle at which we released the pendulum.

    the string length was the most definite answer we got from this experiment. we began this experiment predicting that as the string length was increased so would the time and vice versa. using our original test setup as shown in figure 1 and based on our data in figures 4a and 4b, there is an appearance of an increased slope, meaning that the period increases as the length increases. since there can be a lot of inaccuracy problems when using a stopwatch, we moved onto the test setup shown in figure 5a. this setup allowed for more accurate timekeeping and gave us more tight-knit data. with the new, more accurate setup, it was pretty obvious that the period was indefinitely increasing as the length was increased. 

    the angle proved very promising at first, but as the experiment went on it proved to be not as promising as we had previously assumed. we began this experiment predicting that as the angle was increased then the period would increase as well and vice versa. using our original setup in figure 1 and based on our data in figures 3a and 3b, there is what appears to be a positive slope. however, once looking more closely it appears that the differences between each data point (vertically) are very minuscule. this very tiny change seemed very insignificant causing us to believe it was not worth further testing. in conclusion, we determined that changing the angle did affect the period, but to a point to where it was clearly irrelevant.

    the mass showed no signs of a trend. originally, we were very confident that changing this would affect the period. we predicted that as the mass increased then the period would get small since more weight implied a faster descent. however, due to the gravity’s constant acceleration of 9.8 meters per second per second in a downward manner on every object that doesn’t get affected by wind resistance, period showed no signs of correlation with the weight of the pendulum. using the first setup shown in figure 1 and the data based on figures 2a and 2b, it can suggest that while there appears to be a correlation at first, the data, later on, proves that increasing the mass did not have an overall effect on the period of the pendulum. this lack of correlation caused us to not take it to further testing.

    the theoretical model of this is based on the graph of $y = x^{1/2}$ or the square root of x. based on the data we took after further testing the string length and curve fitting those points on the power curve it appears as though our graph closely follows that of the mathematical model stated above. for our graph, we got a power number of 0.3964 when we should have gotten a power number of 0.5. this change can be attributed to any of the errors stated later. as for our data based on the mass, it had no appearance anywhere close to that of the theoretical mathematical model above, therefore, concluding that there was the mass has no effect on the period of the pendulum. as for the angle, while it did appear as though the graph was following the theoretical model, its tiny changes vertically suggest that while it appears to, it doesn’t mean it doesn’t entirely and if it does, it matters to the tiniest degree. because of this, we concluded that the angle had very little if any effect on the period of the pendulum.

    random errors present in this lab experiment could’ve included things such as the inaccuracy of stopwatch and human error (not stopping the time on time, letting go too early or too later, and inaccurate measuring of angle, weight, or string length). to make it so these random errors don’t affect data we can take more tests per weight, length, or angle, as well as use technology and a better setup to more accurately represent that situation provided. an example is the pendulum time counter used in figure 5b. 

    systematic errors in this experiment were not found or noticed was adjusted based on any errors, systematic or random. in the future, we should look out for more systematic errors so we can get better and more accurate data. 

    constraints in this experiment involved a lack of technology. while we did have the pendulum time counter there could be other pieces of technology to help us make this experiment more accurate. another constraint is time. we only have an average of about 2 hours once a week for three weeks to do this experiment. if given more time we could’ve done more trials for each test variable allowing for random errors to be invalid.
