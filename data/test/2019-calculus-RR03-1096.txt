discussion and conclusion

the research questioned being asked and tested with experimentation, error analysis and mathematical models is “what factor, length of string, mass or angle or release, effects the period of a pendulum?”.

	in the first experiment we made a hypothesis about which factor would change the pendulum and tested it by making our own pendulum. we set it up and set the independent and controlled variable different each time to see how the pendulum would differ with a different factor being changed, while the others were controlled. we then used excel to create graphs to analyze our data we took. once observed we noticed how the mass and angle vs. time graphs showed no change of slope, while the length graph seemed to show an increase in pendulum as we increased the length in equal increments. then, we made our final conclusion that our hypothesis was correct and that length would be the only factor to effect the period of a pendulum. 

the second experiment was based on the error in our first experiment and we began by conducting much of the same experiment but this time doing ten trials with all factors as constant variables and seeing how the error would be for each. once we collected our data we graphed it all on excel again, then added error bars to the graphs of length, angle and mass vs. time. we observed and thought about the random error and systematic error that may have been present. some possible random errors that could have been a part of our trials included, our lack of perfectly measuring the angle of release with a protractor, inaccurate timing with reaction time of a stopwatch and not being able to measure the string exactly. as a string is used day by day it stretches and is not the original length recorded each time. this could have been fixed by measuring the entire string to see how long it actually is and remeasuring it every time to ensure it’s length. also using more accurate tools that include less error. one systematic error we thought of was from the scale which weighed the weights used for mass. this would be fixed in the future by using a different, more accurate scale that was calibrated correctly. when we looked at each we once again saw that the only error bars that lined up with each of the others and had smaller error bars was only the length graph. this proved yet again that even when adding error bars the correlations and trends present before were still relevant.

the final experiment was done using the length as an independent variable because it has been proven through the last two that the others have no effect and need not be tested again. this time we were more concerned with creating another graph by conducting an experiment with a photogate to get valid data and discover the equation the graph gives. the graph showed a linear relationship, but a power curve best fit the data given. we came up with $t=2.0083 l^{0.512}$ our r^2 value was 0.9971 which is close to one ensuring our trendline was accurate. we then looked at the theoretical equation, which is 2*pi*sqrt(l/g) for the period of a pendulum and compared it to our equation and ensured our prediction was correct, especially because our equation produced 2.008 and the theoretical equation produced 2.007 was only off by 0.001 from the theoretical equation value which may have been a result of measurement of the string, since we only used a tape measure. in addition, our exponent value was extremely close to 0.5 as it was 0.5128 in the graph. we also compared our work to others group as a validation and because we all came to the same conclusion with nearly the same results, we decided our hypothesis was still correct. it is still obvious that the length of string is the factor which effects the pendulum because it produced a close to perfect mathematical model and no other factor has an increasing trend or is a component in the theoretical equation.

constraints that may have limited the generalizability of the results include not testing other factors besides length of string, mass of string and angle of release. for example the air resistance was never tested as an outside factor which possibly could have a major effect on the period of pendulum. this was not tested due to the lack of resources we have in lab, but it would limit the generalizability of our results. another constraint would be not having the most accurate measurement systems to come up with the most valid results. if someone else were to do this experiment they might have more equipment to use and not only test other outside factors but also have more valid results which may show more detail then the results we found.
