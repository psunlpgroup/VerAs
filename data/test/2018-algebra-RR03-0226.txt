discussion and conclusion

the goal of this experiment was to determine whether variables such as angle of release, mass, and length affect the period of a pendulum for small swings. the variable tested first was the angle of release. multiple measurements were taken at each angle and the average was used as the data point with 4 different angles of release (see table 5). the values were then graphed and compared with the uncertainty that was calculated in lab 02 is  introduction to error analysis (see table 8) and were used to determine if the average period length differed at each angle of release. however, using the equivalency criterion (2) the error bars on each data point overlapped, suggesting that the average period length did not change from one angle of release to the next (see figure 1). this suggests that the angle of release does not have an effect on the period of a pendulum for small swings. 

next the mass of the bob was tested to determine if it played a role in affecting the period of the pendulum. multiple measurements for the period were taken at one mass before taking the average period length and moving to the next mass value (see table 6). the data was then graphed with the uncertainty previously calculated and compared with the equivalency criterion to determine if the period differed at each point (see figure 2). however, the error bars appeared to be overlapping, meaning the value, most likely, did not change, and the mass of the bob does not affect the period of the pendulum for small swings. 

	lastly, the length of the pendulum was tested to determine if it affected the pendulum just as the previous variables. measurements were taken in the same manner as the two previous variables (see table 7). the data was graphed with the same uncertainty and compared with the equivalency criterion to determine if the period varied from each point (see figure 3). unlike the other variables, however, the error bars did not appear to overlap between the points, suggesting that the length has an effect on the period of the pendulum for small swings. 

	in lab 03, measurements were taken with length as the independent variable and a more precise and accurate apparatus called photogate. the values for length also varied more drastically than those in lab 02 (see table 9). these values were graphed with the uncertainty (given as 0.001s), the trendline, and  value. the trendline that fit best was with a power equation. the equation was given as   where y is the period and x is the length (see figure 4). this equation was then compared to the theoretical model that was given as  where y is the period, l is the length, and g is gravity. although they appear very different, with a little algebra they are actually very similar. . the other variables can be ruled out as having an effect on the period as they are not seen in the theore\tical model. 

	the differences in the experimental model and the theoretical model can be attributed to different types of error. random errors in lab 01 include starting/stopping the timer inaccurately, inaccurately measuring length. these errors are reduced by taking multiple measurements at one value and taking the average before moving on to the next value. there werenâ€™t any systematic errors present in lab 01, however, an experimenter could experience an inaccuracy in the timer that is not due to user error like a delay in the mechanism to start and stop the timer. the only way to reduce this error is to use a different timer or obtain an extremely precise way of taking the delay into account to the time measured. the differences in the theoretical and experimental mathematical models could also be attributed to errors. these errors are most likely random errors such as inaccurately measuring the length of the pendulum to the middle of the bob. there was no marker or distinguishable feature to be precise in each measurement, therefore, each length measurement is probably to a different point that is merely close to the middle of the bob which would throw measurements off in the experimental model. this error can be reduced by putting a small mark on the bob to which each length measurement should be made. 

	a major constraint for this experiment is time. for example, our group ran out of time during lab 01 and did not get to finish taking our measurements. a time constraint can also make people feel rushed to finish and take inaccurate measurements because he/she might be in a hurry. this constraint could be fixed by allowing more time for the students to conduct their experiment and not feel as if they have to hurry or rush. also, the length of our pendulum could only be measured to 200 cm, therefore the experimental mathematical model that we calculated could only be generalized to pendulums up to that length.
