discussion and conclusion

	

	the purpose of this lab was to investigate how changing the force of a system (through changing the mass of the hanging weight) would affect the acceleration of a system. results were obtained by keeping the overall mass of the system the same and changing the hanging mass. this was done by adding one bob to the hanging mass for each trial, increasing the force (table 2). by doing this, the air precision track and data studio generated a slope which gave us the acceleration. data studio also generated the slope error (averages), giving the uncertainty value.  through graphing the data in excel, an equation for our experimental mathematical model was given. the experimental model from our values is  the theoretical mathematical model is given by .  using this equation, theoretically, the slope should be  the slope from the experimental mathematical is 4.49, therefore the theoretical and experimental mathematical models are similar. from this data, we can conclude that the acceleration of a system is affected by the change of force of a given system, in a linear relation. 

	reflecting on data given from group 5 (table 3) and group 3 (table 4), their data support’s our groups claim. unfortunately, group 5 (table 3) did not convert grams to kilograms, giving them inadequate data for force. however, by looking at figure 4 the majority of the class’s data supports the data our group obtained. the outlier being group 5, who did not properly convert their grams to kilograms. 

	as stated earlier, the slope of the experimental mathematical model (4.49) and the slope of the theoretical mathematical model (5.38), are closely related. this confirms that the acceleration of the system is affected by a change in force. forces other than hanging weight present in the experimental context include air resistance and force of friction. this can be taken account through the theoretical mathematical model where,  and is the force of friction. the mass is apparent in the experimental model as the slope, which is . given the experimental model , y accounts for the acceleration and x is equal to the force, therefore if we know the acceleration we are able to find the mass by dividing “x” by gravity. this will give you the hanging mass value. the non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart may affect uniform acceleration of the cart by adding tension. this could occur if there were small knots on the string. systematic errors could have been a constant inaccurate measuring of the air track and data studio. random errors could have been a fault in data studio the first time it was ran or obtaining the slope from the wrong graph. constraints in the experiment that limit the generalizability of the results are, small amount of data collected, the amount of friction and air resistance. increasing the number of trials will allow for more precise data.
