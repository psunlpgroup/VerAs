discussion & conclusion

in this lab, the question asked was “how does the acceleration of a system change when the force applied changes?”  an investigation was conducted using a cart on a “frictionless” air track to measure the effect that changing the mass hanging from one end of the string had on the overall acceleration of the system.  the system for the experiment was defined as the cart (with constant mass) on the air track, the string itself (considered to be “massless”), and the mass hanging from the other end of the string (all bobbers had constant mass).  because all components of the system had constant mass, the entire system’s mass was constant throughout.

during the first trial of the experiment, one of the eight bobbers was attached to the hanging end of the string, after which the cart was released from rest from a constant initial position (held constant throughout the experiment) and allowed to accelerate down the track while the velocity data was recorded by the sensor.  this data was plotted and the slope of the resultant plot was recorded as the acceleration, along with the error value given by the software.  this first trial with one hanging bobber was repeated to ensure accuracy, then a second bobber was moved from the cart to the hanging end of the string and the process repeated.  after two trials were conducted with each possible number of bobbers hanging from the string, the experiment was concluded.  the hanging mass from each set of trials was converted to gravitational force exerted on the system by the earth (equation is  $m a = f$– newton’s second law) where m is the hanging mass and f is the gravitational force exerted on the system), and the results were plotted.  (see figure 2 above for the plot.)

analysis of the plot revealed that as the hanging mass was increased (and the gravitational force exerted on the system increased as a result), the system’s acceleration increased in a nearly perfectly linear fashion, with very little error.  (the error bars on the plot are too small for the software to render at normal resolution, so they aren’t shown.)  the equivalency criterion of 2σ makes no difference to whether or not the results are statistically significant, as the errors are so small that doubling them still doesn’t make the error bars visible on the plot.  the experimental mathematical model was  with an r2 value of 0.9951, which indicates that the results are very nearly perfectly linear.  this is consistent with the theoretical mathematical model, $f = m a$, because as force is increased in a linear fashion and mass is held constant under this model, the acceleration must also increase in a linear fashion.

during the second lab period, the results obtained by the researchers were compared with results from other groups, whose data are shown below in figures 3 and 4.



	both of these groups, while they obtained different coefficients for x in their equations, concluded that the relationship between force exerted on a system and its acceleration is a linear one, which is consistent both with the theoretical model of $f=m a$ and with our group’s findings.

	in the case that more than one force acts on the system, the relationship will still be a linear one, assuming that neither force is changing in a manner other than linear.  the equation is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ - notice that both internal and external forces are accounted for, as force acting on the system may come from outside sources.  still, to adjust for other possible outside forces acting on the system – or for unexpected internal forces acting on the system, all that has to be done is to add a factor for the net external forces, as well as the net internal forces found to be acting on the system.  essentially, this multiple-force equation gives the relationship between the total net force acting on the system and the system’s acceleration.

	in the case that a string heavy enough that it can’t be considered massless is used, the mass of the string must simply be added to the total mass of the system.  however, because strings never have much mass to them, even the string’s mass could not be ignored, its actual effect on the acceleration of the system would be small.  for example, if the string in the experiment had a mass of 5g, that mass would have to be added to the total mass of the system, and in trial 8 of the experiment, the resultant acceleration would have been slightly lower, in the neighborhood of 1.76 instead of 1.79.

	possible random errors in the experiment are all due to human error, and could only occur during measurement of the masses of different objects in the system.  to reduce this error, the person measuring the masses using the scale used a pencil to adjust the weights, so that smaller, more precise adjustments could be made.  the greatest source of possible systematic error is imperfection in the “frictionless” track – because the cart still touches the track sometimes due to imperfections in its workmanship/natural wear and tear, the actual force of friction experienced by the cart during the experiment most likely was not zero.  additionally, the string is not in actuality massless, and neither is the pulley, but these two factors will have the exact same effect across all trials, as their masses do not change, and are so small that they were ignored during the experiment.  these systematic errors were accounted for automatically in the negative constant value present in the experimental mathematical model – this is roughly equivalent to the slowing effect that all the different sources of error would have, were they more accurately represented.

	the results of the experiment are constrained in that the model obtained is only valid for a single force acting on a system of constant mass in a frictionless situation.  obviously, the vast majority of situations encountered by moving objects in normal life are not frictionless, and many do not have constant mass, although the changes in mass will be very small.  (an example of this change in mass is a car’s exhaust – this is matter that is expelled from the system of the car during its operation, and because the system gives away a very small portion of its mass to the outside world, the system cannot technically be said to have constant mass.)  still, many of these situations can be modeled as ideal situations like the one that the experimental mathematical model describes, as long as appropriate measures are taken to account for the difference between the theoretical and the actual that reality imposes.

	the results of this experiment confirmed that acceleration increases in a linear fashion as the force operating on the system increases in the same fashion, and deepened the group’s understanding of the way that forces and systems interact in the world.  although no situation is ideal, most can be approximated by an ideal, and we can use equations that are true in ideal situations as approximations of the equations that are true in real-life situations, as we saw during the experiment.
