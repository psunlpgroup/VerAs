discussion and conclusion

	the purpose of this lab was to investigate how the acceleration of a system is affected when the applied force is changed. the experimental design set up is shown in figure 2, where the blue box represents the cart and the orange ball represents the hanging mass. the system mass stayed constant throughout the experiment, however mass was transferred during each trial from the cart to the end of the string, thus changing the applied force. the acceleration was then measured using datastudio and the data for this is shown in table 2. the value for applied force was found using newton’s second law, which relates force, acceleration, and mass. this equation, which is the theoretical model, is $f=ma$. since this force is in the vertical direction, the variable a is simply the acceleration of gravity. the mass used for each trial is displayed in table 3 and was found by multiplying the number of bobs transferred to the end of the string by the mass of one bob. after plugging in the mass and acceleration to find applied force (table 4) it was plotted on a graph to show the relationship between applied force and acceleration. graph 1 shows this relationship to be linear. error bars were added using the uncertainty values provided in datastudio but are too small to be seen. the experimental model was then determined, from the trendline, to be $a=4.873 f - 0.0077$ also shown in graph 1. data from two other groups are shown below is 


both groups used newton’s second law as their theoretical model and discovered that there is a linear relationship between the applied force and acceleration of a system, which supports our findings. another thing that we all had in common was the presence of another force. when comparing our experimental model of $a=4.873 f - 0.007$ to the theoretical model of $f=ma$, the second part of -.0077 makes it clear that there is another force acting on the system. since it is a negative value, the force was acting against the system. the groups pictured above both have a positive value, meaning the force acted in favor of the system, which is where our data differed. this deviation from the theoretical model could be a result of other forces including friction, air resistance, or a tilt pointed away from the pulley. the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model when solving for f, in which you would have to use the entire mass. a non-massless string will contribute to the acceleration because, even though it may have been weighed initially as a part of the system, it is still adding to the hanging mass which will increase the acceleration as the mass falls. if the string mass is negligible, then the only force acting on the system by the string is the force of tension, which can be ruled out since it is internal to the system. this makes the weight of the hanging mass the only net force. systematic errors included the calibration of the scale, differing bob weights, and the air pressure within the track. systematic errors can be resolved by ensuring that all equipment is properly calibrated and working correctly. random errors include human error that could be solved by doing more trials for each new hanging mass or using a machine to perform the experiment, taking out the human aspect entirely. the generalizability was limited during the experiment because there were not enough trials done to justify using the experimental model on a wider scale. the added force acting against this specific system also limits generalizability.
