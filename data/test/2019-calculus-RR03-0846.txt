discussion and conclusion:

the question that we researched was “what impacts the period of the pendulum?” we researched this by determining three independent variables that could be tested to determine if the period was impacted. these three independent variables were mass, angle, and string length. in the mass experiment, we were able to determine that the period of the pendulum was not affected by changing the mass. this is because the error bars that we could make overlapped due to the uncertainty of our weighing equipment. in the angle experiment, we were able to determine that the period of the pendulum was not affected by changing the angle. this is because the error bars that we were able to make overlapped due to the uncertainty of the tape measure. in the length experiment, we were able to determine that the period of the pendulum was increased when the length of the string was increased. the error bars when using the photogate were too small to be seen and did not overlap.

we were also able to go online and find the theoretical equation of the period of a pendulum. this equation is 		. our mathematical model did not support this equation as our 

best fit line was a polynomial function while the best fit line was meant to be a power curve. since we did not find the correct trendline, we can safely bet that some sort of errors was made during this experiment. some possible errors that could have occurred are the random errors of timing incorrectly with the stopwatches, applying some sort of downward force instead of dropping the weight could have caused a quickened period, and we could have also incorrectly read the tools that we used to measure each value. some systematic errors could include if a measuring device was incorrectly marked or if a stopwatch runs slowly or quickly. some ways to decrease these errors could be using a better time measuring device, as we did with the photogate, or removing the amount of human interference in general regarding the experiment. this could mean having a system in place that allows us to drop the weight without physically touching it ourselves. we could also perform more tests and use multiple measuring devices to reduce error.
