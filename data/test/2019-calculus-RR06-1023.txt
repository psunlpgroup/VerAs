discussion and conclusion

in the force and motion lab, we questioned what different factors would affect a system’s acceleration. in this case, we used a slide car on an air track. the factors that were tested in this experiment included adjusting the amount of hanging weight on the system, increasing the mass of the system as a whole, and increasing the force of kinetic friction on the system by adding magnets and observe if there were any trends with our collected data. 

for the first part of our experiment, the hanging weight was increased and decreased to collect meaningful data on how those changes influenced the system’s acceleration. we claimed that increasing the iv (hanging mass) will have a positive correlation to the dv (acceleration of the system). our data shown about proves that our prediction was accurate by exhibiting a positive linear relationship between hanging mass and acceleration. our data was quite precise, with an r2 value of 0.9998 and a clear representation showing that as the hanging mass increased, so did the acceleration almost systematically. next, we tested the weight of the overall system. here we claimed that increasing the mass of the system will have a negative correlation with the acceleration of the system simply due to the fact the air car will be heavier and will need more of a push to get the car in motion. again, our prediction was correct, and our graph shows a negative correlation between acceleration and system mass with an r2 value of 0.9781. moving into our second part of this lab, we were interested in discovering how acceleration will be affected when we increase or decrease the friction force on the system by changing the positioning of magnets on the cart. we predicted that the lower the iv (location of the magnets) on the cart, the higher the dv (acceleration of the system) will be. according to our data, not all of the points on the graph fall on our trend line. to our surprise, the frictional force between the track and the cart is only increased by a small amount, which is difficult to distinguish among the three graphs. the r^2 values can be utilized to support this claim of being fairly confident, as the r^2 values are .9732, .9572, and .9757. the closer the r^2 value is to 1, the higher the confidence of the trendline. with regards to the trendline and the r^2 values, it can be determined that we can be fairly confident on the trendlines, as they do show a correlation.

other group data- due to time restraints we did not have time to compare our findings to other groups in the first part of our data but we did have a chance to compare at the start of the second class period to discuss our results. we found that our data was fairly similar to the other groups around us. fortunately, we did ger to compare our results for the second portion of the experiment. 
*our group incorrectly created the wrong function type, as we created an exponential function, where instead we were supposed to create a linear function. we fixed it after the picture was taken, and so the finalized equations are linear. 
group #2’s data seems to support the findings of our group. although it is not exactly the same correlation that our group obtained, the data does point to a correlation that suggests that the placement of the magnets does have an impact on the acceleration of the cart. their data; however, proved to challenge our findings as there was no correlation between the placement of the magnets with the y-intercept. however, their magnitude of the slope did decrease as the magnets were places lower on the cart, suggesting that the placement did affect the acceleration of the system overall. the results from all the other group and ours were different; however, they seem to suggest that the placement of the magnets did affect the acceleration of the system. 
the applied force that was exerted on the system was the fan that caused the system, including the weights to accelerate along the track. we increased the friction force by adding weights on the top, middle and bottom of the system to see if there was any correlation between the magnets added and their position and acceleration. the formulas used were $a = \frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$.

other possible factors that have not been tested that may have an impact on the acceleration include gravitational force, and the air resistance of the air track. a higher force of gravity will have a proportional impact on the acceleration of the system, meaning as the force of gravity increases, the acceleration of the system also increases. the presence of air resistance on the air track could cause a decrease in the acceleration of the system, as air resistance opposes the system’s intended motion. they could be investigated by setting up experiments that have both the gravitational force and air resistance as independent variables. in a lab, varying levels of gravitational force can be achieved and the effect that it has on the acceleration on the system can be observed. the air resistance can also be investigated by creating an experimental set-up that enables the level of air resistance to be calculated.

to improve this experiment, we could have more trials to observe what would happen if we continued to add heavier weights to m2. this would also help reduce random error. reducing friction between the cart and the guide rail would produce more accurate results and reduce error. also, we could have more trials to observe what would happen if we continued to add heavier weights to m2. this would also help reduce random error. reducing friction between the cart and the guide rail would produce more accurate results and reduce error.
