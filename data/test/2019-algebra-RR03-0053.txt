discussion and conclusion 

a. the research question being asked in these labs was “what impacts the period of a pendulum?”.

b. to address this research question we used a serious of three labs and multiple experiments. in the first lab, lab001, we looked at multiple factors that could have an impact on the period of a pendulum including the mass of the pendulum, the angle from which the pendulum is dropped from and the length of the string that the pendulum is attached to. in lab 002 we found the standard deviation of the data and applied it to the data collected in lab 001 in the form of error bars. this was done to see if the positive or negative correlations observed in lab 001 were significant. we found that there was a correlation between two of the variables, the length of the string and the angle at which the pendulum is dropped from, had a correlation with the period of a pendulum. we found that the mass of the pendulum has no correlation with the period of the pendulum. in lab 003 the purpose was to determine what the exact mathematical relationship was between the period of the pendulum and the length of string. we found from figure 002 what the mathematical relationship was between the period of the pendulum and the length of string.

 we found that the length of the string and the period of the pendulum had a positive correlation as seen in figure 001. this was under conditions shown in table 001. we were able to see with the error bars applied from our standard deviation collected in lab002 in figure 001 that this was a true positive correlation between the length of the string and period of the pendulum. in lab003 we were able to see the exact type of positive correlation that the length of string and the period of the pendulum had in figure 2 under conditions mentioned in table 4 . this graph shows a positive power correlation between the length of string and the period of the pendulum. from this figure 2 we were able to see the exact mathematical relationship between the length of the string and the period of the pendulum. the length of the string does have an impact on the period of a pendulum. 



we found that the angle from which the pendulum was dropped from and the period of the pendulum had a positive correlation as seen in figure 3. this experiment was done under the conditions laid out in table 2. we were able to see with the error bars applied from our standard deviation collected in lab002 in figure 003 that this was a true positive correlation between the angle from which a pendulum is dropped and the period of a pendulum. the angle from which the pendulum is dropped does have an impact on the period of the pendulum. 

we found that the mass of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum do not have a correlation as seen in figure 4. this experiment was done under conditions laid out in table 3. we were able to see with the error bars applied in figure 4 that the lines of the error bars overlap so the uncertainty in our measurements lends itself towards no correlation between the mass of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum. the mass of the pendulum does not have an impact on the period of the pendulum. 

c. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum that $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. this is different from our mathematical model that we developed from our experiment in lab 003 shown in figure 2. the mathematical model we developed was $t=2.1269 l^{0.4111}$. they are both show a positive power correlation between the period of a pendulum and its length. overall the theoretical model and my groups model lines up very well in the beginning but as the length progresses out mathematical model tends to be more arched compared to the theoretical model. what this means that as the length increases our model will show less time per period as you approach infinity as compared to the theoretical model. now this model applies to the length of the string vs period of the pendulum and not the angle from which it is dropped which also has an affect on the period of the pendulum. the mathematical model also does not apply to the mass of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum because there is no correlation between the two.

d. errors that were present in this lab could include systematic errors that would include the stopwatches could have been calibrated to calculate for more or less time than a second for a second, the ruler used to measure the length of the string was not accurate, the scale used to calculate mass was not calibrated correctly, the angle of the protractor was not correct, the photogate could have been calibrated incorrectly.

	random errors that could have been present in this lab could have included the person holding the pendulum released it from a different angle, the two people taking time measurements could have judged a period differently, the two people taking time measurements could have had human error when recording time, the person who measured the length of the string did so inaccurately, the person who measured the mass of the pendulum did so inaccurately.

	to reduce random human error while timing the period of the pendulum in lab 003 we used a photogate which dropped our range of error from 0.0656 to 0.001 which is a major difference. we also had the same person drop the pendulum every time and use the protractor the same way every time to keep it consistent. to reduce human error when timing the period of the pendulum in lab 001 we had two people timing the period of the pendulum. 

	to reduce the error in this lab in the future i would suggest a machine that could drop the pendulum from the same angle every time to ensure the data collected is closer to true value, this also would eliminate human error when it comes to dropping the pendulum.
