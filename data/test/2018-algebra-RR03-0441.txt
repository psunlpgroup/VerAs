discussion and conclusion

	within this module, consisting of the three labs mentioned, the period of a small swing of a pendulum was measured as the variables of mass of bob, angle of release, and length of string were investigated and manipulated. these variables were manipulated in such a way to effectively isolate any confounding variables that could contribute to the presence or absence of a correlation. 

	the data provided in table 5 and figure 1 both defend the original prediction, in that as mass of the bob increases, the period of the pendulum would not change. in this experiment, five trials were completed with the mass of the bob starting at 50 grams, and increased by 20 grams after every trial was completed. the time it took for the pendulum to complete one period was not affected by the mass of the bob, as indicated by the lack of pattern displayed in figure 1. the overlapping error bars can also attest to the conclusion that there is no correlation between the two variables in a small swing setting. the initial hypothesis and predictions were supported by the data provided in the first lab, and in table 5 and figure 1.

	the data provided in table 6 and figure 2 did not defend the original prediction, in that as angle of release of the pendulum increases, the period of the pendulum would also increase. in this experiment, five trials were completed with the angle of release starting at 20, and reducing the number of degrees by 4 after each trial was completed. the time it took for the pendulum to complete one period was not affected by the angle of release, as indicated by the lack of pattern displayed in figure 2. this can be shown yet again by the overlapping error bars, which signify the absence of a relationship between the period of a small swing of the pendulum and the angle of release of the bob. 

	the data provided in table 7 and figure 3 supported the original prediction, in that as length of the string increases, the period of the pendulum would also increase. in this experiment, five trials were completed with length of string starting at 50 cm, and increased by 25 cm after every trial was completed. the time it took for the pendulum to complete one period was shown to be affected by the length of the string. as figure 3 clearly displays, the length of string and the period of the pendulum have a strong relationship. in the third lab, photogate was used as more accurate measuring tool to analyze the period of the pendulum. the data, as presented in table 9 and figure 4, again demonstrated a strong relationship between period of a pendulum and length of string. a curve of best fit was drawn on figure 4 using excel, and the curve that best fit the graph was a power curve. the equation and r^2 value are also displayed on the graph. the error bars on figures 3 and 4 are relatively small, and do not overlap with one another, which allows one to conclude that there is a relationship between length of string and period of the pendulum. 

	the experimental mathematical model for the period of the pendulum was shown to be a power equation, and the equation presented by excel was [0.2636x^0.4307]. this was based off of the data using photogate found in figure 4 and table 9, from the third lab. the experimental mathematical model can be compared to the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum which states that [$t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$]. the experimental mathematical model calculates slightly lesser values than when the data is inputted into the theoretical mathematical model. the models are both reliable when calculating for period of pendulum because they provide very similar answers, and both fit the curved trendline. additionally, the theoretical model only takes into account length of string as a non-constant, therefore it holds true that angle of release and mass would not affect the period. 

	there are many errors, both random and systemic, that could have possible skewed the data or resulted in less accurate results. some random errors that were possible included having odd reaction time when using the stopwatch, resulting in inaccurate results. another random error could be that the experimenter used the measuring instruments incorrectly or not the same each time. some systemic errors include an imbalance on the pendulum swing, an uneven table, or incorrect markings on the measuring tools by the manufacturer. random error could be reduced by ensuring that the same person makes all of the measurements so that there are no discrepancies between techniques. additionally, the person counting down for the experiment must be the same person who is using the stopwatch so there is a reduced reaction time. these would reduce random error and uneven data. systematic errors could be reduced by only using extremely reputable companies to get their measuring instruments, one which ensures correct markings on all of their devices. error could also be reduced for an imbalanced pendulum by making sure that the apparatus is set up properly. 

	a major constraint that impeded generalizability of the data set was time in lab. the time in lab only permitted five trials for each variable, and this is not enough to create a statistically significant conclusion. if a larger sample size was experimented upon, then the data could be generalized for larger swings and larger masses as well.
