conclusion:

the experiment was to find what affects the period of a pendulum. this was done by testing three different variables, angle of release, mass, and string length. experiment one was done with varying string lengths attached to the pendulum and a constant angle of release and mass. experiment two was done with varying angles of release and a constant mass and string length. experiment three was done with varying masses and a constant angle of release and string length. the only experiment to show a difference in the time of the period’s pendulum was experiment one, as shown in the data above the graph creates a power function with a r^2 value of .9962 meaning this curve fits the data extremely well. experiment two and three showed that angle of release and mass have no affect on the time of the pendulum’s period. the graphs from experiment two and three show a straight-line trend meaning the time of the pendulum’s period is not affected by those variables.

	the errors present in the experiment can be random or systematic. the random errors could have been the difference between the time lapses, improper placement of the protractor or even a slight bounce in the crossbeam holding the string in place. the systematic errors could be the center of gravity due to location or the friction between string and pivot point. these errors could be greatly reduced to a near perfect system if an automated timer/counter was in place as well as an automated release system.

	the experiment is limited having a maximum angle of release at 90 degrees due to the nature of the protractor. the experiment is also limited to a maximum weight that does not break the string.
