discussions and conclusions 



overall, the predictions that we made were mostly correct. the task was to find out if any of the three factors impacted the period of the pendulum. we claimed that the length and angle of the pendulum would affect the period and the mass would not. this is what happened according to the graphs above. the length of the pendulum had a 100 percent correlation with the length of its period. according to the graph above, this is shown because there is a clear positive slope between the two variables. the angle of release of the pendulum does affect the period length of the pendulum, but only after 20 degrees. before 20 degrees the angle seems to have no correlation to the period. this is also shown in the graphs above because there is a clear positive slope to the “angle vs period” graph. the mass at the end of the pendulum was the only factor that had no correlation at all to the period, as shown in the “mass vs period” graph. the graph of these two variables has a trend line that is horizontal, indicating that there is no slope. this graph also had the lowest r2 value of the  three. the error bars for the three graphs were very small, so we are very confident in how well the data supports our claims and addresses the research question.

the theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$. our mathematical model according to our data supports the theoretical model. our equation was $t=2.01 l+{0.497}$ . some random errors that we had were the human reaction time with the stopwatches and measurement of the the length of the string due to having to estimate the center of mass. we were able to reduce the amount of error regarding the measurement of time by using a photogate to measure instead of humans and stopwatches. we still took multiple trials to reduce other errors but were ultimately still constrained because there was still systematic errors (air resistance, measuring angle of release). the remaining errors make our results less generalizable, but they are taken into account with the inclusion of the error bars.
