conclusion:
	Experiments 4,5, and 6 were conducted to determine if: the velocity is impacted by physical lab features such as mass of a system, angle and friction and how they impact mathematical models created by our data. Our hypothesis for these experiments is that the mass does impact the overall velocity of the object in motion. We used discussion and our own data to predict that there is a direct correlation between the mas of the cart and the velocity of the system as a whole. Through these experiments, the mass of the system stayed constant, however the mass of the hanging force and cart were altered between each trial.  
	Experiment 4 was a challenge in which lab groups had to determine the correct distance in which the ball would fly through the hoop. Our first objective was to determine the height in which the ball would be released. This is the measurement from the apparatus to the ground. After measuring this base height, we were able to come up with a target distance, hoop distance, and determine the uncertainty of our values. 
	The experimental design for this lab included a metal ball, a hoop, and the ramp from which the ball was released. Using a photogate, we were able to determine the velocity in which the ball was rolling as it shot off of the ramp. After our initial trial of shooting the ball, multiple trials were preformed to observe the final position of the ball. The independent variables were determined to be the mass of the ball and the dependent variables were determined to be the velocity and the distance/ final position. For the challenge of getting the ball through the hoop, we were able to accurately determine the distance in which the hoop stood from the ramp. Our controls were the angle at which the ball was released as well as the height of the ramp from the floor. 
	Factors that could have impacted our experiment are is  miscalculations within finding the velocity within the photogate, releasing the ball from the same exact angle very trial, and random error such as the ball hitting the ring. 


	The 5th experiment we conducted was to test and develop a mathematical model to describe the behavior of the systems. We determined that the independent variable would be the hanging force of the system while the dependent variable would be the acceleration in this case. Our controls included the mass of the whole system which was measured to be .342 kg. Our hypothesis was that if the hanging force of the system is increased, then the acceleration of the system will also increase. 
	Our experimental design included 8 trials with a hanging force on the system with the values of 0.03924, 0.07848, 0.11772,0.15696, 0.1962, 0.23544, 0.27468, and 0.31392 newtons. According to Newton’s Second Law, $a = \frac{f}{m}$. Because force and mass are not inversely related in this equation, the two variables are proportional to one another. From this mathematical relationship, we can establish that as the force increases, so will the acceleration. This is also true in our experimental model. We had a positive slope in our experimental model which also represents a positive correlation between the force and the acceleration of the system. As the hanging force increased, so did the acceleration of the system. According to Newton’s Second Law, mass and acceleration are inversely related. From this mathematical relationship, we can establish that as the mass increases, the acceleration of the system will decrease. This is also true in our experimental model. We ended up getting a negative slope in our curve which represents a negative correlation between mass and acceleration. We were confident in our measurements since the uncertainty was at a rather low number for each set we took. If we did have a high certainty number, we would redo the trial for a more accurate measurement for our experiment. Our uncertainty ranged from .0014 to .041 which are relatively small numbers. If the uncertainty was above .05, we would reconduct the experiment.
	The first mathematical model was determined by using the theoretical model $f=m a$. From this model we were able to determine the acceleration in which the car traveled with a specific mass. In excel, the first mathematical model was found to be liner which showed a positive correlation. The second mathematical model was also found with the same equation $f=m a$. However, with the data collected, this model showed a negative curve as we were able to find our model to be the graph is 1/x. In our experiment, we would have most likely weighed each of the bobbles to make sure they all weighed the same rather than assuming they all weighed the same. Another way to better our results was to have an immediate time to when we released the cart and when we clicked for our results on the DataStudio. We are 70% confident of our results from the lab. Our R^2 was .7385 which is close to 1 leading our answer to be a better regression than if it was closer to 0.

For the 6th experiment our objective was to design and conduct an experiment to determine how physical objects can impact mathematical models. Our question of “How does the hanging force impact the acceleration of the system?” is what we tested in week 6. Our dependent variable was determined to be the acceleration of the system as a whole while the independent variable was determined to be the hanging force. Our prediction was that the hanging force will have an impact on the acceleration of the system. 
Our experimental design included the cart from lab 5 as well as the same apparatus. However, our design included a backwards tilt which we believe would impact the velocity of the system as a whole. We tested this by adding mass to the hanging force while adjusting the tilt angle to .25 inches, .5 inches, and to .75 inches. Our prediction stated that there should be an inverse correlation between the acceleration of the cart and the tilt of the ramp. As the tilt increased, the acceleration increased. Our C2 value will indicate the relationship of the tilt and the acceleration of the system. We determined that when the hanging force is decreasing, the acceleration will also decrease. The y-value represents the acceleration (dependent variable) of the system. The x-value (independent variable) represents the hanging force. As hanging force increases, the acceleration of the system also increases. This represents a positive correlation between the hanging force and the acceleration of the system. The physical feature of the lab setting in lab 05 represents a system without conflicting errors. The kinetic friction and the angle of incline 
As we compared to other groups with different variable, we feel confident with our hypothesis and conclusion because the downward slope did not have an effect on our acceleration based on our data. C2 represents the total hanging force. The total force on the system beyond the applied force from the hanging mass is 0.0675N. This value is pretty close to the values we found for the applied force on the cart. Our C2 values were 0.0741, 0.0985, and 0.0659. The total force found, 0.0675, is very close to this value. Possible factors that could have impacted any lab include friction. Like our previous lab, possible factors could’ve been air resistance or clogged holes in the ramp. We could’ve done more experimental things to help assure that all of our equipment was working properly
	These three labs helped us to determine how mathematical models can be impacted by physical in lab variables such as mass, acceleration, and angle. Using the Y value to show the acceleration which was determined to be our dependent variable, the x value which was determined to be the independent variable represented the hanging force. The kinetic friction and the angle of incline was kept constant. This allowed us to establish an accurate conclusion of the relationship between the force and acceleration in a system. Discussing with other groups on the different labs, lead us to believe that our hypothesis and prediction were correct in that overall variables such as mass, angle, and friction all have a role in determining the mathematical models within the experiments and alter the acceleration of a system. This is shown in figure 3.8.
