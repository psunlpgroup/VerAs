discussion and conclusion

		the purpose of this lab was to find a relationship between forces on a system and the resultant acceleration. for the first two experiments the goal was to find a mathematical model for mas versus acceleration. and for the last experiment the goal was to see how introducing other forces would impact that model.  as discovered in lab 5 with the first two experiments, it was determined that the error bars on all the graphs are too small to be seen so they were treated as negligible for all three experiments. however, considering that we averaged the masses of the fishing bobs, there is defiantly systematic error seeing as how the reported masses are more than likely not entirely accurate.

		in addition to the inaccurate masses, the potency and mass of the magnets used are unknown. this causes the generalization and replicability of the experiment would be difficult. the properties of the air track are also unknown, therefore the only way to be sure to get the same results are buy using the exact same air track and the same masses, this also largely limits the generalizability. these mathematical models also neglect the friction within the pully used to conduct the experiments, further limiting replicability.

		the mathematical models generated form this experiment is consistent with newtonâ€™s second law, $f = m_{system} a$. even though the equation is a function of acceleration in terms of weight force, it can be rearranged to be a function of weight force in terms of acceleration the slope would be inverted but it is a linear regression all the same.
