discussion and conclusion: 

the original research question was as stated, what impacts the period of a pendulum swing? the mass of the pendulum did not affect the period of the swing. the mass is proportional to the force in occurrence with a swing. as seen by the data points in the graph and the values shown in table 1, the time for a complete swing is scattered relative to a changing mass (50-250g). the error bars incorporated relay the uncertainty reported in the measurements. the data points seem to fall within one standard deviation from another as a trend line is able to connect the data points within the error bars. the conclusion from this signify that the mass did not affect the time of the period. mass was the only factor not tested with photogate (as directed during the experiment) so its error of uncertainty was also bigger.

 the length of the string of the pendulum did influence the period of the swing. the graph shows a linear trend upward, where the time to complete a swing increased with the length of the string. the data points convey this and in correlation to the error bars, fall within standard deviation of one. the data suggests an accurate goodness of fit for the function that describes the results. 

the angle of release did not seem to significantly influence the period of the swing. this was again quite hard to visually witness with the given graph represented in the data set. conceptually, the greater the amplitude the more distance the pendulum would need to cover, but the faster it would go. the smaller the amplitude, the less distance it would cover and the slower it would go. table 2 shows a minor correlation with time increasing as angle size increased.

the relationship between period and pendulum length is supported by the mathematical model as shown    the mass of the bob should not have an effect on the period of the pendulum. while any mass may be used, while increasing the string length, the relative time proportionally will also increase. angle, like mass, is also not represented in the mathematical equation, and so one can conclude that length appears to have the only significant effect on the time. this is also represented by the curve fit in the three data graphs. where graph 2 shows an only significant positive trend. 

in relation to errors seen in the experiment, some data points may have been subject to random error as the precision in points may have lacked from reaction timing. all such points may not have been incorporated in the final data taken. systematic errors could include the stopwatch. if it was an older device, it may have induced systematic errors in measurements as results are dilated with the stopwatch. similarly, if the string had been previously used and stretched out, it would also have caused measurements to be off. to combat random error, more trails could be run to collect a larger amount of data and averaging this number could allow for a more accurate and precise record. utilizing newer equipment could also reduce systematic error as a method to eliminate variances from tools used within the experiment. certain constraints were seen such as angle of release being no larger than 45 degrees to our apparatus as well as the complete length of the string (correlating to apparatus and floor level). these factors may have caused a generalization in our lab record and formulated only a small measurable amount as without constraints which would have allowed for larger collection of data and most likely an increased spread in interpretation.
