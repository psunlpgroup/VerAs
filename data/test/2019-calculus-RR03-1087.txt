conclusion:
We first asked: “Which factors affect the period of a pendulums swing?” and after 3 labs, we can say that length of string is the only factor that has a significant effect on the period of the pendulum. In the first experiment we conducted three individual experiments to test length of string, mass, and angle of release, to determine if any influenced the pendulum. In lab 02, we learned how to calculate uncertainty to create confidence in our data or show us we needed to reevaluate our hypothesis and prediction. After lab 02, we knew that our original claim that mass would affect the pendulum was false. So, we revised it for lab 03. We ran into a few errors during the experimentation process. In the beginning we were using stopwatches, introducing quite a bit of human error. Our times were inconsistent and had to be averaged. Then, we started using software and more advanced tools that could measure the pendulum of the swing more accurately. Once this happened, the data became more clear and conclusions were easier to create. Although the data fits our model, we cannot generalize our results. Our range of measurement for the length of the string was only 1.2 m, and it would be foolish to assert our conclusions on the population distribution of pendulum swings vs string length.
