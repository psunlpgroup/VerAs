discussion and conclusion

the purpose of these labs was to generate mathematical models that represent the relationship between acceleration and an independent variable that is related to newton’s second law. in lab 05, we were tasked to find the relationship in a motion system that shows newton’s second law. in lab 06, we build off of this topic by adding slight changes to the motion system in order to deepen our understanding of the model.

for the acceleration vs. force graph in lab 05,  we started by having all of the bobbers off the cart and in the back of the pully system. we would then launch the cart on the track and record its velocity on a velocity vs. time graph. from there, we would measure the slope to get the acceleration. then we would calculate the force by multiplying the acceleration by the mass. we would repeat this process by adding the bobber onto the cart. at the end of the experiment, we found that there is a positive, linear correlation between force and acceleration. our model has an equation of $y=2.8718 x - 0.021$ with an r^2 value of 0.9998. this means that as acceleration increases, the force will increase as well.

for the acceleration vs. mass graph in lab 05, we started by having one weight on the cart and measuring the velocity and calculating the acceleration like in the previous experiment. we would repeat the process with the additional weights that we had. our model resulted in an equation of $y=0.987 - 1.5399 x$ with an r^2 value of 0.9927. this shows that there is a linear relationship between mass and acceleration and that there is a negative correlation between the two values. as mass increases, the acceleration will decrease, and as the mass decreases, the acceleration will increase.
to obtain the graphs in lab 06, we would repeat the process of the acceleration vs. force experiment, except we would add tilt to the system for each bobber. this gave us five graphs to analyze and compare to our experiment in lab 05. our equations don’t differ too much from the ones that we got in the previous experiments. for example the highest slope value is from when the tilt was 0.006m with an equation of $y=2.9381 x - 0.0811$ and the lowest slope value is from a height of 0.0024m with an equation of $y=2.7724 x - 0.1469$. our graphs also have high r-squared values too, which further support our data. we also found that as the height increased the maximum acceleration value would decrease.

both groups measured how friction would affect acceleration. their data is accurate because they have relatively high r^2 values. it appears that they found that as the friction increased, the acceleration would decrease. this helps us find what the variables mean in the equations. the y value is acceleration and the x value is the force. each of the different graphs show how the independent variable tested affects the acceleration of a system.
our error appears to not be too large impact our data significantly. this is shown by how the error bars on the graphs are small, and how the r^2 values are close to one. the systematic error would be attributed to error in measurements. for the program that calculated the velocity vs. time graph, it also gave us the acceleration, along with an error value. this error value could be added or subtracted from our acceleration, and could increase or decrease our acceleration and slope of our graphs. for measuring the mass with the balance, there could be error with the balance which would cause our mass to increase or decrease, as well as our force calculations to decrease or increase depending on what happens to the mass. these errors could be removed by possibly recalibrating the program (if that is a function), or using multiple balances, like an analytical balance, to weigh the bobbers.
the random error could be caused by reaction time on our end. for the cart set up, we could possible have started early or late when flipping the switch to turn the air on that would have skewed our acceleration data. we also could have not selected all of the data points in the velocity vs. time graph to get a proper acceleration. this would also affect our acceleration and further calculations involving acceleration. the errors involving acceleration could have been avoided if we did addition trials and averaged each one to get a more accurate answer. another random error is that we could have accidentally added weight to the bobbers and/or the weights that increased the tilt. this could have been done by adding fingerprints or smudges that would increase the weight slightly. this could be avoided by cleaning the bobbers and weights before and after weighing them, and using gloves or something that wouldn’t add weight to the objects to transport them.
there were some constraints involving these experiments. time was one of our biggest constraints. we could have gotten more trials if we had additional time to repeat the experiment, so that way we could average the data and have more accurate data. the lab setting was also a constraint. our area of operation was not too open, so we would have to maneuver around table in order to conduct the experiment. we were also limited by out tools that we could use. there wasn’t a measuring tool that would measure the force, and the program that measured the acceleration would measure the velocity and we would have to calculate the force. an analytical balance also would have been better to use in this situation for measuring the mass because we would be able to recalibrate the balance to get a number that is more accurate.
our two mathematical models are consistent with newton’s second law. the law states that the sum of forces is equal to the mass of the system multiplied by the acceleration. for the force vs. acceleration experiment, we found that there was a positive, linear relationship, meaning that as the force would increase, the acceleration would increase as well. this makes sense because the equation from newton’s second law is $f = m a$, and so if the acceleration increased in the equation and the mass remained constant, then the force would increase as a result of this. our other model involving mass vs. acceleration resulted in a negative linear relationship. this, again, makes sense to the equation being $f = m a$. if you were to keep the force constant and increase the mass, then the acceleration would have to decrease in order to keep the force consistent. both are linear relationships because the equation $f = m a$ is a linear function with no powers of exponential functions in it.
