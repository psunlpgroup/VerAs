discussion and conclusion



the goal of this experiment was to determine and compare the experimental relationship between an applied force and the acceleration of a system. the applied force to the system was calculated using a hanging weight and the acceleration of the system was measured using datastudio. no additional weight was added to the system, the bobs that were attached to the cart were just transferred from the cart to the end of the string. using the track and the air system, we were able to eliminate most friction and allow the cart and hanging weight to behave in a frictionless environment. figure 2 shows the experimental relationship between the applied force (hanging weight) and the acceleration of the cart in this environment. the uncertainty and error bars in figure 1 and 2 were used to determine that each point was significantly different from the next using the equivalency criterion. the trendline on figure 2 also showed that the applied force and acceleration had a very strong, positive, linear relationship as one would expect. 

in figure 3, the data and results that were presented by group 1 are shown. their theoretical model is similar to the one calculated in this report in that they are both linear, however, they have a negative y-intercept and a much smaller slope. in their data table, it is shown that they did not convert the mass of the system or hanging mass from grams to kilograms which will give them a much higher hanging weight and applied force. this miscalculation can easily account for the difference in the slopes. the theoretical model shows that the y-intercept should be zero, so there must be some error that is unaccounted for 

the next figure, figure 4, shows the data and results from group 5. they also show a positive, linear relationship between the applied force and the acceleration of the system and a negative y-intercept. their data table also show that they failed to convert the hanging mass from grams to kilograms which resulted in the large hanging weight/applied force and very small slope compared to our calculations. considering they also have a negative y-intercept, there must be some error in their system that isn’t accounted for as well. both of the sets data and results from the other groups, although are different in numerical values (due to a failure to convert units), both show the positive, linear relationship that is shown in this lab reports results and what is expected theoretically. both of these “errors” in the equations can most likely be attributed to a friction force present in the way of wind resistance. the friction between the cart and the surface is reduced to almost zero but, there is no way to completely reduce the wind resistance without placing the system in a vacuum. 

the theoretical model that relates acceleration to a single applied force is  where  is an applied force,  is the mass of the system, and  is the acceleration. when manipulated, the equation can be set to calculate acceleration as . our experimental model was calculated as . the theoretical model gives us a directly proportionate relationship while the experimental, while linear, has a y-intercept other than 0. these differ because there are some errors, possibly both random and systematic, that are not accounted for. the other difference is that the theoretical model has the applied force divided by some constant rather than multiplied like the experimental. 

the enhanced theoretical model relating the acceleration of the system to more than one force is . when manipulated it is the equivalent to . when compared to the experimental model, they still both give directly proportional relationships, however, the forces are still being divided in the theoretical model by a constant rather than being multiplied in the experimental. 

if a heavy string is used to connect the hanging weight with the cart, the mass of the system would increase by the mass of the string. therefore, the model would change from  to  where  is the hanging mass and is the mass of the string. this would decrease the acceleration of the system. 

errors are possible in the taking of all measurements including the mass of the system, the acceleration of the cart, and the velocity of the ball being launched horizontally from the table. the random error associated with the mass of the system can be reduced by taking multiple measurements and calculating the average and the same can be done for the velocity of the ball be launched horizontally from the table. error is also present in the experimental model relating acceleration to an applied force as wind resistance. the theoretical model will differ from the experimental because the theoretical model does not take any friction into account. there is no way the experimental model would be exactly the same unless the system were placed in a vacuum where there was no friction. 

a major constraint in this experiment would be time. there is little time for the students to take multiple measurements and to take extra care in being accurate for all measurements. also, the fact that there is no way to put the system in a vacuum to account for the friction that would be present for the experiment is also a constraint. our scale is also a constraint that would affect the generalizability of the results. the scale only goes to 610 g and would mean the mathematical model could only be generalized to system masses within 610 g, experiments done within the same time frame, and done outside of a vacuum.
