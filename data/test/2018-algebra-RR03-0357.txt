conclusion:

	we conducted an experiment that tested in small swings, what factor would impact the pendulum’s period and the mathematical relationship between the independent and dependent variable. possible factors included the length of the string, mass of the weight attached to the string, and the angle of release of the string. after collecting data of our trials regarding length of string vs. time in table 5, we graphed the points as shown in figure 1. the slope was calculated to be 0.0276 with an r^2 value to be 0.607. with an r^2 value closer to one, it indicates that the relationship between length of string and period is significant allowing it to be determined that the length of the string impacts the pendulum’s period, in that as the length of the string increased, the period was longer, supporting our hypothesis. after collecting data of our trials regarding mass of the weight on the string vs. time from table 6, a graph was created as shown in figure 2. the slope was calculated to be -6e-05 with an r^2 value to be 0.0152. with an r^2 value close to zero, it indicates that the relationship between the mass of the weight on the string with the period is not significant. furthermore, showing that the mass of the weight does not influence the period, refuting our hypothesis that increasing mass would shorten the period.  after collecting data of our trials regarding mass of the weight on the string vs. time as shown in table 7, a graph was created as shown in figure 3. the slope was calculated to be 0.0004 with an r^2 value to be 0.2. with an r^2 value closer to zero, it indicates that the relationship between the angle of release of the string with the period is not significant. furthermore, showing that the angle of release does not influence the period, refuting our hypothesis that increasing the angle would increase the period. however, the r^2 value is higher than it is in the factor 2 trial regarding mass, showing that angle of release has more of an effect on the period than mass. after discovering the factor that impacted the period of the pendulum was the length, we wanted to create a mathematical model for the period of the pendulum. since the mass of the weight on the string, and the angle of releases did not impact the period of the pendulum, those factors were not included in the mathematical model.  after running the experiment length vs. time with a photogate, we collected the results in table 8 and graphed the points onto figure 4. the line of best fit for this graph was a polynomial. our equation was $t=- 0.0003 l^{2} + 0.0489 l + 0.562$ where p indicates period and l indicates length. our r^2 value from this equation was 1. the theoretical mathematical model is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. our experimental data was significantly larger than the theoretical value. the differences in our experiment compared to the theoretical value could be due to systematic or random error. systematic error could occur by the scale or photogate being incorrectly calibrated. systematic error could also occur by the tape measure being stretched out resulting in incorrect measurements, or from the person consistently taking incorrect measurements using the tape measure or stopwatch. these errors could be reduced by calibrating the photogate and scale, and by taking more measurements to be more precise. constraints in the experiment involve the length of the string that could be tested, and mass of the weight. the pendulum was only so large and could not attach a string that was longer to the pendulum, or it would not been able to swing and record the period. the weight was constrained because we were only given a certain amount of weights. also, if the weight was too extreme it could have broken the string, not allowing for the string to swing and record the period.
