discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of this lab was to be able to develop mathematical models for a real system. the system for this lab was that of a cart being pulled by a hanging mass across a frictionless path and by redistributing the mass of the system, our group was able to come up with a mathematical model that could predict the acceleration of the cart with a varying mass against a varying hanging mass. the second part of the lab was done in order to understand the affect that tilt had on the system. so by increasing the tilt of the system, we tested the acceleration of the cart.

for part 1 of lab 05 our experiment of redistributing the mass of the system allowed us to determine the change of velocity of the cart in a fixed system. this was done by starting with a small hanging mass and large cart mass, after each test, we would move a part of the carts mass to the hanging mass, but not change the total mass of the system. this allowed us to derive a linear mathematical model that, with the assumption of total mass being unaffected, could predict the acceleration of the cart with specific mass. for the second part of lab 05, we followed the same strategy but kept the hanging mass constant. by adding mass to the cart (and the overall system) we derived a power equation that could determine the acceleration of the cart based on mass that has been added to the cart. finally for lab 06, we used the same strategy for this as we did for part 1 of lab 05 but increased the forward tilt of the system to determine if this affected the acceleration of the cart. from our data we saw that the slopes of the acceleration due to mass were the same but for each larger tilt value, the y-intercept would increase. this lets us know that by tilting the system, the coefficient of the mass does not change but does increase by a certain value depending on the magnitude of the tilt.

for group 3, they shared the same testable hypothesis for lab 06 and from the values they have displayed, it seems to reflect similarly to the models that we had for our forward tilt tests. with ~2.8 being the coefficient that is multiplied by the mass and the y-intercept increasing as the tilt is increased. for group 2, using friction as the independent variable and acceleration as the dependent variable, their data shows similar properties to my group. with a seemingly constant slope of acceleration the only change was the b value in their $y=m x+b$ style equation. it looks like as they increased friction, the acceleration decreased, which matches our groups conclusion because it would be similar to decreasing the lift of the track. 

some errors that could have affected our results are the random human error of the measurement of the lift. we determined the height of the lift by use of a yard stick, so by human judgement, the lift height could have been skewed slightly. this human error could have been fixed by using a measurement tool such as a caliper or more precise measurement tool. second, systematic error that could have occurred during our labs was that the track was not perfectly parallel with the ground, which affected the angle at which the ramp was launched, possibly resulting in values that were all shifted plus or minus some degrees. this is a more difficult systematic error to fix, but would have been fixed by using a level and checking to make sure that the track was indeed consistently level.

constraints that limit our results would be the time frame in which we were given for this experiment. by allowing more time for each experiment our group could have tested each hypothesis multiple times and concluded a more precise mathematical model.

our first experimental model, $a = 2.6742 m g + 0.0816$ relates to newtons second law because as mass 2 decreases, the acceleration of the cart decreases, and likewise for mass 2 increasing, the acceleration of the cart increases.

for our second experimental model, $a = 0.1314 m1 ^{0.676}$, the connections to newtons second law is that the coefficient and root of the mass are equal to the force due to the equation $f = m a$.
