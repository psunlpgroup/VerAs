conclusion

in this lab we looked in depth to how the period of a pendulum of small swings would be affected by changed different variables. for this experiment we changed the weight of the string, the length of the string, and the angle used for the string.

the three experiments helped answer the research question because they thoroughly tested different weights, angles, and lengths of the string to give us reliable data. by looking at the data above you can see from figure is  3 that the angle had very little impact on the period and what little affect that it did have was because we were using larger swings rather than small ones as angle with small swings would have no effect. as for the weight of the there was a slight change as seen in table is  2, as weight was increased by 149g the time dropped by .13s however, this change can be contributed to human error. the length of the string did have an affect on the period of pendulum as seen by figure is  1 as length is increased so is the period.

the theoretical mathematical model for a period of a pendulum states that weight will have no affect on a pendulum while length will and angle (only on large swings). as seen by the curve fitting the equation       $y=x^{2}$        fits the graphs the best this shows itâ€™s a parabolic fit and changes as such.

there are several errors that could have thrown off the data in this experiment. one big random error was the human error involved in using the stopwatches to record the time of the period. to reduce this, we used a laser timer in experiment 3 that took this problem out of the experiment. a systematic error that may have been present during the experiment would be how accurate the scale was, if the scale was off by only a little it would have thrown off all the data by a consistent amount. to fix this problem we could zero the scale and ensure we are using reliable scales by weighing the same weight with several different scales to make sure the same value is obtained. finally, another random error could have been the force that the pendulum was released at, releasing the pendulum with extra force would have a significant effect on the data. to reduce this, we could create a devise that would release it with the same angle/force every time to take out the possible random error by humans.

constraints in this experiment is time. if we had more time to work on the experiment, we could be more precise and obtain more data to be able to say with more certainty that our data is correct. another constraint to the experiment is the resources we had available to use. we only had what was available in the classroom and so if there was something we wanted to differently that required other resources we would not be able to do it.
