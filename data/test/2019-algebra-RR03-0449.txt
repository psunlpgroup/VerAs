discussion and conclusion 

what factors impact the period of a pendulum? 

the first the factor that was tested was mass of the pendulum. the prediction was that the heavier the mass the quicker the period of the pendulum. the mass was measured in grams with a range from 50 g to 210 g. data was collected by using stopwatches to record the time of a full complete swing. once the data was collected in excel, the standard deviation was calculated to be 0.131453, then a graph was able to be made. the graph showed that there was not a positive correlation between time and the weight. error bars were added to the graph to measure the uncertainty of the measurements. the error bars are small because the standard deviation is small since the time values are so close together. after gathering and interpreting the data it was seen that the prediction was incorrect.  



the second factor that was tested was the angle at which the pendulum was dropped. the angle was measured in degrees and ranged from 10 degrees to 50 degrees. the initial prediction was that the larger the angle, the longer the period would be. after collecting and interpreting the data is was seen that this was completely opposite. the data was again collected by using a stopwatch and the angle was measured by using a protractor. while observing the data, it was found that the biggest difference in the period of the pendulum was from the 10 degree and 20-degree measurements. the higher the angle, the less time difference we saw. during the experiment random error occur which skewed the data, but the error bars on the graph caught the uncertainty in the measurements. the graph displaying the data, observes to the change in the angles less than 25 degrees but does not show a large distance for angle higher than 25 degrees. therefore, the angle released did not impact the period once the angle was greater than 25 degrees. 



the third factor that was tested was the length of the string that the pendulum is attached too. this was measured by a measuring tape in millimeters and using a stopwatch to measure the time in seconds. the prediction for this experiment was that the longer the string length, the longer the period of the pendulum. once the data was collected and plotted on the graph, it was clear that there was a positive correlation between the time and the length of the string. error bars were then added to the graph which allows us to see the uncertainty in our measurements.  this experiment was repeated with a higher power sensor to collect the data. the photogate was used to eliminate random error during the experiment, which did increase the accuracy of our data. the data was collected through the photogate then uploaded to excel where the graph was made. this graph differed from the first graph because the second graph was a power-curve trend. when error bars were put into the second graph, they were barely noticeable which shows the certainty of the measurements obtained. from these two experiments it was concluded that the prediction was correct, that the longer the string length, the longer the period of the pendulum. 

when we repeated the experiment, using the photogate the data that was collected was very accurate. the data was then graphed using excel and error bars were put into the graph. the error bars were very small because of the accuracy of the data. along with error bars, a best fit line was added to the graph to show the trend in the curve. the best fit line almost aligned perfectly to the original graph curve. once the graph had all the components it needed the formula of the curve was obtained to be $t=0.92186336 l$. the theoretical formula for the period of a pendulum is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ when calculated out, the equation is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ which is very close to the formula we have. the graph gave us an r squared-value was obtained at a value of 0.9999. this r squared-value is near the value of 1, which indicates that the excel formulated equation is a nearly perfect fit to the trendline that passes through our observed data points. this verifies that the period of the pendulum is almost identical to a power-curve-relationship. 



the other experiments that were conducted did not support their predictions that the independent variable affected the dependent variable. looking at the first independent variable, the mass of the pendulum, it was shown that a best fit line was only able to go through two out of five data points. this gave the evidence that there is no correlation between the mass of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum. the other independent variable, the angle at which the pendulum was dropped also observed a weak correlation. the error bars on the graph measuring the angel and time overlapped each other, so the true value is within that range. after observing the data, we can eliminate these independent variables from the new experiment. 



during the experiments random errors came up, mostly during the measurement portions. the timing on the pendulum could have be corrected by using more than two people to measure the time. if more people measured the time, an average could be calculated which would be closer to the true-value. the last experiment allowed us to use a photogate which eliminated the human error of measuring time using a stopwatch. when comparing the two length of string experiments it can be observed how much human error occurred in the first experiment and how little was occurred in the second. another random error that occurred was during the measurement of the angle of the pendulum. this was measured by using a protractor, then dropping the pendulum from this measurement. when setting up the experiment it is possible that the pendulum could have moved from its measured released angle position. to eliminate this having a certain spot that releases the pendulum when a button is clicked. when this experiment is repeated it may be beneficial to use this technique when releasing the pendulum. another way an error can be reduced is that ever time we change the weight on the pendulum we can remeasure the length of the string. by reducing the errors in the experiment, the most accurate and precise the data can be.  

one constraint that limited our results was that the string holding apparatus only went up to a certain height. if it was higher, then we could have had a much longer string that depicted a wider range of results. another constraint could be the amount of time we had. if there was more time to measure more string lengths, then the data would be larger and we would be able to see how the trendline passes through more points.
