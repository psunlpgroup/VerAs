discussion and conclusion: 
   what truly impacts the period of a pendulum? 

throughout the three weeks that we spent conducting experiments, we were able to find the answer to this question. during the first experiment we identified the three independent variables that we thought could possibly affect the period of a pendulum. our group and the class came to a consensus that we would focus on the length of the string, hanging mass, and the angle of release. we tested these three independent variables by taking five trials at all different variations of each variable. with this we were able to find how each affected the dependent variable, time.  before taking the data 3 experimental design tables were created for each independent variable. these tables can be found under table 1, table 3, and table 5. while the experiment was conducted, the data found was stored into tables that can be found under table 2, table 4, and table 6. using the data found in each one of those tables, a graph was created for each one of the variables tested.  these graphs can be found under figure 1, figure 2, and figure 3. doing this experiment addressed the research question by allowing the data to show which variables directly affect the period of the pendulum. from the first experiment, it was found that two of the graphs, figure 1 and figure 3, both had straight lines which meant that there is little to no correlation between the independent variable affecting the dependent variable. with figure 2, which addresses the length of the string as the independent variable, the graph shows that as the string increases, so does the period. as the independent variables changed, the time increased or decreased accordingly. through the second part of the experiment we focused on uncertainties. since there are no set uncertainties for any of the equipment used, the standard deviation was calculated to be used. the error bars were placed in figure 4, figure 5, and figure 6 using this standard deviation. the higher number of standard deviations used, means the more data that is included in the uncertainties. from the second experiment we found that we can be confident in our data because all the error bars line up closely. if we were to increase the standard deviation, we could be more confident. we found that the period of the pendulum is affected by the length of the string. in the third part of the experiment we created a mathematical model and created the experiment again using a photogate. this was done to increase the accuracy of the time and make the data more reliable. the data for this experiment can be found in table 8 and was used for creating the graph found in figure 7. from this we were able to find the period of the pendulum is indeed affected by the length of the string. we decided that a power cure best fit our data and from this a mathematical model was created. our r^2 value was 0.9997 which is extremely close to 1 and shows that the data best fits a power curve. this data was taken under the condition that the string was let go at close to or under 20 degrees at each trial. the mathematical model found was $t=1.9961 l^{0.5045}$ where t is the period and l is the length of the string.  

the mathematical model created was stated in the line directly above. this was created by the graph found in figure 7. this equation is the equation of the power curve that best fit out data. the other groups had found an equation very similar to ours with a slight difference due to experimental error. the data that we collected fits this model very closely and this can be shown by the r^2 value being very close to 1. figure 7 shows the relationship of the independent variable to the dependent variable and allows us to better see that relationship. in this graph you can see a definite curve present. compared to figure 1 and figure 2, it can be seen that the correlations are not the same. these two graphs are almost linear, which shows no direct effect of the independent variable on the dependent.

through the experiment there were multiple errors that could have been present. these errors were both random and systematic. random errors include misreading the measurement, misaligned protractor, accidental application of force, and mistimed stopwatch. the systematic errors were a little less present, these include having a delayed stopwatch and the masses being inaccurate. the random errors could be reduced by taking multiple measurements of each set trial and taking the average of those multiples. this will help get a more exact value. reducing the systematic error could be done by accounting for the error of the tool when taking data. this describes our uncertainties and error bars.

during the experiment we were limited in some ways that generalized our data. one of these constraints was the fact that we could only test the length of string up to a certain distance. the highest length that we tested was in table 8 and was 3.35 meters. this keeps our data only to this point and we do not know about data above that length. the other constraint is the uncertainty of the photogate. the uncertainty is very small at plus or minus 0.001 seconds, but our data can never be completely accurate. this is not a huge deal because we know the uncertainty and can account for it. another constraint is amount of hanging mass that we could test. we found that the mass did not affect the period, but only having the amount of weight that we did means that we could only test up to that weight and no more.
