conclusion:
the main focus of the lab sessions for the past 3 weeks has been on assessing the research question is  what affects the period of a pendulum?



 the first experiment addressed the research question by testing if angle at release affected the time it took for the pendulum to do one complete swing. our initial prediction was that as the angle increased, so would the period. however, this turned out to not be the case as our results indicated that the angle at release did not cause much alteration on period. our scatterplot graph depicted points that were linear but had no slope. through further uncertainty testing and by displaying 1*sigma error bars, we were able to claim that angle at release has no effect on period so long that the angle is less than  from vertical.

 the second experiment addressed the research question by testing if the mass at the end of the pendulum affected the time it took for the pendulum to do one complete swing. our initial prediction was that as the mass increased, the period would decrease in length. however, this turned out to not be the case as our results indicated that the mass did not cause much alteration on period. our scatterplot graph depicted points that were linear but had no slope. through further uncertainty testing and by displaying 1*sigma error bars, we were able to claim that mass has no effect on period so long that the angle at release is less than  from vertical.

 the final experiment addressed the research question by testing if the overall length of the pendulum affected the time it took to complete one swing. our initial prediction was that as the length increased, so would the period. this initially seemed like the case, but more was needed to be done in order to ensure that are data was accurate enough to make claims off of. our scatterplot graph depicted points that were seemingly linear with a positive slope. through further uncertainty testing and by displaying 1*sigma error bars, we were able to claim that pendulum length did in fact influence the period. this was the case so long that the angle at release was less than  from vertical.

 through further experimentation and research, we also were able to assess the mathematical relationship between pendulum length and period. we initially learned that the period of a pendulum for small angles has an equation of      $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$           were ‘t’ is period time and ‘l’ is length in m. we more precisely tested tether length (this time in meters) to find the specific mathematical relationship between length and period. through excel, we concluded that based off of our data, the mathematical model was a power function as this yielded the highest r^2 value (0.9999). our overall formula was       $y=2.022 x^{0.503}$          . this result was greatly received as the base equation was x^0.503 (almost perfectly a square root function). solving for the coefficient of the theoretical model yielded 2.007 which was also close to our found coefficient of 2.022. the other variables (mass and angle at release) seemed to be linear with respect to period and had no slope. their equations would like be of the from y is ‘constant’ and thus do not subscribe to the theoretical or found models.

 for the first part of the experiment, we had an unreliable way of releasing the pendulum, resulting in times where the release angle may have varied from the intended value. this caused a certain amount of random error to be present as data could have been skewed either direction. additionally, timekeeping also presented an issue as delayed reaction times created systematic error, causing values for period to increase across the data set. however, we were able to greatly reduce these errors in later parts of the experiment. by using a photogate, we eliminated human error and reaction time, which greatly reduced the systematic error within our results. additionally, we now had the ability for another group member to keep holding the protractor at the top of the pendulum, allowing for the releaser to better line up the string at the correct angle. this greatly reduced random error in our results and allowed us to construct a mathematical model that was near identical to the theoretical one.

 lastly, there is one major constraint for this overall experiment is  this is that we preformed our trials in atmospheric conditions. air resistance, wind, friction, and other environmental factors have an increasing effect on the theoretical model as the angle at release increases. that is why the results we gathered are accurate only for angles less than  and why the mathematical relationship between period and length is not always accurate as angle at release increases.
