discussion and conclusion: 

this experiment took place over the weeks of september 24th and october 1st. the purpose behind the previous two lab sessions was to investigate how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. the independent variables were the mass of weight (red/white balls) and the mass of the block (mass of the system stays the same). the dependent variable was the acceleration of the system. the control variables were the force due to friction (assuming frictionless surface), length of the system (910mm), and the mass of the system (191.4 g). lab 05 assisted in answering this research question by allowing students to use a rotary motion detector with various masses of the block and the bobble (red/white balls hanging off of the block) to determine the relationship of varying applied forces on the acceleration of the system as shown in figure 2. students were also able to come up with a general mathematical equation and a specific equation relating to their own data. the general mathematical equation is as follows is   and the equation based off the data gathered from our system is is  $y=0.0042 x - 0.0114$. the general mathematical model answers the research question because mass and acceleration are related to force proportionally. also, there is no way to get rid of friction completely so force of friction must be accounted for in the equation and the mass of the system includes the mass of the moving cart and the hanging bobble which also must be accounted for in the experimental model.  table 1 and figure 1 both indicate that as the force (n) due to the hanging mass increases, the acceleration (m/s^2) also increases. the mass has an uncertainty value of 0.05 and the distance (control variable) has an uncertainty value of 0.005. lab 06 allowed groups to share their previous results and it turned out to be that all four groups had the same outcome is  as the applied force (n) increases, the acceleration of the system also increases. this shows a linear relationship as seen in table 2, figures 3 and 4, and the group pictures that are attached above. one constraint in this lab would be the limited amount of time during each lab period because students may rush and not obtain accurate or precise measurements which would affect the generalizability of the studentsâ€™ lab results. another constraint would be the weighing scale being uncalibrated or calibrated incorrectly resulting in skewed data regarding the various masses needed to calculate force (n) and how the changing masses affect the acceleration of the system. a third constraint would be air resistance and friction because as previously stated, one cannot completely get rid of friction, so these two variables must be accounted for while conducting the experiment and calculating data points. if not, data can be skewed, affecting group data and also give other groups false guidance when presenting individual group results and conclusions. lastly, if the track that the block was moving along was laid out incorrectly, or if the string which connected the bobble to the block, got caught while being measured, acceleration would have the potential of being negative instead of positive.
