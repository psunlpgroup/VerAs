conclusion:

the research question was, “what impacts the period of a pendulum?” the three experiments done isolated each component to answer the research question. the first experiment used string length as the independent variable. the period of the pendulum was the dependent variable. the graph with error bars proved that there is a direct correlation between the length of string and the period of the pendulum. the longer the string, the longer the period of the pendulum. the second experiment done used a change in angle released as the independent variable. the period of the pendulum was the dependent variable. the graph for this experiment shows that with the error bars, there is no correlation between the angle of release and the period of the pendulum. the third experiment used the change in mass at the end of the string as the independent variable and the period of the pendulum was the dependent variable. the graph for this experiment with error bars shows that there is no correlation between the mass and the period of the pendulum. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of the pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. this shows that the length of string is directly correlated to the period of the pendulum. this agrees with the outcome of the experiment conducted. the graph between the period of the pendulum and the length of string with error bars shows that the string length and the period of the pendulum are directly correlated. the angle of the release and the change in mass have no correlation to the period of the pendulum according to the theoretical mathematical model. this is confirmed by the other two tests conducted. the graphs for these two experiments with error bars show that there is indeed no correlation between the angle of release and the change in mass with the period of the pendulum. 

	there were multiple errors throughout these experiments. these include systematic errors and random errors. looking through the 3 graphs we created last lab, we found fluctuations in the mass vs. period graph. systematically, this could have been caused by not using the effective length rather than just the string length, inaccuracies in the stopwatch and inaccuracies in the mass of the weights. in terms of random error, we can attribute most of the error to inaccuracy in the use of the stopwatch, the view angle of the experiment, and human reaction time. systematic error could be reduced by measuring the effective length rather than just the string length. the random error was reduced by using a photogate to accurately capture the motion and time of the pendulum. another way is can be reduced is and viewing the pendulum from the same, direct, angle every time.



	a constraint in this experiment is that there was gravity present. this means that gravity was always acting on the pendulum. if the gravity was different, or there was no gravity, then the numbers could have been altered. this means that the experiment is confirmed accurate with gravity present only. if there was a different measure of gravity or no gravity at all, then there is no proof that the experiment would be accurate in this scenario.
