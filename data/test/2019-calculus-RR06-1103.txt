conclusion

the purpose of the force and motion lab was to be able to develop mathematical models which describe the real system. while we were doing this, we strengthen our understandings for the variables and numeric values included in the model. during our first two experiments in lab five we set the independent variable to be the mass of the bobs as well as the mass of the cart. when we tested mass of bobs, we got the mathematical model $y=2.9224 x - 0.021$ where x is force and relates to y which is acceleration so as the force increased the acceleration also increased. the graph shows a linear trend and shows that they are directly related. the r value is 1 which is a proves that it is a very strong linear correlation. the error bars are so miniscule that they show up on the graph. when we tested the mass of the system and its effect on the acceleration, we found that the more mass the cart was it led to a smaller acceleration. the graph shows this relationship. as the mass goes up acceleration goes down. the mathematical model for this is $y=\frac{108504}{x^{1.54}}$ this is an exponential decay function. as mass gets larger acceleration directly gets smaller. finally, when we tested the affects the magnets had on acceleration, we could see that it had a negative linear relationship. the more magnets we added the slower the acceleration. although this third experiment was to observe the effects that magnetic fields have on the system the findings supported our previous data. as we removed the bobs the acceleration got lower. these are the same findings we discovered from the second experiment.

the other two groups tested the effects that inclination have on the system. they both found that when you add a backwards tilt on the system the acceleration goes up. increasing the height of the back will increase the acceleration of the system. this strengthens our understanding of the constant in our data. the constant comes from the condition of the track and friction. there are several errors that could have taken place in this experiment. one random error that may have come from this experiment might be incorrect massing of the bobs and the system. this would lead to incorrect mathematical equations that would wrongly identify the relationship between mass/force and acceleration. we could have taken many masses and averaged the values to get a more exact mass. in the experiment we assumed that it was a frictionless surface. this is not true and there were small amounts of friction. this creates a systematic error in our data. to fix this we would have to find the friction on the track and its effect on the system. lastly, although we tested inclination there still might have been dips that affected our data. some constraints that may have limited our data are the number of bobs. since we were given a limited number of bobs, we couldn’t test extreme values of bobs to see if the data was consistent with fifty bobs. also, the air wasn’t strong enough to carry the system when it had too much weight on it, so we weren’t able to take data for magnets at low bob values. it would be able to move very well. our data is consistent with newtons second law. our first two experiments showed the same relationship $f=m a$ that newton came up with. as forces increases and mass stays consistent the acceleration goes up. as mass goes down and forces remains constant acceleration goes up. showing the inverse relationship of $\frac{f}{m}=a$. this is just rewrite of newtons second law.
