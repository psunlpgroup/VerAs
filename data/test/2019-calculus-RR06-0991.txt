discussion and conclusion



	the overarching research question for labs 5 and 6 was: what factors affect the acceleration of the air track cart-pulley system? with respect to this the goal of lab 5 was to create accurate mathematical models of this real-world system and the goal of lab 6 was to gain an understanding of what the values included within these models correspond to in terms of the physical system.

	the first experiment of lab 5, in which hanging mass was treated as an independent variable while system mass was kept constant, yielded the following conclusion is  there is a positive, linear relationship between the hanging mass and the system’s acceleration for a system of total mass 339.40 g and for hanging masses between 13.50 and 36.51 g. as seen in figure 1, the best fit line created for the graph of hanging mass vs. system acceleration fits the data almost perfectly; with an r-squared value of 0.9998, 99.98% of the variance in acceleration can be explained by the variation in hanging mass. likewise, the error bars on the data, ± 0.05 g horizontally and ± 0.001 m/s2 vertically, are too small to even be seen, giving high confidence in the data. these values were taken from the precision of the balance used and the reported error of the pulley sensor respectively. since the bars are not visible, it goes without saying that every data point is well outside of the range for the equivalency criterion of any other.

	the mathematical model created from this experiment can be seen in symbolic form below is 



the coefficient of hanging mass in this equation implies that for every gram of the total system mass that is shifted to the hanging mass the system’s acceleration will increase by 0.0287 m/s2. the validity of this with regards to newton’s 2nd law will be discussed later. the presence of a negative constant in the equation indicates that some force or combination of forces is resisting the movement of the cart on the air track; physically this negative y-intercept implies that there is some minimum hanging mass for which the cart will accelerate.

	the second experiment of lab 5 was not completed by group 5, but data provided by dr. koenig of system mass vs. acceleration has been used for discussion and conclusions. this data yields the following conclusion is  there is a negative, non-linear relationship between the total mass of the system and its acceleration given a constant hanging mass of 0.0151 kg and for cart masses from 0.301 to 0.601 kg. as seen in figure 2, the best fit line, in the form of a negative power function, fits the data extremely well, again with an r-squared value of 0.9998. error bars of 0.000005 kg horizontally and 0.001 m/s2 are included but are again too small to be seen, implying by the equivalency criterion that every data point is statistically unique. 

	
in this equation the constant being divided by the mass of the cart represents the net force acting on the system, while the exponent of the mass has no clear physical meaning other than as an indicator that some error is present since its value should theoretically be one. this is discussed later.

	the experiment conducted in lab 6 was designed to determine the effect of positive track tilt on the system’s acceleration, specifically as a possible factor contributing to the constant found in the hanging mass model generated by the first experiment. this experiment yielded the following conclusion is  as the track is more positively tilted in the range of 0.3 to 0.9 cm higher at the end furthest from the pulley, the constant of the models generated for the hanging mass vs. acceleration experiment, discussed previously, increases. figure 3, the graph of this experiment’s data, strongly supports this conclusion. the r-squared values of each model are extremely high once again, with the lowest being 0.9984. the slopes of each model are also with ± 0.0002 of each other, strongly suggesting that the only thing changing between models and due to the tilt of the track is the added constant.


	the models created by group 6, seen in figure 4, strongly agree with the trend observed by group 5. as the height of the track furthest from the pulley is increased, the constant added to the corresponding model increases. this gives validation to the conclusion already made that positive tilt positively correlates with the constant of the model relating hanging mass and acceleration.

	group 3 tested negative tilt rather than positive, but their findings still follow the trend seen by groups 5 and 6. their data can be seen in figure 5 above. as tilt in increased in the negative direction, the constant of the model relating hanging mass and acceleration decreases.

	the two sources of random error in all three experiments were the precision of the balance used and the reported error of the pulley sensor. while a higher precision digital scale may be used to reduce the random error in mass measurements, random error in these experiments was negligible, so this would be unnecessary. possible sources of systematic error include the tilt of the track as well as resistive forces like friction in the pulley sensor or (likely negligible) air resistance/friction on the track. track tilt may be eliminated using either a bubble level or simply the cart itself, adding shims under one end of the track or the other until perfectly level. friction in the pulley sensor may possibly be reduced by oiling or otherwise lubricating the rotational mechanism of the sensor or using a sensor with less resistance.

	numerical constraints with regards to the range of data evaluated are discussed in each experiment’s individual conclusion. in general, however, the purpose of these labs was to use data to model the exact physical system being examined and explain differences between these models and theory based on physical aspects of the system. to apply the specific models generated to other systems would defeat this purpose. rather, the idea that physical systems can be accurately modeled in order to identify factors not taken into account by assumed theory can be applied universally.

	the theoretical equation for an ideal equivalent of the system tested in the first experiment is as follows is 



this equation assumes that no other forces but the force of gravity on the hanging mass are acting on the system. accounting for other possible forces yields the following is 

     or     

entering values of units matching those used experimentally to determine an equation of the same form as the generated mathematical model gives is 



this theoretical coefficient is incredibly close to that which was found experimentally; in fact, the experimental coefficient has a percent error of only 0.69%. since a constant is present in the experimental model, there must be at least one other factor at play, as shown in the middle equations above.

	the theoretical equation for the second experiment is simply is 



thus, assuming that only one force is present and using the same units as those in the second experiment the following equation is generated is 



this is again close to that which was found experimentally; the percent errors for the coefficient and exponent are 7.16% and 3.1% respectively.



(there is mention of a “heavy string” scenario in the rubric, but with no further information given it is unclear what is desired for this; a heavy string (i.e. a string whose mass significantly contributes to the mass of the system) would decrease the acceleration of the system for a given applied force just like any other increase in mass would.)
