conclusion:
	the purpose of the lab was to determine the mathematical models describing the real system of acceleration vs. force and acceleration vs. mass of the system for lab five. for part two of the lab, the real mathematical model was to determine the mathematical model if the tilt was increased for the air track. all the mathematical models including the graphs were from the program excel. the data tables were recorded and then the data was used to create the model and the graph. the overall mass of the system was the sum of mass one and two this number is equal to 1/(the slope of the equation). the force of the system was changed by moving the mass from mass one to mass two which keeps the mass in the system the same. the force is represented by x in the equations. the acceleration of the system is how rate that mass 2 fell to the ground which is represented by y. in lab six, the y intercept for the mathematical model increases as the tilt increases. this occurs because as the larger angle of release, the more potential energy is in the system. this doesn’t affect the mass or the forces acting on the system but allows for a larger output.



	 group 6 did the opposite experiment as our group as they decided to tilt the track backwards. this effect caused the slope of the line to decrease. this is an unexpected result as this does not correlate with what our group received as our results. if our results are correct, then we would expect group 6’s models to have a similar constant slope but instead their slope is decreasing, and the y intercept is changing randomly. 

	group 2’s data changed the level of friction of the data. this data reflects our data more than group 6’s data. this has me believe that our group must have had some sort of error in our system where our results appeared to look more like group 2’s even though our test was not similar. some of the errors that could have occurred were from the program as we couldn’t find the exact slope of the line at some point. this would be a systematic error as we always took the slope that was more positive than the actual line and would increase the values of the slope. an error that would be random would be possible wind in the room that could slow down or speed up the car. we could have performed this task by using a better program that can allow for the manual placement of lines to determine the slope instead of doing it by each singular point. 

	some of the constraints in this experiment that limit the generalizability of our results are force of friction is unknown and the amount of time we had to perform experiments as we could have collected more data points for more accurate overall data.
