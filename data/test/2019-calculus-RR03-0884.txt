discussion and conclusion:  

the research question being investigated in this lab is what affects the period of a pendulum. the first experiment addressed this question because we conducted three different tests with different independent variables and control variables to see what truly did affect the period of the pendulum. we set each factor, length of the pendulum, mass, and the angle of release, against the time it took to complete a period. therefore, we were able to identify what factors effected the period of the pendulum. we can claim that the length of the string was the only factor that we tested that had any noticeable effect on the period of the pendulum. this is because the mass vs period graph’s data points have no correlation, the graph for the angle vs period has overlapping error bars meaning essentially no relation. the only graph that has a positive linear slope is the length vs period. meaning that there is a direct relationship between the length and the period.

the second experiment was designed to eliminate the errors that were made in lab one. we were tasked to identify potential errors in the first experiment, and then to either make them smaller or eliminate them in the second experiment. this experiment related back to the research question because it justified the claims we made in the first experiment by giving us more reliable data on what effects the period of a pendulum. 

in the third experiment, we were given a timing mechanism that was very accurate and precise. this instrument allowed us to minimize one of the largest sources of error in this lab, the timing of the period. we were then able to get very strong repeatable results for each trial conducted due to the precise laser timer. this pertained to the research question because this experiment justified the claims we had made in the prior labs with more precise data and repeatable data. 

after three of the experiments, we can claim that the mass has no effect on the pendulum’s period, this is because when looking at the graph for mass vs period, the points on the graph do not have a clear pattern or slope. we can conclude that the length of the pendulum is directly related to the pendulum’s period because the graph of length vs period has a clear positive linear slope. we can also claim that the angle of release has no relationship with the period because the graph of angle vs period has over lapping error bars. these claims are true under the condition where the angle is less than 30⁰, and the mass is less than 250g. 

the theoretical mathematical model that was created was . this was created through excel, where t is the time it takes to complete a period, and l is the length. our data fits with the model because it shows that the angle and mass have no effect on the period of a pendulum. the only variables in the equation are time and length. we can also determine this because the graphs for angle and mass have overlapping error bars indicating that they have no relationship. but, the graph for the length has no over lapping error bars and a clear positive linear slope. 	

some of the constraints that might be limiting the generalizability of our claims are the constraints due to the supplies we had. perhaps if the pendulum was heavier than 250g the mass would cause the pendulum to behave differently. another constraint that may be limiting our claims is that the angle had to be less than 30⁰. if the angle had been greater than 30⁰ the results could have been different.
