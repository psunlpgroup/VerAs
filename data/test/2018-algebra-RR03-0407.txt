discussion

the purpose of this lab was to obtain which independent variables affect the small swing of a pendulums period. each variable was tested for the time it took to complete one period using a stopwatch. the stopwatch has an uncertainty value of .05 seconds. one random error that could have occurred was when taking time measurements using the stopwatch. there was only one individual taking the measurements each time, however having three people take each measurement of the period and taking the average of the three numbers could have reduced this possible error. a possible systematic error could be the weight used was not exactly weighing to what it was saying to be. this error could not be reduced by taking an average of data. it would just cause a shift in the data, but it would do so with all of the data rather than be different for each value.

with the total length as the independent variable, there was a strong correlation to the pendulumâ€™s period. the longer the length of the pendulum and the longer it took for the pendulum to complete one period. graph 1 shows this correlation. the error bars (graph 1) overlapped the least out of the three initial independent variable tests. this means that the total length had the greatest effect on the period. there is an uncertainty value of .05 cm with the ruler. with the mass as the independent variable, there was no correlation between the weight of the pendulum and the time it took the pendulum to complete one swing. graph 3 shows the lack of correlation with the mass as the independent variable. there was a large amount of overlapping between the error bars on the graph, meaning that there is not a strong different between each point of measurement. the scale has an uncertainty value of .05 g. this combined with the error bars shows that there is not a change in period of the pendulum with different masses. with the angle of the swing as the independent variables, there was no correlation. as seen on graph 4, the slope of the line is very small, almost zero. this shows there is no correlation between the independent variable tested, mass, and time. 

in week three, the independent variable of total length was tested again due to it being the only variable showing a strong correlation. it was retested using a photogate, with an uncertainty value of .001s. using the photogate (graph 2, table 3) gave a much more accurate reading of the time it took the pendulum to complete one length.



conclusion

to conclude, using the photogate confirmed the stated hypothesis, that the total length of the pendulum would correlate most strongly to the time it took to complete one period. it shows (graphs 1 and 2, tables 2 and 3) that at each length tested, the longer the length, the longer the period. due to the pendulum only being able to go up to a height determined by the string length and the holder attached to the desks, much larger values for height could not be tested to see if they fall on the line the data gives. 

	the equation determined from this experiment was . this supports the data found within the lab. if values of length from tables 2 and 3 were plugged in, then the answers from the model would fit with the data found in lab.
