discussion and conclusion



the purpose of lab 05 and 06 was to develop mathematical models that describe the behavior of a system and understand what each variable does in the numerical values of the models. 



	with the first experiment in lab 05, our independent variable was the force applied on the end of the pully. we confirmed that as we added mass to the side of the pully, our acceleration increases (or was directly proportional). as you can see as well with our graph, as the mass increased, the acceleration increased, leaving us with a positive, linear slope and an r-squared value of .9973. for our best fit line, we somehow acquired a negative y-intercept though which is most likely due from human error. for the next experiment in lab 05, we tested our independent variable as the mass of the system. to explain, we added mass to the slide which overall led to a decrease in acceleration. as shown in the graph for experiment 2, you can see a negative, exponential slope (shown by the exponent being -3.251) and a r-squared value of .9373. for the last experiment, we set the independent variable as the tilt of the track which was accomplished by adding plates under the one side of the track giving the cart an added acceleration due to the x-axis value of gravity. as shown in the 3 graphs above for this experiment, the correlations between force and acceleration are linear with the lowest r-squared value of .9994 and positive coefficients of x in the best fit equations. where they differ is the coefficient of the slope, which mathematically should have increased by the increase in the thickness of the plate put under the track. this error may most likely be from the track having an initial tilt but could have been partially in calibration of the accelerometer.

group #1  group #2

since group #1 found that as the tilt increases, the acceleration also increases, it further explained our error in our data and calculated equation. group #2 tested if increase of friction would decrease the acceleration which we did not test but mathematically it should decrease the acceleration and do not know if their method of applying friction was accurate. from what we collected, the force applied either from the hanging mass or the tilt in the system increases the coefficient of x in the equations. errors that i mentioned earlier, including initial tilt(systematic) and possibly calibration of the accelerometer(random), have made the results slightly inaccurate but other things like weight of the bobbers(random) should have been more precise. we could have reduced these errors by using set weighted pieces that are precise and checking the initial tilt of the track (or taking that into account for the equation). not considering the initial tilt of the track can also be considered a constraint in the generalizability of the equation and results. another constraint should also be not taking in account for the acceleration of gravity as a variable in the equations. our mathematical models also are consistent with newtonâ€™s second law ($f=ma$ since with experiment 1, as applied force increases and mass of the system stays the same, acceleration of the system must also increase (which is shown in the trend in the graph and the best fit line). likewise, if the mass of the system is increased and the force applied is the same like shown with experiment 2, then acceleration must decrease (also shown with the best fit line).
