discussion and conclusion:



as hypothesized, the mass of the hanging part of the system had a direct relationship with the acceleration of the system. that is, by increasing the mass on the hanging part of the system, the acceleration of the system increased which can concluded by the fast movement of the cart as well as the data collected to the computer. it is the other way around when the mass of the cart was increased. 



whereas, the friction had an inverse relationship with the acceleration of the system. that is, by increasing the friction on the cart, the acceleration of the system decreased which can be evidenced by the slow movement of the cart as well as the data collected.

as for the errors, very few of them existed which are mostly of the physical balance and minute deviations of the device for measuring acceleration. the error bars were too small to read and comprehend the error.


most of the other errors that could have been caused in this experiment have been minimized as much as possible by collecting five data points for every reading. in addition, if the string is considerably heavy, the results could go offset by a great amount depending on how heavy the string is.

the above pictures demonstrate how well our models and conclusions compared with the models of our fellow teams.
