discussion and conclusion

	the collective experiments in weeks 1-3 aimed to answer the question of what impacts the period of a pendulum swing. the specific factors investigated were mass of pendulum, string length, and angle of release, and over the course of the experiments, it was determined which of these independent variables has a relationship with period of a pendulum. 

week 1, introduction to experimental design, showed that there was a relationship only between one of these independent variables and the period of a pendulum. with mass as the independent variable, it was hypothesized that there is a relationship between mass and period of a pendulum. it was predicted that a greater mass would result in a greater period. however, the data shows that there is no relationship between mass and period, which is displayed in table 2 and figure 1. the error bars show that a line with no slope fits the data. therefore, the prediction was shown to be incorrect. next, angle of release was the independent variable, and it was hypothesized that there would be a relationship. the prediction was that as angle increased, so would the period. upon exploring the effect of the angle of release, it was shown that there was actually no relationship, as seen in figure 2. the error bars again show that there is a no slope in the best fit line. with string length as the independent variable, it was hypothesized that there would be no relationship. it was predicted that the period would not change as string length changed, as long as mass and angle were kept constant. the results of this experiment discredited this prediction. the string length was, in fact, the independent variable that showed a relationship with period, and this can be seen in figure 3, which has error bars indicating a positive relationship. 

in week 2, introduction to error analysis, the performance of 10 trials with no independent variable showed that there was a standard deviation of .023, indicating the presence of random errors. random errors such as human inconsistency in stop watch timing and human inconsistency in positioning pendulum at correct angles were considered. these could be fixed by taking the average of three stop watches and by setting the pendulum on an apparatus with the exact angle each time. the systematic errors considered included an incorrectly calibrated triple beam balance, making all values either too high or too low, and the elongation of the string when weight was added, which would have made all values for period too high. ways to reduce these systematic errors would be to zero the balance between each trial and to measure the string length before each trial. in general, systematic error, if recognized, may be accounted for in the data by adjusting each data point. overall, the constraints for this experiment were that it was heavily subject to human error, the equipment used did offer reliable accuracy or precision, and time allotted for each lab. human error and faulty equipment could have skewed results, while the limiting time did not allow for maximum trials, lowering the reliability of the results. 

	in week 3, the effect of string length on period could be more properly assessed through the use of a photogate, which eliminated the constraint of inaccurate equipment. over 10 trials, it was shown that there was a positive relationship between string length and period. the data is represented by a power series curve, shown in figure 5. the mathematical model was determined to be 1.05^.302. this differs from the theoretical model of $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, which could really never be fully replicated due to human error. in this case it could have been an inconsistent angle of release. 

	over the course of three weeks it was seen that string length is the independent variable that impacts the period of a pendulum. considering the possible errors, and redoing this experimental portion with the photogate showed that there is a strong positive relationship.
