 what affects the period of a pendulum? 

 in total, three different independent variables were tested to determine if they affect the period of the pendulum. the first experiment tested changing the angle of release of the pendulum to see if it changed the period. the claim stated was that this variable will not change the period, based on the results from the experiment this claim was correct. there was no significant change in the period as the angle of release was changed. the second experiment tested whether changing the mass of the weight on the end of the pendulum affected the duration of the period. the claim stated in this experiment was the mass of the weight would not affect the duration of the period. based on the results gathered, our claim was supported. as the mass of the weight changed there was no significant change in the duration of the period. the last experiment tested whether the length of the pendulum changes the duration of the period. the claim stated in this experiment was the length of the pendulum would affect the duration of the period. the results gathered from the experiment supported this claim. as the length of the pendulum was increased, the duration of the period changed significantly enough to show a correlation between the two in the positive direction.

 the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum was $y=0.11293764 x$. our data fit with this model due to it showing the power rule, as the length increased, the period of the pendulum increased while slowly leveling out. this leveling out of the period, visually represents this equation.

 throughout this experiment no systematic error occurred, but random error did occur. random error that was present was the pendulum not swinging perfectly in the vertical plane of its path. when released off plane, the period cannot be accurately measured because the distance being traveled by the swing of the pendulum will not be constant. another random error that was present was the angle of launch not being perfectly measured due to the distance of the protractor from the string as well as the movement of the protractor between trials. early on in the experiments when period was measured by stopwatches, the reaction time of the human eye to the fingers would cause random error in timing. by the last experiment, this was corrected by the laser gate timer used.

constraints in the experiment that could limit the generalizability of the results could be the problems faced trying to align the period to swing in a straight plane as well as the angle of launch being constant every trial.
