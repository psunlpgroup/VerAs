discussion and conclusion

in the fifth and sixth labs, we investigated the effect of a force applied on a system on the acceleration of the system. this was done by measuring the slope of the velocity of a system over a period of time while changing the force on the system by applying mass using pulleys of changing mass. measurements were taken using the datastudio program. 

	the data displayed in section i show that the force applied on a system and the acceleration of the system are related. it is evident that as the mass on the pulley, and therefore the force applied on the system, increases, the acceleration of the system increases as well. as the error bars are extremely small and the r-squared value is very close to 1, as shown in graph 1, the association can be determined to be linear. 

	according to the equation of the line of best fit as shown in graph 1, the relationship between the force applied and the acceleration appears to be $a=4.1719 f + 0.0475$ where a is the acceleration of the system in meters per second squared, and f is force applied to the system by weight in newtons, calculated by multiplying the mass of the bobs hanging off of the system by the acceleration due to gravity. this relationship makes sense, because it is consistent with newton’s second law, $f=m a$, since the change in f and change in a are directly related. since our model shows the relation between force and acceleration, we can calculate the expected mass by finding the coefficient. to solve this, we use the modeled equation, $a = 4.1719 f + 0.0475$. we can ignore the intercept because it is small and does not exist in newton’s second law. solving for mass in newton’s second law gives is  $f=m a$; $m=\frac{f}{a}$. therefore, by solving for f/a in our model, the expected mass can be found. $a = 4.1719 f$; $\frac{f}{a} = 0.2397$. our expected system mass, based on our model and newton’s second law, is 236.7g. however, the actual mass of the system is 174.05g. this difference can be explained by some inconsistencies between our experiment and the ideal conditions in which the second law exists and experimental errors.

	looking at the combined data from graph 2 and graph 3, the line of best fit for graph 2 had a smaller r-squared value than any of the r-squared values of the lines of best fit from graph 3. this could be due to the fact that, while the mass of the system is constant in each of the trials, a different mass could have been used for each one. therefore, even though a constant was used, it was a different constant for each of the three groups. overall, the group displayed in figure 1, with their constant mass of 0.189kg and the slope 5.13, had the furthest trendline from the theoretical value given by newton’s second law. 

	some random errors may have occurred during the experiment. this could include errors on our part measuring the mass on the pulley. our experimental mathematical model did not account for the tension force in the string. although this theoretically should be the same as the hanging mass, there can be some level of air resistance affecting the force of mass. there is also friction on the pulley affecting the force of the overall system, which then changes the acceleration. some systematic errors that may have impacted our results include the tape measure and the triple beam balance having inaccurate increments, and the datastudio measuring the velocity incorrectly. additionally, if the string had an appreciable mass, the acceleration of the cart would still undergo a uniform acceleration because the mass of the string is included as part of the mass of the system in the first place. therefore, if the mass had an appreciable mass, then it would still display a uniform acceleration as the mass of the string would still be included as part of the system.
