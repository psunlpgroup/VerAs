conclusion

	in the case that a heavy string was used in place of the assumed massless string in this experiment, data would likely change from what was collected. a more massive string would be included in the total mass of the cart-bob system but would also contribute to the mass of the bob. the cart travels towards the end of the track and more string is fed over the pulley, this means that more string than before is apart of the bob mass and this means that the bob mass is no longer constant for the whole trial. the acceleration of the cart would likely decrease slightly initially, and then possibly increase near the end of the acceleration period.

	random errors involved with these trials may crop up in many places. for example, the masses of the bobbers were measured via a scale using human power. this is not always perfect and may have led to incorrect bobber masses. this can be corrected for by using a more precise scale and zeroing the scale before every measurement. additionally, the air-cart may not have been released from the same point every time regardless of our best intentions. this is a smaller error since the slope of the velocity graph will likely be the same, but small inconsistencies like this may influence data. additionally, more error may come from the track. this error can be reduced by being more considerate with cart placement on the track. in lab 05, the track was not completely level. after the trials, in a non-experimentary fashion, the air0cart was placed on the track and then the vacuum fan was switched on. the cart then began accelerated. this showed that the track was not completely level, and this may have influenced the data. this error could be reduced by leveling the track prior to collecting data. finally, another error could be the vacuum system not distributing the air in the air track evenly. this is particularly important since the experiment was conducted at the opposite end of the vacuum fan hose port. this could be fixed by implementing a better vacuum system or track. 

	constraints within the experiment can be seen in a variety of places. to begin, the mass of the system was kept constant in both applications. this has limitations since the data only truly applies to that specific mass and data cannot be extrapolated with certainty from it. therefore the generalizations of the data only apply to one specific system mass value. a better, more thorough experiment would be conducted with numerous different system mass values. other constraints such as the limited trials for each experiment may contribute to the decreased usability of the data in other applications.
