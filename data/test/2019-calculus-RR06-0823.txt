discussion and conclusion:

	the main purpose of this lab was to create a mathematical model to understand how a real system works, and what affects can be observed from changing the variables. two different experiments were conducted. in the first experiment, the objective was to observe how changing the mass of the hanging mass would affect the acceleration of the system. after collecting data, the mathematical model found was $a=0.0482$. this was found from the trendline in graph 1, “mass of mass 2 vs. acceleration.” the second experiment conducted was to test how different force values affect the acceleration of the system. this was done by changing the height at either end of the track, changing the value of force. everything else in the system was constant, so only the relationship between force and acceleration can be observed. the mathematical model found was $a= -9e + 0.003 f - 16$. this was found by creating a trendline for graph 2, “applied force vs. acceleration.” hypothesis for both experiments were correct, so claims can be made for changing the value for different variables. as the hanging mass increases, the acceleration of the system will increase. as the force on the system increases, the acceleration of the system will increase. we are confident in our claims, because as seen from other groups data, they obtained similar trendlines for force vs. acceleration, which showed a positive correlation for increasing force. 

	the equation for force in a system can be given as net $f = m a$. our mathematical models support the equation. the first experiment resulted in an increase of mass increasing the acceleration. the second experiment resulted in an increase of force (by increasing height at one end of the track) increasing the acceleration. if we were to redo the experiments with a heavy string, the mass of the system would be greater than that of the system with the light string. if the mass of the system increases, then the acceleration of the system would decrease, because $a =\frac{f}{m}$. one systematic error could be an inconsistency within the pressure of the air coming out of the holes in the track. the holes most likely don’t exert the same air pressure when the track is turned on. random errors could include measuring the weight of the bobbers, because we used a manual scale. the measurements are most likely not the exact value, and this could be improved by using a calibrated digital scale. constraints include a time constraint. we had enough data to either support or refute our hypothesis, but if we had time to get more data we could make a stronger argument. overall, the mathematical models produced support newtons second law, $f = m a$.
