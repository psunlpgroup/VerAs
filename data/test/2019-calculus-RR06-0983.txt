Discussion and Conclusion
The purpose of Lab 05 was to gather data on two different factors that impact the acceleration of a system and to create mathematical models for these two factors for how they affected the behavior of this particular system. Lab 06’s purpose was to understand each variable and the values obtained in the data for how the angle of inclination of the track affected the acceleration of the cart.

For the first experiment in lab 5 we tested the relationship between the weight/force of the hanging mass and the acceleration of the cart. There was a positive correlation here, since the acceleration increased as more bobs were added to the hanging mass. The mathematical model proves this since the slope in Figure 1 is 0.003 and the R2 value was 0.9998. The second relationship in lab 5 tested the relationship between the mass on top of the cart and the acceleration. The slope of -0.396 in Figure 2 proves there was a negative correlation between these two factors with and R2 value of 0.9782. Both models had a strong linear relationship as shown by the high R2 values. The thirds experiment in lab 6 was an investigation into how the angle of inclination of the track would affect the acceleration of the cart. According to the mathematical models for Figures 4, 5 and 6 the slope stayed around 0.003, but the y-intercept slightly increased every time the angle increased. So, we concluded that the angle of inclination doesn’t affect the numerical values significantly. The slope in each of these models represented the independent variable such as the weight/force of the hanging mass, mass on the cart and the angle of inclination. The y-intercept represents how much the dependent variable is affected by the independent variable times the slope. 

In lab 6, Group 2 investigated friction’s effect on the acceleration. They hypothesized that more friction will result in less acceleration. The slope of all three models also stayed the same around 2, so this validates our slopes not changing as well. Group 5’s slope was .0028 for a track incline of 9.5 mm and a slope of .0028 for a track incline of 19.02mm.  This confirms our data because our slopes also stayed constant at that value as the incline increased. This proves that no other factor except mass affect the acceleration of a system.

A systematic error was the surface of the track was not perfectly frictionless, and $F = m a$ pertains to systems that are perfectly frictionless. Another systematic error could be that the position of the cart each time was not in the same exact position each time or that the bobs hanging off the string were still swinging while the test was running on the computer. 

Some constraints were the amount of bobs we had and the reaction time of us to stop the test on the program. These didn’t have too much effect since we had strong data and our R2 was very high.

 The two models relate to Newton’s Second Law of $F = m a$, since they prove that only mass has a n effect on the acceleration of a system, since gravitational acceleration is constant.
