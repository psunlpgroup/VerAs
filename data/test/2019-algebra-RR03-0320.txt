conclusion



the research question being investigated in this lab is what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. through the investigation, it can be concluded that there is no relationship between the mass and the period of the pendulum because the graph of mass versus period shows as mass increases, the period remains the same. initially after completing the first experiments for this report, it was concluded that the angle of release did in fact have an effect on the period. but, after further testing and making the angle of less than 20 degrees, we found that the effect the angle had on the period could be eliminated. the same relationship was then concluded for the graph of angle of release versus period. the graph for length versus period showed that the relationship between the angle and period of the pendulum are directly proportional. this conclusion can be concluded from the graph because as the length of the string increases, the period increases as well making the relationship linear with the shape of a parabola. the theoretical mathematical model is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. we could relate the model to the equation we derived from our graph because they both have what would be considered to be a slope and the b value in an equation of a line. there were both systematic and random errors present in the experiment. some systematic errors that were present were incorrect measurement of angles, length and string, not adding the correct amount of weight, releasing the pendulum with different forces, and delayed reaction when starting or stopping the stopwatch. some random errors present were movement of people causing wind to blow on the pendulum and movement of chairs causing vibrations affecting the pendulum. the problem of incorrect measurements and controllable errors were fixed to reduce the systematic errors present and the random errors were reduced by taking the average of repeated measurements and perfecting the techniques used for measurements.
