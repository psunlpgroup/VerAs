conclusion and discussion:



	the data that was collected during this experiment allowed the evaluation of the previous stated hypotheses. the hypothesis that the mass of the ball and the angle from which the ball is dropped can be refuted. evidence for this claim can be found by analyzing the data collected and observing it graphically. in graph 1, the effect of the mass of the ball on the pendulum was shown as fairly linear. although the trend line on the graph appears to have a slope it can be argued that the slope of the line is due to the values on the y-axis increasing minimally. graph 3 shows the effect of angle on a pendulum, which can also be considered fairly linear. the slope of this line (0.0085) is nearly zero, i.e. a horizontal line, showing no real effect on the period of the pendulum. when considering the equivalency criterion, there was an overlap between mass and angle, which supports the conclusion that there is no correlation. because there was no overlap for length, it can be concluded that it does in fact have a relationship with the period of the pendulum. this idea continues to be supported in graph 2  this graph shows the effect of the length of string on the period of the pendulum, allows us to accept the hypothesis made. length of the string does effect the period of the pendulum. graph 2 shows a slope of 0.07, which is closer to one than the other two graphs which stayed fairly horizontal. a larger slope could have been due to the small number of trials run. it would be useful to repeat this experiment and run ten trials or twenty to get more data points to create a more accurate scatter plot with a slope more likely to represent this idea. graph 4 and 5 also show data when length of the string was the independent variable, and period was measured. however, the difference between graph 2, and 4 and 5 is that measurements for period of the pendulum taken for graph 2 are done by a stop watch, which allows for error. this is why the error bars are larger on this graph (with uncertainty values of 0.05), than on graphs 4 and 5 where measurements for the period of the pendulum were collected using a photogate. when using the photo gate, is was acceptable to assume an uncertainty of 0.001. although graph 2 gave vague support for the acceptance of the hypothesis, graphs 4 and 5 continued to give more detailed support. data for graphs 4 and 5 are more accurate and precise by diminishing the ability to have human error, as well as the fact that more data points were taken. in graph 5, the results from curve fitting are visible. the best possible line that fits the data points is a power equation. the power curve is the best fit for the line because when testing for exponential or linear, the exponential r-value is 0.9733 and the linear r-value is 0.9937, and the power r-value is 0.9998, which is closest to one, therefore the best fit.the equation for the specific data points collected is $y=0.2333 x^{0.4701}$.



theoretical equation is  $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$  (theoretical value is 1.42)



mathematical model obtained is  $y=0.2333 x^{0.4701}$



	the mathematical model obtained is fairly similar to the theoretical equation. this was proved by using substituting a length of 50 cm into both equations. when substituted into the theoretical equation, the theoretical value would be 1.42 seconds. when substituted into the mathematical model obtained, it resulted in a period of 1.47 seconds. therefore, because the experimental value differed from the theoretical value by 0.05, it can be concluded the two equations are similar. 

	random errors that may have occurred during the lab include, timing accuracy with the stop watch, the angle from which the ball was dropped, and the measurement taken of the length of string. systematic errors that may have occurred during the lab include, the true value of the weights, and string elasticity. these errors could be reduced by having multiple people take the same measurement, and then taking the average of those measurements to decrease the value deviation from the true value. it would also be helpful to use a measuring tape with even smaller measurement increments to make a more accurate and precise measurement. finally, zeroing out a scale and placing the weights being used on the scale to determine if their weight differs slightly from what is engraved on them would help alleviate any false measurements. however using the photo gate versus the stop watch helped alleviate errors that may have raised from too fast or too slow reaction times. one constraint that should be taken into consideration is that measurements with the photo gate could only be taken as far down as the floor to the top of the pole the string was attached. therefore there was a limit on how much data could be collected. 

	finally, taking into consideration the data collected, the errors that may have occurred and the constraints it can still be concluded that the length of the string has an effect on the period of the pendulum whereas the mass and angle have no effect.
