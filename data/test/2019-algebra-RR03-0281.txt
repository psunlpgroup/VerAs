discussion &conclusion:

	in this lab my group was testing to see what variables affects the time it takes for a pendulum to complete a period of swings. in the first test we were testing to see if the mass affects the time it took to complete a period of swing in a pendulum. we hypothesized that if the mass were to change the amount of time it would take to complete a period would also change. during the experiment, as we increase the weight, we saw a steady increase in the time it takes to complete the period, but during the last test the time took the least amount of time to complete the period with the most amount of weight (figure 1 for reference). so, then we added error bars to the graph and saw that the error bars overlap which means that the time might not have change during the experiment due to random error. the line in figure 1 should not be increasing instead it should be more constant, but the random error skewed our data. we predicted that the random error occurred because it relied on the reaction time and sight of the person timing the pendulum. some ways to prevent this is collecting more times in one run and averaging them out or by using more accurate data collecting tools, like motion sensors and cameras. 

in test 2, my group tested if the angle of release affected the time it took for the pendulum to complete a period. we hypothesized that if the starting angle changed then the time it took to complete a period would also change. in figure 2, the graph displays that the time is steadily increase when the angle is increase. the line shows that the function is linear by having a direct relationship between the angle and the time it takes to complete the period. then the group added error bars and saw that the error bars over lapping once again whish means that that the data probably didn’t change due to random error. this random error could possibly be the same as the one state in test 1. another way to fix this is taking a slow-motion camera and videotaping the experiment with a stop clock in the picture and taking the start time and stop difference to get the time elapsed.

in test 3, the group tested to see if the length of the string affected the time that it takes for the pendulum to complete the period. we predict that when we change the length of the string change so did the time it took to complete a period. in figure 3 one could see that the time and the length of the string has a direct relationship, if one decreases the other does to. then we added the error bars and saw that they weren’t overlapping which means that the data was changing, but there still was random error in the data collect. the random error could have occurred by the same factors before, the reaction time and eyesight of the timer. to fix this we could use better recording equip like motion sensors.

in test 4, we retested the length of the string vs. time it took to complete the period. we used sensors to improve the accuracy of our data and we collect more data. in figure 4 one could see that we came up with almost the same results as last test. we came up with that when the length of the string changed so did the time. the one difference is that the figure 4 is a power function where as figure 3 is more of a linear function. we came up with the equation $y=0.18653598 x$ , this equation is a power function and we used the r squared value to prove how accurate the line is. the r squared value is 0.9984. also, when we added the error bars the bars conclude that the scale of error in data was .001. knowing that the error was so low the error could only have been systematic, which we cannot change unless we get better equipment. a constraint we could have had is not having enough timers to collect more data, because the more data you have you get better averages which reduces the error.
