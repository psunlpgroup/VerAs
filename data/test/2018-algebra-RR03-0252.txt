discussion and conclusion



the research question being investigated was what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? 

three experiments on string length, angle of release, and pendulum weight were carried out in order to determine which one(s) is/were a factor. 

figures 1 and 2 both show a positive, linear relationship between the string length and pendulum period. a claim can be made that increasing a pendulum’s string length is increases the period of a pendulum. both figures 1 and 2 show an overlapping of error bars in each graph when using the equivalency criterion, meaning a claim can be made with 95% confidence that the measurements made and the true value may be the same.

in figure 3, the slope of the line is more than the slope of the line in figure 4. there is a linear relationship in figures 3 and 4. a claim can be made that increasing the angle a pendulum is released at increase the period of the pendulum. when applying the equivalency criterion to the error bars seen in figures 3 and 4, there is an overlap between the bars in each graph. a claim can be made with 95% confidence that the data values and the true value may be the same.

in figure 5, the trendline between the weight of the pendulum and the pendulum stays constant and actually slopes downwards. this trend is not a clear as those seen in figures 1-4. a claim can be made that changing the pendulum’s weight does not affect the period of the pendulum. when taking into consideration the equivalecy criterion and applying it to the error bars, an overlap of error bars is seen in the graph. a claim can be made with 95% confidence that the experimental values and the true values may be the same.

 the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is is  $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ the mathematical model was produced from figure 2 data resulting in the equation $y=0.3681 x^{0.471}$ when applying power as the trendline for the graph. when comparing experimental values from figure 2 to the theoretical values from mathematical model, they are about the same. 

random errors present were releasing the pendulum from a 90° angle as a control variable and the period of the pendulum when using a stopwatch. these were reduced by lowering the angle of release to 20° and taking multiple readings of the pendulum period and taking the average of those values. systematic errors present were the calibration of the stopwatch, pendulum weights not being exactly 50g or 20g, the photogate only reading to the 10ths place and not the intended 100th’s place, and having to stop and start the photogate to take a measurement. the calibration error was reduced by eliminating the use of a stop watch and replacing it with a photogate. individually weighing each pendulum weight and using the weights closest to the true value would improve accuracy and  reduce error. the photogate errors could be reduced in the future by ensuring the photogate program is properly set up before taking data, such as using the correct number of significant figures for the time and modifying settings.

constraints in this experiments are time, sufficient data, and environment. part of the experimental process is taken up by lecture, checkpoints, and only a 2 hour window to carry it out. lack of time can mean rushing to complete a task and glossing over small but important details. only having 2 hours can mean not being able to take multiple trials of an experiment and having to deal with one trial. relying on the results of one trial limits generalizability because there could be random and systematic errors affecting it. by taking multiple trials, sufficient data is collected and hopefully the errors are reduced. the environment the experiment takes place in isn’t controlled. in the instance of the lab from week 2, gathering data was challenging at times because of the close proximity to the other students. for example, when recording the pendulum period of a string with a length of 50 inches, that required a larger space for data collection. however, other classmates who were carrying out the same procedure were also spread out, limiting the mobility range.
