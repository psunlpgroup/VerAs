conclusion:
So, after this was there a correlation between mass and period? The answer is that, there is no correlation between mass of the pendulum and the period. This can be seen in the collected data when the mass changed, and the period did not. Therefore, our error bars come to only .022675 which is extremely small and fits perfectly on the trendline, and you can tell that the mass does not affect the period simply because the data points along the trend line are inconsistent and are oscillating around it.
Was there a correlation between length of the string and period? Yes, there was a direct correlation with period. As the values for the string length increased, the values for the period also increased at a linear rate. This can be seen if we look at how the data points consistently are above the previous data points, and how the error bars move upwards along the increasing trend line. You can also see how the data points in this graph are very consistent while the data points from the other two graphs are random and inconsistent.
Was there a correlation between the angle of release and the period after the experiment? No, there was no correlation between the two variables. This can be seen when the angles between 10 and 90 change, the period for those angles stays relatively the same. You can also see that there is no correlation between the angle of release and period for the uncertainty is extremely low, and the data points on the graph oscillate around the nearly horizontal trend line to it. These observations are also very similar to the data and graph for the Mass VS Period experiment, which also had no correlation.
To prove the theoretical equation, we needed to grab accurate values from the independent variables that had a correlation with the period, and we had to find an average standard deviation of the equation. We found the accurate values by using a photogate instead of a stopwatch, and we found the average standard deviation through multiple tests with only control variables.
Since the original equation “$T=\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$ solves for T using 2pi and g. It allows us to convert “$T=2pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$ to T is 2.0061*(L)­­0.5. This equation is 2.0061*(L)0.5 is extremely close to our own practical equation, $T = 2.1026 L^{0.426}$. Since they are so similar, one can say that the theoretical equation is proven to be true since the measured values would only get closer to the theoretical equation if we were to more accurately measure them.
	When we were collecting data, we ended up having a lot of random errors to account for. Some of these were due to improper timing with a stopwatch due to human error, and the length of the string changing due to the force of the weight pulling on the stand. So, to correct these and lower our uncertainty, we had ended up using two stop watches instead of one to get the average period between the two sources. This simple change minimized the number of extremes we had due to human error. We also eventually changed our timing system to a photogate and a program that measured the period to the ten thousandth of a second. This change also fixed any systematic error that could have been occurring from the less accurate count of the stopwatch. For any other random errors, we would have liked to use a device that would automatically measure and send out the exact length of the string asked rather than rely on a tape measure, and possibly a simple catch and release system could have been setup to maximize the tests where we changed the angle and mass of the experiment. However, some of these were impossible because the constraints of the project didn’t allow for this. Some of the major constraints were is  having to use a tape measure for the length of the string, not having and even surface for the protractor to rest upon, having a scale that only measure to the 10th of a gram, and not having enough time to order or create some of these mechanisms that would have yielded better data.
