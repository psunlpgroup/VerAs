discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system (lab 05) as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model (lab 06).

the first and second experiments were designed to help us create mathematical models for two different variables of potential ways that the acceleration of a frictionless system could be changed.  by creating only one independent variable and keeping everything else controlled, we were able to take measurements of velocity vs time and use the slope of that to output an acceleration for each trail and eventually all our trails were combined into a graph.  this graph was matched with a best fit line which was determined to be our mathematical model.  during the third experiment we used the same method that we used in the first experiment in order to create a mathematical model, but this time we created three different models from three different sets of data that were all taken over the same force vs acceleration variables.  in this experiment we used extra magnets to cause different amounts of friction which acted as systematic error.  the y intercept constant accounts for the potential slight slope of the of the air track in the equations for the experiments.  the x stands for the force in experiments one and three and the mass in experiment two.  the y value in all three experiments stands for the acceleration that was calculated with the velocity vs time graph.



this group (group 2) did the same test as us for lab 06, where they altered the magnets on top of the cart in order to see how low, medium, and high friction between the cart and the acceleration affected the mathematical models that were produced.  this groups models do a great job of showing that in lab 06 it was all about understanding the effect that systematic error may have on the outputted mathematical models.  as you can see, their models all share very similar or the same slopes and are just shifted up and down to represent the different systematic error that occurred.  by looking at how they labeled their variables, you can see that they also agreed that the y value is equal to the acceleration of the system, which agrees with the statement our group made.
this group, group 5 measured the change that occurs in their mathematical models when the tilt of the air track is increased.  they found out that as the air track is increased, the only variable that has a major change is the y intercept.  this supports the theory that the y intercept correlates to the slope of the air track.  it also further shows us that the graph is shifted up and down due to systematic error, yet the slope remains the same.

some errors that may have occurred that would have affected the data that we collected are the unwanted addition of friction that was only present when there was a certain amount of weight atop our car.  we noticed that when we exceeded a certain mass on the top of our cart that our cart began to rub with the air track which caused a linear trend to appear on lab 2 instead of the wanted exponential curve.  there was also the more obvious addition of friction in lab 06 where we created our own systematic error to show the importance that the lab setting can have.  some potential random errors that could have occurred are that we maybe didn’t start the cart from the exact same point every time which could have caused a slightly different acceleration to be recorded.  for the errors that we noticed the only thing that was done was to make sure that someone verified that the cart was on the same spot every time and the starting location was recorded so we knew that it was in the correct position.  in terms of the unwanted friction that came along with the added mass, the best thing that could be done next time is to make sure that there is enough air flow onto the track to negate any possible rubbing between the cart and the track no matter what weight is added.

some possible constraints that could limit the generalizability of our results are the fact that not everyone’s air track will have the same friction when there is a certain weight added.   this could lead to people replicating the experiment exactly like we did, but they would end up getting different results.  another potential constraint would be the fact that our air track was not exactly level and the cart moved on its own when the air flow was turned on because of this small tilt.  when others try to replicate this experiment, they may see that their track is completely level with the ground and does not cause any unwanted movement of the cart.

our experimental models are consistent with newtons second law because our models were both created with respect to three main variables is  force, mass, and acceleration.  we obtained our first model by using a constant mass and measuring the change that the force has on the acceleration.  the second model was the same, but it had a constant force and we saw the effect that the mass had on the acceleration.

theoretical equations discussion is 	

the theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$.this equation can be supported by the experimental mathematical model $a = c1 w + c2$ due to the fact that this equation is derived by taking measurements based on the force and mass of the system that outputted the acceleration.  that is why you are able to substitute the mathematical model for the acceleration of a system.  a further enhanced version of the theoretical equation is 

$a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$.  this is a better theoretical equation because it relates all the same aspects, which is why it can be substituted, but it also includes the extra forces that are necessary to fit the parameters such as the fext.

i predict that if a heavier string were used that it would cause a larger mass to be used as the mass of the system would include not only the hanging force, but also the mass of the string which would cause a different acceleration due to the now larger mass.  the acceleration would end up decreasing as the formula is $\frac{f}{m_{sys}}= a$ and msys is now larger.
