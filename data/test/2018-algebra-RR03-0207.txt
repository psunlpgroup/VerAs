discussion and conclusion

	the research question that was being investigated in this series of labs was to determine the variables that impact the period of a pendulum for small swings. the three experiments that were conducted each tested a variable that could be a possible contributor to the variation in the length of a period of a pendulum. the experiment that was testing the angle of release showed that there was no correlation between the angle of release and the length of the period. in figure 1 the points are all in line with each other and all the error bars overlap which indicates that the true value for all the measurements is most likely in that range. the experiment that was testing the mass showed that there was no correlation between the mass and the period length. in figure 2 the points are slightly scattered and the error bars all overlap indicating that they all most likely have true values in the same range. the experiment that was testing the impact of the length of the string shows that when the string length is increased the period length also increases. this can be seen in figure 3. the points all have distinct y values or period lengths and the error bars do not overlap which indicates that the true value for each of these points is unique.

	the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is is 



all the data collected in this lab agrees with this model. in this model, the angle of release and the mass are not accounted for because they do not impact the period. this is consistent with the findings of this lab. the string length is included in the equation and when the string length increases the period, t, will increase as well. this is consistent with the results of the test where the string length was changed. in figure 3 the curve fit is a polynomial instead of a linear fit. a polynomial fit was necessary because according to the mathematical model the relationship between string length and period is not liner, but rather polynomial.

	one source of random error or two-sided error that was present in these experiments is inconsistent timing. the first two experiments were timed with a stopwatch which could’ve been started or stopped at the wrong time. this error was reduced by performing multiple trials and taking an average of those trials. this error could be further reduced by taking an even greater number of trials or by using a photogate to get more precise measurements. there were not any known sources of systematic error, but it could be present due to faulty or uncalibrated equipment. if any of the equipment was faulty or uncalibrated the data would be skewed to one side consistently and taking more trials wouldn’t help to correct the error. one major constraint that may limit the generalization of these results is gravity. if this were performed on a different planet different results may have been obtained. another constraint of this experiment was the specific set up. other labs may have similar equipment, but it probably is not the exact same. this could impact the results that would be obtained.
