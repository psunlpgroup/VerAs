discussion and conclusion



throughout the experiment, the tested variables were used to answer a research question is  how does the change in applied force change the acceleration of the system? with that question in mind, the experiment was set up to test two variables, applied force and acceleration of a system. the data received is shown above in tables and figures. the resulting data showed a linear best fit trend line with a high r^2 value of 0.9972; the equation of the line was $y=5.0471 x + 0.0106$. the trend shows that there is a linear correlation between increasing applied force and acceleration of a system. the equation of the model given by the experimental data was used to compare with a theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m}$. the number 5.0471x would equal f/m, which would leave he 0.0106 for an additional force. because the force is positive, it means the acceleration is larger than it would be based off of the theoretical model. this force could possibly come from the increasing string mass pulling the sled as it moves given that the model requires a string with no mass (which is not possible). when imputing the data into the two equations they come out to be very similar. the results in group four and three were both similar to the results of this experiment; however one of the groups had a negative outside force instead of a positive. this positive force could be a result of a frictional force being applied to the sled during movement. possible errors in this experiment are limited to random errors, because the experimental model is very similar to the theoretical. those random errors could be due in the measurements taken for the two variables being used. incorrect measurement for weights or calculations are also possible errors in this experiment.
