discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab is to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model.

each experiment led to these mathematical models by plotting the data we collected into excel and finding the equation of the line. the slope indicates a rate of change of the data and the y-intercept is the other acceleration generated by the cart, air resistance, and other external factors that were almost negligible, but they still appear in the model.

group #1 

group #4

both of these groups’ mathematical models correlate with ours because as the friction force increases the c2 value increases. in turn this will make the acceleration value decrease.

the only potential error with this lab would be that the masses could be slightly off. this would be a systematic error because that may offset everything else. there was nothing done to reduce this and there most likely is not anything you can do besides way the bob and make sure it is the weight it should be.

the constraint with this lab was the time given for lab 05. if  there was more time to for each group to work the everyone would have not been rushed to complete their experiments. this could lead to inaccurate results.

newton’s second law is consistent with our mathematical model because the force and acceleration in our model have a direct relationship. the 2.861 slope in our equation indicates the rate of change as the applied force increase, the acceleration increases.
