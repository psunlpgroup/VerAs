discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this experiment was to investigate how the acceleration of s system changes when the applied force changes. this was accomplished by setting up a cart system where the mass remained constant but the force acting upon the cart changed through each trial. for each trial, the acceleration was measured. table 1 shows the data that was collected from this experiment showing a direct relationship between the applied force(n) and the acceleration of the system(m/s^2). figure 1 shows the graphical relationship between the applied force and the acceleration of the system. the graph shows a positive correlation between the two and the best fit line came out to be  $y=0.0045 x+.0511$ with an r^2 value of .99494 showing that the line fits the data very well. this linear line graph tells us that our mathematical model for the experiment was $y=0.0045 x+0.0511$. the theoretical equation for this lab (negligible to friction) is $f=m a$ of the system. this is related to newton’s second law equation $f=m a$. this is similar to our mathematical model of $a=c1 w+c2$. the theoretical model states that the acceleration should be equal to the force/mass and compared to our mathematical model this is consistent. when the force is 1, $0.0045=\frac{1}{m}$ which provides the slope for the graph and tells where mass plays a role in the relationship. in this particular theoretical model though it would indicate that the system would have to be frictionless for the force to be directly proportional to the mass. in this system however, friction was present. this would provide a theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m_{system}}+ \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{system}}$ where the f(ext) is the force of friction. this lines up perfectly with the experimental mathematical model of .0045x+.0511. the .0045x is the slope of the graph multiplied by the force(x). the .0511 is the force of friction that acts upon the system. when plugging in the force to this equation the acceleration is given (y).

if the string holding the cart had a mass than the acceleration would remain uniform because even though the mass is going to be larger, it is still going to remain constant and unchanging so the acceleration would remain uniform it just would possibly be less than it was before due to the higher mass. this is true because of newton’s second law $f=m a$. 

	random and systematic error could have taken place during this lab. some systematic errors that could have taken place were that the triple mass balance may not have been properly calibrated, the bobs used on the cart may not have been the same weight, and the track and cart may not be even to allow flow without friction. in the future, these could be reduced by checking to make sure the balance is calibrated before measuring the mass. also, weighing each bob individually instead of using the mass of just one could have reduced some error. some random error that could have taken place would be not properly setting up the system causing measurements to be off. this could be prevented by taking proper time to set the system up correctly for the best data results. some constraints of the experiment could have been not being able to properly test the effect of gravity on the system. this could affect the generizability of the results because the force of gravity may have some extra effect on the system that was not accounted for. 

experimental data from (bryant,et all) is consistent with the data that our group found. their mathematical model was $y=0.005 x-0.017$ which is similar to our mathematical model. theirs shows the force of friction and is representative of the theoretical model $f=m a$. experimental data from the red group is also consistent with the data that we collected. their mathematical model formed a linear relationship and was $y=4.2102 x + 0.0566$. their slope was a higher number because they measured their mass in grams and we measured ours in kg.
