conclusion:
	The idea being investigated in this experiment is; what impacts the period time of a pendulum. There was a total of three factors being used to measure the period time of a pendulum. When changing one independent variable at a time it is important to keep the other two variables constant so the results are not affected. The experimental design is shown in Table 1 for the first variable, the mass that is attached to the pendulum. In this part of the experiment, the mass was increase in intervals of 40g, starting at 50g and ending at 210g. The string length was held constant throughout all five trials at 30cm, and the angle of release was also held constant at 30. It is shown in Figure 1 that there was not a significant difference in the time of a period while the mass attached was increased. The prediction and hypothesis were correct for this first part of the experiment; there was no correlation between the mass and the time of the period.
	The next part of this experiment consisted of the same process, but the string length was the independent variable that was being changed in each trial. The string lengths used were 15cm, 51cm, 79cm, 100cm, and 136cm. The variables that were held at a constant in this part were the mass, which was 110g, and the angle of release, which was 30 again. Figure 2 shows that there was a positive correlation between the string length and the time of the period. The line of best fit is linear with a positive slope. This positive correlation proves that the hypothesis and prediction that was made was correct. The conclusion can be made that the string length does impact the period time of a pendulum.
	The final part of this experiment was, once again, the same process but the last variable to be investigated was used is  the angle of release. Starting at 5 there were a total of five trials is  10, 15, 20, and 30. According to figure 3, there is very slight positive correlation between the angle of release and the period time. It was discovered that the angle does impact the period time, but in our experiment, it was only slightly. So slight that there was not enough evidence to say that it does effect the time of the period. Better data could have been acquired if more angles were used and included larger angles. The angle of release does effect the time of a period because the larger the angle is means the more distance the pendulum has to travel to make a full period, therefore would take more time to get there.
	There is a theoretical mathematic equation of a pendulum that can be used to determine the actual time of a period. This equation can be written as . The variable “T” is the period time, and the variable “L” is the length of the string, in meters so the values must be converted. Plugging in the values used for string length for “L” the values for “T” are very similar to the period times obtained from the experiment. For example is  . The period time obtained for the 136cm/1.36m string length was 2.30s. This obtained value is very close to the theoretical value from the equation. The difference in the value comes from the random human error that occurred in this experiment.
	The values acquired in this experiment are not perfect. Random error is the reason for the variation in values throughout each part of this experiment. For each part, there were five trials conducted. All three members of the group used a stopwatch to time the period of the pendulum. All three times were averaged and used as the data for the graphs. No human can perfectly time the period without a little variation each time. The standard deviation was determined to be 0.071. This value was acquired by keeping all three variables constant and doing ten more separate trials. The data from those ten trials were used to calculate the standard deviation. The error bars of figures 1, 2, and 3 represent the standard deviation. Using the stopwatches accounts for an aspect of random error. This can be reduced by getting more trials or by using a photogate that can time the period more accurate than a human. Another source of error could involve the angle of release. This source could be reduced by focusing more on getting the perfect angle before dropping the mass. Also, making sure there is no slack in the string before the drop would help.
	A factor that could affect the result would be the air resistance present. In this experiment, the resistance was so little that it was considered negligible. Under perfect circumstances this experiment could be done in an area that has no air, which is nearly impossible here on Earth.
