conclusion:
 the research question being asked in this lab was “what impacts the number of swings a pendulum has in a given period?”

in each of the three experiments, the research question was answered by different claims. one of our hypotheses was that the increasing length of the string would affect the number of swings. in table 5 specifically, we can see there is a positive correlation between the length of the strings versus the time. as we increased the length of the string, we found that the time it took to complete a period also increased. we were confident with our measurements because we did them multiple times, so the error bars were too small to see in this graph. in table 3, we had predicted that the mass would not have affected the time it took for the period to increase/decrease. this claim was correct because there is a horizontal slope, which indicates there is no change. since these numbers may not be 100% accurate, we have error bars in this graph. finally, our last prediction consisted of the angle of release versus the period. we predicted that the angle of release had no affect on the time of the period. we were correct because table 2 shows a horizontal slope, which indicates no change of how the angle can increase/decrease the period. 

 the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum $t=2$. the t represents the time it takes for the pendulum to complete a period. referring to table 5 in this instance, we can see that the power curve represents something crucial; the longer the length of the rope, the more time it takes for the pendulum to complete a period. gravity has an affect on these data points because since the rope is longer in some of the cases, the force of gravity will make the time it takes for it to complete a period will be longer. the slope of the line is related to time by the increments of 2. since our  value is .9961, we can determine that our data matches up with the theoretical model. the closer the r value is to one, the more accurate the data. we thought the graph would be a linear curve. however, the data shows that there is a power curve. this indicates that as the length of the rope increases, so does the time it takes to complete a period. some factors that were not included in the model were angle and the mass being held. this is because the angle of release and the mass of the object being held down by the pendulum do not affect the time it takes to complete a period. 

 by looking at the various tables posted above, there is an argument that there was random error involved. for example, in table 1, after the third point there is a significant jump in the slope. this may have been caused by not measuring the length of the rope correctly. to fix this, we can measure the rope several times, then take the average length to ensure a correct length was chosen. another source of random error we may have had was the angle of release throughout the various tables. excluding table 2, all of the angles in the other tables was held at a constant 20 degrees. the source of error may have been when we were measuring the angle. since the length of the string was long in some cases, the angle of release may have been 20 at the top. however, if the string was not held in a straight line with the angle, the object truly did not start at 20 degrees, which would indicate error. in order to fix this, we can align the string in a direct straight line with the angle to prevent whiplash, which would help without data. we had noticed this as we had proceeded with the experiment, so we changed this and yielded better results.

 in this experiment, there was a difference among different tables on how we measured the time it took to measure the period. for tables 1-4, we had to measure the time by hand (stopwatch). this may have been a constraint because we were not able to use the sensor given in table 5. we were also held to a constraint of having our angles be below 20 degrees. if the angles we had used in the experiment were larger than 20 degrees, it may have made our data be incorrect. another constraint we had was having the mass at a constant 150 grams. if it was larger than 150 grams, it would not affect the time it takes to complete a period, but it may have an affect on the slack of string to start out with, which may make the data incorrect. since the data may or may not have been consistent, the time represented on the tables may have been a little fast or a little slow depending on when the timer was used. it may affect the slope of the graph and where the points may lie. using the stopwatch may have yielded more error because it can be harder to get the exact time at which the object stopped. however, having the sensor in the last table gave us really consistent data, which may have helped us. the sensor is more accurate because it has a more precise time at which the period truly ended.
