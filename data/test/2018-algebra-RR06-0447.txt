			discussion and conclusion

the research question in labs 05 and 06 regarding newton’s law part i and ii was whether acceleration will change if the force applied on an object changes. in experiment 06, the hanging weight was used as the independent variable, and since force equals mass times acceleration, the weight/mass are directly proportional to force. this would mean that as the independent variable increased (mass) so would force, which would essentially increase acceleration of an object if our research question proved testable. it was shown through testing that as the weight of the object increased, so did the acceleration, so we reject the null hypothesis. data provided by the other group confirms our findings. as can be seen from the other group, as the mass of their object increased, so did their acceleration. this supports our claim because we reached the conclusion that as mass increases so does the acceleration, and with the other groups graph, there is an linear increase showing a positive correlation between mass and acceleration. error bars are the graphical representation of the variability of data and is used on graphs to indicate the error of uncertainty in recorded measurements. error bars communicate the reliability of the mean value as a representative number for the data aka, how accurately the mean value represents the data. this means smaller sd bars, more reliable, larger sd bars, less reliable. as can be seen with lab 05, the error bars are quite hard to see meaning that the results recorded are more likely to be significantly different. in lab 06, due to the accuracy of the instruments used, the error bars are too small to even be seen on the graph, which also indicated a high likelihood of a significant difference. to find uncertainty, we needed the equation given to us in excel which will be referred to as the fit equation. add the ave. value of each trial in the equation, then add the trial. lastly you will divide by the total number of trials and your answer will be your uncertainty


to calculate the percent yield, we used the theoretical which was given to us, over the actual, which we calculated in class, multiplied by 100. then we subtracted that number from 100 to find out how close our results were to 0. this is because the closer our answer is to zero, the more accurate it is.

the enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration would just be a more accurate equation which accounts for friction and is regarded as c. in a single force system, you would only account for friction in the x in one situation, however for the acceleration of a system by more than one force will account for friction in both of the given forces. the mathematical experimental modes both  support the theoretical model because in both you can see a positive linear relationship in both the acceleration and applied force.  an example can be shown below.

the experimental model was performed to check our accuracy of how we performed the 

experiment, and it happened to support the theoretical model as can be seen by the fact that our group was only 3% off from the correct number. the experimental model simply tested the experiment and where as our acceleration was significantly close to the theoretical model, it proved to support our findings and the original theoretical model. the enhanced theoretical equation is solved above. 

if a heavy string connected to a weight that would add more mass thus increasing the weight total weight because you must account also for the weight of the object, thus increasing the weight, thus increasing the acceleration even more. random errors would be anything we could not detect and/or change so an example would be air resistance as the string moved, naturally that would take away from the acceleration of the object, but there would be no way to remove air resistance unless we were in a vacuum. similarly, some systematic errors would be a problem with the online technology used and/or the machine. this would have caused inaccuracy but precision. constraints would be that our instruments used could only be accurate to a certain degree of scientific certainty, but we cannot control that. another constraint is that our given mass could only be big up to a certain point, if it’s too big, the force calculated would be too large, skewing the inaccuracy of our data.
