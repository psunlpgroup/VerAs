discussion and conclusion: 

the research question in this lab was to determine how the applied force impacts the acceleration of a system. the only factor tested in this experiment was applied force to the system by changing the weight of bobbers hanging off the system because force is equal to acceleration (-9.8m/s^2) multiplied by the mass of the bobbers. figures 1 and 2 show that there is a linear relationship between the acceleration of a system and applied force on a system. this means that as the applied force increases, the acceleration of the system increases. tables 2 and 3 also show that increasing the mass of the handing bobbers increases the acceleration of the system due to their linear relationship. figure 3 and table 4 show that there is a power relationship between acceleration and the applied force of the system. a power relationship means that as the applied force of a system and the acceleration of a system are exponentially related. the mass of the hanging bobbers can be converted to the force applied on the system by multiplying the mass by 9.8m/s^2. the fact that the horizontal and vertical error bars do not overlap over a period of time in figure 1 confirms the linear relationship between the acceleration and applied force.  the mathematical model for the acceleration of the system for figure 1 and table 2 is $y=44.343 x + 0.017$ where y equals the acceleration and x equals the applied force. the mathematical model for acceleration for the system for figure 2 and table 3 is $y=5.1095 x - 0.029$. the mathematical model for acceleration for the system for figure 3 and table 4 is $y=4.8085 x^{1.0}$ where y equals the acceleration and x equals the applied force. the theoretical model ($a=\frac{f_{app}}{m}$) relates to the actual model ($a=c1 w+c2$) for all linear equations because they both have slopes that are equal to fapp/m. the only difference between the actual and theoretical models is that the actual models take into account external or environmental forces, but the theoretical model does not. these forces can include friction, tension and many more. reasons why the data in figure 3 and table 4 have an exponential relationship and not a linear relationship can be attributed to experimental error. systematic errors include incorrectly weighing the mass of the system and/or bobbers, applying a force to the system when releasing the block, and the acceleration sensor not being properly calibrated. random errors include vibrations from moving chairs and wind from people moving that impact the velocity of the system. systematic errors can be corrected by actually fixing what is wrong with the experiment. random errors can be reduced by taking the average of the collected data, taking multiple measurements, and perfecting the measurement technique. the acceleration for a heavy string connecting the hanging weight with the cart would produce results with higher accelerations. this would occur due to an increase in weight that would increase the applied force on the system. constraints in this experiment include not having more weight to increase the applied force on the system. this is a possible constraint because a larger amount of data could not be obtained.
