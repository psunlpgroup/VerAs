discussion and conclusion

	the purpose of this lab was to create mathematical models to describe how a real system works while including each factor that will be tested. for the all 3 experiments, they were graphed in google docs and displayed an equation which gave us our mathematical models. the positive constants in the model from the first factor tested confirms our prediction that as the force applied increases the acceleration of the system increases. the negative constant that is multiplied by the m1 with the total being added to a positive constant confirms our initial prediction that as the m1 mass increases the acceleration of the system decreases shown in the factor 2 graph. the third graph shows that our prediction was correct that increasing the numerical value of the kinetic friction would decrease the numerical values of our model. below are 2 pictures of other groups’ findings. the red lettering group tested how the incline of the track would affect the numerical values. their findings showed that as the angle is decreased the values of both numerical values in their model increased.  the green lettering group tested the same hypothesis as us. this helped our confidence in our findings due to them having the same outcome. when using the formula for newton's second law for lab 06 we attempted to calculate a value for c1 and obtained a value of -115.158, which differs from the number in our model by a lot. when using the formula for newton’s second law we attempted to calculate a value for the f and got a value of -159.494n which is a big difference from the expected value of 348.9n. one constraint this lab had like the previous lab was time. we could have figured out certain problems we came across if we had enough time. instead we had to work with what we had.
