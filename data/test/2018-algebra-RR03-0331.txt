discussion and conclusion:

what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? we determined the iv string length impacts the period of a pendulum. in the first experiment ran, our hypothesis and our prediction were proven correct, there is a relationship between the period of a pendulum and the length of the string. our predictions were also correct, having a longer string increases the period of a pendulum. however, our hypothesis and predictions for our second and third experiments were proven incorrect. the mass of the pendulum and the angle of release have no effect on the period of the pendulum. the small r2 values for the second and third experiment and the high value for the first experiment further support this. for the second experiment we could have reduced some random error by taking several measurements of the mass of the pendulum and averaging those to get a more precise reading. having proper, whole, working equipment is critical when reducing systematic errors, our protractor was broken. also, having 3 separate people time trials made for a random error. eventually we were able to get synced up with our start and stop times, but there was a noticeable difference between the two. instead we could have one person run all the trials three separate times and average them to reduce random error. in order to get more precise results, we constrained the angle of release to less than 30Â°. having a larger angle of release allows for more error. if the pendulum has any oscillation it will be magnified, increasing the time of the period and skewing the results we are collecting. in order to calculate the theoretical period of a pendulum we use the equation . you can derive an equation from it. $y=0.2 x^{0.05}$. the equation given on the graph of the first experiment come close to this number, further proving the relationship between the period of a pendulum and the length of its string. since we were able to determine a relationship between the pendulum and string length, we tested our hypothesis further. for experiment fourth we kept all variables the same and ran 10 trials to assess our uncertainty. this helps us to determine if there are any random or systematic errors we could encounter. for our fifth experiment we used a photogate to measure the relationship period of the pendulum and string length. our r2 value and the equation on the graph are almost equal to that of the theoretical equation and the desired r2 value of 1, further proving the relationship between string length and the period of a pendulum.
