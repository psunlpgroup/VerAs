Discussion and Conclusion 
After applying the design of experiment and mathematical and theoretical model. It can be observed the that graph 1 agree with the theoretical model because the increase of mass also increases the acceleration. $F=M A$. As mass increases acceleration or force increases. When comparing the two models, the results of the data were very similar as it can be seen in the data table 1. $F=M A$ and $M G=M A$. Further in the experiment, it was observed that there were some variables or forces like gravity or frictional forces that might have impacted the investigation, such as scale error, and air track being on longer that it should have. Our resulting model was $y=0.503 x-0.0221$. In conclusion if the mass is increased on the hanging side, the cart will undergo with uniformed acceleration because mass and acceleration are in linear relation, for that reason as one increases, the other increases proportionately.

Above we can see the two group tables figure 1 and figure 2 where group 1 model was $y=0.0053 x-0.0306$ (Group 1, 2018) While group 5 was Group 5’s is $y=0.0045 x$ so $y=0.0699$ (Group 5, 2018). From the findings, we know that y represents the acceleration and x is a match to force. Each of these models are different from the model that was designed in the result of the experiment as well as each other. The frictional force within the system is the only thing similar among all the experiments. Friction is the other force in the experiment, it is the amount subtracted in the actual mathematical model as well in the theoretical one. M is mass (the mass of the system is identical in all bobbing’s and cart). Therefore, a string without a mass will not add up to the total mass of the entire system. It will not increase as the hanging mass pulls down and will not contribute to the increase acceleration. 
In conclusion, the constrains of the experiments can be resume as the limited number of trials which can be easily enhanced by adding more bobbing’s to the experiment. The second limitation encountered was the frequency of each trial. If the trials are repeated more than once, we will get a more accurate result. And lastly, we could have used more than one system mass .
