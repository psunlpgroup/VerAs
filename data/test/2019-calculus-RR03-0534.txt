Discussion and Conclusion:
The research question was: What factors affect the period of a pendulum. After testing mass as the independent variable we were able to determine that mass does not affect the time of each period. The time measured at different masses were very similar and on the graph the error bars overlapped each other showing that the changes in time were caused by random error. The times measured were not affected by different angles, the times measured at different angles were also very similar and accounted for by  the error bars overlapping. The times measured was affected by the length of the pendulum, there was a linear relationship and error bars did not overlap. The equation we got for the graph of time vs length was is  tim$e=0.0153 cm l + 0.6188$ . Our equation was similar to those of our classmates that we compared with and was linear like the theoretical model. Possible random errors in the experiment were is  lack of accuracy of stop watches and human error when using stop watches which was eliminated by using the photogate; how the pendulum was dropped, we had the same person drop it each time to make it consistent, have some sort of mechanical device to drop it would decrease this error; wind in the room, which could be reduced by turning of all vents and closing all doors and windows, the stability of the mount, which could be reduced by using a stringer and heavier mount; human error when measuring angle, which could be made more accurate by using a mechanical device that hold and releases the pendulum at a specific angle; and random error from the precision of the tape measure and human error when measuring the pendulum length, this could be reduced by using more precise tape measures. All random error can also be reduced by repeating the trials multiple times. Constraints in the experiment were the precision of the equipment and time. With better equipment we could get more precise results and with more time we would be able to do a lot more trials which would dramatically decrease the random error in the experiment.
