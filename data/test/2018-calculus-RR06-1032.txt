conclusion.

however, there was another group that had data that differed by a considerably large amount.
since this group decided to use actual mass we must define the mass of one bobber which is roughly equivalent to 0.0040 kg. if we convert their trail 1 force and trail 7 force, we are left with the mass for trial 1 being 0.0048kg and trial 8 being .0384 kg. this means that their trail 1 most likely had 1 bobber on it, and their trial 7 most likely had 7 bobbers on it. so, when comparing our trial 1 with theirs we end up having a .007 m/s^2 difference, and their trial 7 with our trial 8 yields us a 0.31 m/s^2 difference. this gives us an overall uncertainty of 0.1585. this uncertainty is higher when compared to the .11405 uncertainty from the last groups data. overall, due to this it means that our data is pretty significantly different, but in the end data for the relationship with the force of the hanging mass still supports our claim.
when we look at our graph again we find that the experimental mathematical model is equivalent to $a=5.1474 x - 0.0641$
this experimental model differs from the actual theoretical model by a decent amount. the theoretical model can be found when we solve for a in the equation $a = m f$. since the whole system is being pulled by the force of gravity on the hanging mass, it is safe to assume in the theoretical model that f is equivalent to mass * gravity. however, since we are solving for the acceleration of the system then we must make the mass equal to 1/mass of the system so $m =\frac{1}{0.1881}$. this causes the theoretical equation to come out to be $a =\frac{f}{0.1881}$ so $a = 5.316 f$. our experimental was 5.1474f – 0.0641. when comparing the two equations we can see how they differ, this most likely is due to the imperfect surface that we were running our tests on, along with the minute inaccuracy of the devices used for measurement, and the small force of friction that was on the pulley system. these inaccuracies contribute to the 5.1474 being different from the 5.316 and cause the experimental equation to have a starting value that is not 0. however, even though these differences can cause issues with larger masses, for our purposes we can safely assume that our theoretical model supports the theoretical model since they mostly have the same linear slope.
this theoretical equation works well with smaller masses and larger uncertainty’s, but what would we do if we had a small uncertainty of which we needed to get our acceleration to be. well, in lab 6 we were tasked to find the mass that would give us an acceleration of .421 +/- 0.100. using our experimental equation that was supported from the theoretical, we were able to create a more accurate theoretical equation that allowed us to solve for this issue. this equation just worked backwards from our original experimental equation- $a = 5.1474 f – 0.0641$ so  $a = \frac{f}{m} – 0.0641$. however, since we must account for imperfect frictional forces along with gravity we also ended up accounting for the difference between the 5.1474 and the 5.316 in both the experimental and theoretical is 0.9683. after accounting for this we were able to create a more accurate theoretical equation that considered outside forces such as friction.  $a = \frac{0.9683 9.81 m_h}{m_{total}} – 0.641$. since this equation is a combination of the theoretical and experimental, it allows us to get a more accurate equation that relies less on measured data and more on arithmetic while still considering outside forces.
if we were to add into the mix a heavy string rather than our normal string that we were using, then we must account for it in both the total mass and hanging mass. since the string is being accounted for both, then the acceleration in turn would increase as the total systems weight increased. if we look back on our equation, we can see that the quotient of the division would be multiplied by the larger mass before being divided by the total mass plus the extra weight of the string. this is turn will cause the acceleration to increase.
when it comes to the experiment there were many random errors that had caused our experimental equation to stretch further from the theoretical. some of these random errors were the amount of airflow riding under the object that was traveling, outside forces that pulled or pushed on the object upon release, air resistance from the hanging mass and system itself were some of the many random errors found in the experiment. some things that we could do in order to counteract some of these errors would be to have a release system that wouldn’t put any force on the system upon release, testing with the hanging mass in a vacuum seal so that there would be little to no air resistance upon it, and having a perfectly aligned air system that pushed an exact amount of air at an exact angle for every hole. however, some of these would be nice to do except the constraints of the experiment make it hard if not impossible to achieve some of these changes. some of these constraints were that we had to use the school’s machine, we had to use our hands for the release mechanism, there was no changing the way the air flow in the machine worked, and we had to use a photogate for measuring acceleration when we could’ve used something more accurate. these constraints are just some that stop us from being able to gain an accurate representation to the theoretical equation, but since the equipment works well enough it creates a general range for equations that are accepted for the assignment.
