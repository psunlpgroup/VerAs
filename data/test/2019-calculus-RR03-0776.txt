conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to answer our research question: “what factors impact the period of a pendulum for small angles?” we tested three separate factors, mass of the pendulum, the angle of release, and the length of string used. we accomplished this by testing each factor independently of the other. 
the first factor that i will discuss is the angle of release. the angle of release has no impact on the period of a pendulum for small angles. this can be proven by experimental data. the experimental design used to test the angle of release as the independent variable can be found in table 1. “experimental design to determine the impact angle of release has on period”. data was collected following this design and can be found in table 1.1. “data to determine the impact angle of release has on period”. note that data was collected and provided by group 1 in phys 2001l-007 19ss. these data points were plotted on a graph to determine if there is a correlation between the angle of release and the period of the pendulum. this graph is listed as figure 1. “graph of period vs angle”. error bars are included on the graph, the error bars represent the calculated uncertainty associated with the measuring techniques used to collect this data. if the error bars of two different data points overlap, a claim that the values are different cannot be made. referring to figure 1, we can see that the error bars for the data points collected from 5° to 20° all overlap, therefore we cannot interpret these values as different. the data points collected at 30° and 40° also have significantly overlapping error bars. it is due to this that we cannot claim these values are different. therefore we can claim that the angle of release does not affect the period of a pendulum for small angles.
the second factor that i will discuss is the mass of the pendulum. the mass of the pendulum has no impact on the period of a pendulum for small angles. this can be proven by experimental data. the experimental design used to test the mass of the pendulum as the independent variable can be found in table 2. “experimental design to determine the impact mass of a pendulum has on period.”  data was collected following this design and can be found in table 2.1 “data to determine the impact that mass of pendulum has on period.” these data points were plotted on a graph to determine if there is a correlation between the mass of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum. this graph is listed as figure 2 “graph of mass vs period”. error bars are included on the graph, the error bars represent the calculated uncertainty associated with the measuring techniques used to collect this data. if the error bars of two different data points overlap, a claim that the values are different cannot be made. referring to figure 1, we can see that the error bars for the data points collected from 90 grams to 250 grams overlap, thus we cannot claim these values are different. therefore we can claim that the mass of a pendulum does not affect the period of a pendulum for small angles.
the final factor that i will discuss is the length of string used. the experimental design used to test the length of string as the independent variable can be found in table 3. “experimental design to determine the impact that length of string has on period”. following this design, we collected and recorded data. this data can be found in table 3.1 “data to determine the impact that the length of string has on period”. this data was then plotted on a graph to help determine if there is a correlation between length of string and period of a pendulum. this graph is listed as figure 3 “graph of period vs length”. error bars are included on the graph, the error bars represent the uncertainty associated with the photogate used to collect this data. this value was provided in the lab. unlike the other two factors, the error bars in figure 3 have no overlap. this means that we can confidently claim that these values are all different. therefore we can claim that the length of string impacts the period of a pendulum. after determining that a correlation was present, we were able to create a mathematical model. 
this mathematical model is $y=1.0021011 x$ with an r2 value of r2 is .9996 (figure 3). in the model y is period in seconds and x is length in meters. the model was created by using curve fitting in microsoft excel. the accuracy, or how well the curve fits the data, is represented by the r2 value. the closer the r2 is to 1.0, the more accurate the curve fits the data. our r2 value of .9996 means that the mathematical model is almost perfectly represented by the data points. the theoretical model of the period of a pendulum is $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$     (t is period in seconds, l is  length of string in meter, and g is acceleration due to gravity [-9.8 m/s/s]). after some basic algebra, we get that     $t=2.0071 l^{0.5}$            we can support this theoretical model with our lab data due to the similarities between the theoretical model and our mathematical model. though we can not support the theoretical model with the other two factors (mass and angle of release) due to the lack of trend between the respective independent variable and the period of the pendulum. 
this lab was conducted under the constraint of small angles. this means that the results of this lab can only be applied to similar situations. this negatively impacts the generalizability of the results. another constraint we experienced was the gravitational constant of earth. these results would only apply to a pendulum here on earth. this also makes the results less generalizable. therefore, the results of this lab and the mathematical model that the results produced can only be used to predict the period of a pendulum with an angle of release equal or less than 20° on earth.
in this experiment, we had errors that produced uncertainties, they are listed below, along with ways to reduce them.
inconsistent measuring of period times due to human reaction speed (starting/stopping the stopwatch too late/early). this only applies to the experiments that tested mass and angle. this could be improved by using a photogate to record the period.
inconsistent drop of pendulum. when the pendulum is dropped it isn’t unlikely that the person who dropped it enacted some force on it, in either the positive or negative direction. this can be solved by mechanically releasing the pendulum allowing the drop to be the same every time.
although the photogate is more accurate than a human with a stopwatch, it still has a small amount of error. the only way to reduce this is to get a more accurate photogate, this still won’t remove all error though, only reduce it.
measuring the angle from the top of the pendulum as opposed to the center of mass. this can be solved by measuring from the center of mass. though it is likely it did not have a significant impact, as angle does not affect the period of the pendulum.
