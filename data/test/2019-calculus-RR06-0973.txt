conclusions-

the whole premise of both labs 5 and 6 where to analyze and form mathematical models that described the relationship between applied force and acceleration and to a further extent the effects of particular external stimuli; in the case of our group, we analyzed the effects of forward tilt on the relationship between acceleration and force.
for lab 5, two models were experimented and observed. beginning with the first model, students needed to analyze the relationship between the acceleration of the cart along the track verses the force of the weight of  . based upon model 1, a correlation between acceleration and force was made, in which acceleration is directly proportional to the force made by  , and from the best-fit line calculated in chart 1, the equation was evaluated. next, the slope was deduced to be the inverse of the mass of the whole system. although both  and  where changing throughout the experiment, the total mass of the system remained constant. the y-intercept would be later discovered to be the slope of the air track in lab 6, but for the purpose of lab 5, the value was thought to be due to an external stimulus. for the second experiment in lab 5, the relationship the acceleration of the cart on the track and the mass of  . from the data collected during the experiment, an inverse relationship between the acceleration and the mass of  , and the slope was hypothesized to be the mass of   as it remained constant throughout the whole experiment. 
for lab 6, model 1 was more extensively analyzed as students had to observe the effects of one of the following external factors is  forward tilt, backwards tilt, or friction. for this lab, the specific analyzation of the forward tilt of the relationship between acceleration and force was conducted. by testing at 3 varying slope heights, further observations about the mathematical models for the plots of acceleration verses force. beginning with the slopes from the three experiments, there seemed too little to know variation in the magnitude and direction of the slope, which indicates that the slope height had no effect on the value. furthermore, this validates previous claims that the slope is equal to the inverse of the mass of the system. however, the y-intercept change and positive correlation between the height of the slope and the value of the y-intercept was made; therefore, the y-intercept was concluded to be the height of the slope.   
if the force generated by  increases, then the acceleration of the system will increase as well.
conclusion of equation $a=2.87 x+0.261$
based upon the equation that best fit the data, the acceleration of the system is directly proportional to the force generated by  .
if the force generated by  increases, then the acceleration of the system will increase as well.

from team 6 there seemed have a similar analysis to ours where the magnets, which created a frictional force, impacted the equation of the relationship between acceleration and force in a similar manner. all of their mathematical models have very similar slopes to one another, indicating that the magnets had no effect on the slope of the graph. however and similarly, the added stimuli affected the y-intercept, which could possibly represent the force of friction caused by the magnets.
from team 2 they too had a similar outcome to both team 6 and our analysis of the mathematical models. once again, the slopes of each model had little variance and only their y-intercept changed. as the back tilt increased, so did the magnitude of the y-intercept. therefore, the y-intercept indicates the height of the back tilt.
although our mathematical models for lab 5 and 6 had -values of 1, which indicates a strong relationship between the independent and dependent variable, there were variances in the mathematical models that could have been caused by both random or systematic errors.
random errors that could have resulted in the variances of the slopes of the mathematical model varying include the mishandling of the testing-apparatus and/or inaccurate weighing of the  and  . if  was especially incorrectly weighed, the resulting force applied would have been incorrect skewing the data to the left if the mass weighed less than what was observed and vice versa for  weighing more. additionally, if the rotational motion sensor did not always rotate with the movement of the  due to slipping by the string would have resulted in a less steep slope. when releasing the cart, if the experimenter happened to push slightly forward on the cart, it would have resulted in a steeper slope, and a less steep slope would have been the result of the experimenter slightly pushing back on the cart.
systematic errors that could have resulted are fairly slim as the sample error of the rotational motion sensor was very low and any systematic error from the sensor would not have affected the slope of the graph. however, in the lab 5, systematic error occurred from a possible multitude of errors from a possible tilt in the air track or a lack of frictionless surface by the air track. the theoretical mathematical model for the first experiment in lab 5 should have had a y intercept of zero, but the calculated model had a y-intercept of 0.261. this could have been caused by a forward tilt in the track as it would explain the positive positioning of the intercept on the graph.

this model is very difficult to generalize as there have been many constraints placed in the labs that the mathematical models could only be used in theoretical descriptions. first of all, our mathematical models rely on the use of a fairly frictionless surface produced by the air track. additionally, the range of forces tested limit the generalizability of the experiment as in the real world there are many variances in the magnitude of forces. lastly, our models rely on particular set-up with a string that has very little stretch and is fairly weightless. 
with all the models of acceleration verses force, a simple representation of newton’s second law is formed as a direct positive relationship between the acceleration of the system and the force applied by  . additionally, the derivation of the acceleration from newton’s second law is that acceleration is equal to the net force times the inverse of the mass of the system, which also happened to be the constant discovered in our mathematical models.
