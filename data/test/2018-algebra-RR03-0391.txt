discussion: 

our overall research question was does changing the length of the pendulum string, mass of the bopper, and angle the bopper is released change the time it took the pendulum to make one full swing. in tables 4-6 for experiment 1, you can see our raw data. we made the mistake of not measuring the period of time, which caused a systematic error. however, we found out that the mass of the bopper does not affect the period of time. we thought the angel at which we dropped the bopper and length of the string would affect the period of time. as we learned in experiment 2, due to random error, the angle of the bopper being dropped does not affect the period of time. we added error bars to see the errors we had. the error bars were large because of random errors such as, hitting the table, mistiming, and not dropping at the right angles. in experiment 3, we used the photogate to eliminate the errors. after using photogate our error bar was so small you could barely see them. in table 7 and graph 4 you can see we got a r^2 value or .993. our theoretical mathematical model was exponential. in table 4 the line is slightly exponential. we tried other models but exponential gave us the best r^2 values. some constrains we had were not having enough time to do more trials. also, we couldâ€™ve used photogate from experiment 1 to help with the random timing error.
