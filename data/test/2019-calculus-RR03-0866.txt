conclusion and discussion

the tests conducted show that there is a positive correlation between length and the period of time it takes the pendulum to complete one full swing as seen in in figure 6 scatter plot. the data collected from the experiment supports this conclusion. there is also a positive correlation between friction and the period of time take to complete a swing. the more friction action upon the pendulum the longer a swing will be, this is supported by the tests and graphs outlined above.  the data collected shows no correlation between mass and length of time the pendulum takes to finish a period. tests may also be carried out with differing gravities and angle to test the correlation to the time taken to finish a period. these tests were carried out using a simulator therefore error is possible. the manual stopwatch provided by the simulator is an opportunity for human error when conducting this experiment. 

air resistance slightly affects the movement of the pendulum. the effects of air resistance on the pendulum could be removed by performing our experiments in a vacuum. additionally, the effects could be tested for by changing the shape of the masses on the end of the pendulum or by changing the material of the masses on the end of the pendulum. the same changes could also be made to the string of the pendulum. however, testing for these effects would require a highly accurate timing system. error that results from recording the amount of time during which the pendulum performs 10 oscillations is another factor that directly affects the result of this experiment. having more multiple students collect data, as the group did, helped limit the amount of error resulting from this, but it is not a perfect solution to the problem. another factor is the friction between the string of the pendulum and the metal bar to which it is attached. to determine the effect of this source of friction, the material of which the string is made, or the material of which the metal bar is made, could be modified.

a type of automated timing system would help in collecting more accurate results, if given the chance to repeat this experiment. this would completely remove the effect of human error in timing the period of oscillation of the pendulum. human error could also be removed in some sort of automated dropping system which would ensure that any unwanted rotation or velocity would not be imposed upon the pendulum.
this experiment was designed to identify and reduce the error in the first lab, this was achieved by taking multiple measurements under the same circumstances.


some error is introduced by having a person physically release the pendulum, as that person’s hand could move and introduce error into the angle of release.

another source of error (which also occurs as a result of a person releasing the pendulum) is that the pendulum tended to oscillate sideways in addition to its intended back-and-forth oscillations.

larger masses caused the metal bar which supported the pendulum to move slightly as the pendulum oscillated, which introduced error into the period of oscillation for some trials.

error is caused by human reaction time associated with properly timing the 10 oscillations of the pendulum. it takes 0.25 seconds for a person to respond to a visual stimulus. the random error in this situation is caused by the variances in reaction times for each trial.
air resistance and kinetic friction had a systematic effect on every trial, causing each oscillation of the pendulum to have a shorter period and a lower amplitude.

the stopwatches used to record the time only measured times to the nearest 1/100th of a second. therefore, recorded times could not be more accurate than to the nearest 1/100th of a second.

the protractor used to measure the angle of release only accurately measure to the nearest 0.5°, so angles could not be more accurate than this.

the tape measure used to measure the length of the string or the length of the pendulum is only accurate to the nearest millimeter, not allowing more accurate string lengths to be measured or recorded.
to improve this experiment, if given the opportunity to perform it again, one simple solution would involve three students in the group recording times for every trial and performing multiple trials for each part of the procedure. a more advanced way to reduce the random error in this experiment involves some sort of guide or arm to drop the pendulum in a specific way each time in order to alleviate the random error involved in a person dropping the pendulum. another more advanced way would involve obtaining and using a photogate to record the times for each oscillation automatically. incorporating a photogate to time each period of the pendulum would remove perhaps the biggest source of error in this experiment, which is the random error inherent in people recording time measurements by reacting to visual stimuli. the systematic errors in this experiment would generally be solved by using more precise methods of measuring angles, length, and time. the aspects of measuring angles and measuring times more accurately are essentially solved by using a photogate and a guide or an arm to drop the pendulum. a simpler “solution” to fix the issue of the pendulum oscillating sideways concerns only using trials where a sideways oscillation was not present in the pendulum’s motion.
as the graphs of the data that were collected and the data show, there is no visible pattern or relationship between period and mass in the experiments that were performed. this is logical to the group, as the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the earth, is close to 9.8 m/s2 towards the earth, irrespective of the mass of the object.
the conclusion, derived from the data that were collected in lab 1, is that the angle does not affect the period at small angles of less than 20° (from the vertical). at greater angles, the data support a positive correlation between the period of the pendulum and the angle of release. additionally, there was a large correlation coefficient (r2 is 0.982) for the graph of the average period (s) versus the angle of release (° from the vertical), proving that the data collected were accurate.


according to the data that were collected in the experiments performed for lab 1, there is a clear relationship between the period of oscillation of a pendulum and its length. the data support the hypothesis made in lab 1 is  as the length of the pendulum increases, the period of the pendulum increases, too, although these two variables are not directly proportional. this result is logical to the group, as decreasing the length of the pendulum causes the distance through which the pendulum travels within each period to decrease.

a smaller σ means that the spread of the data is minimal compared to the mean, whereas a larger σ indicates that the spread of the data is high compared to the mean.


the greater the amount of random error in the experiment, the larger the σ value for that experiment. the effects of systematic error are not noticeable in the value of σ. systematic error is a type of error that skews every result in the same way, meaning that the mean of the data is also skewed along with all of the data. this means that the standard deviation is unaffected, as the spread of the data remains unchanged and the mean is affected in the same way as the data.



representing ranges of uncertainty for data collected




the value for standard deviation is a measure of the spread (from the mean) of a dataset. the value for standard deviation informs one about the ranges in which the true value is likely to lie. for example, the true value has a 95% chance to be located within two standard deviations (±2σ) of the mean. using the table above, it follows that there is a 95% chance that the true value for the average period for a pendulum of length 0.534 m, an angle of release of 10° (from the vertical), and a mass of 0.05 kg, is 1.4202 ± 0.1656.

in lab 1, it was claimed that the length of the pendulum affects the period of oscillation of the pendulum, while the mass of the pendulum and the angle of release of the pendulum do not affect the period of oscillation of the pendulum. these claims hold for pendulum lengths of 0.019 meters to 0.059 meters, and under the constant conditions of a pendulum mass of 0.050 kilograms and an angle of release of 10° (from the vertical).
the length of the string greatly affected the period of the pendulum when the angle of release and the mass on the end of the pendulum were held constant at 10° from the vertical and 50 grams, respectively. it was derived from the data that as the length of the string decreases, the period of the pendulum decreases, although the data does not support a direct proportionality between these two variables. this is demonstrated by the positive correlation between these variables in the tests that were conducted. this result is logical to the group, as decreasing the length of the pendulum causes the distance through which the pendulum travels within each period to decrease. the group is confident in the results of this experiment as many data were recorded by multiple students, increasing the accuracy of this experiment. considering that the error bars for the data points are far from overlapping, the group is still confident in making this claim. additionally, there was a large correlation coefficient (r2 is 0.991) for the trendline of the average period (s) versus the length of the pendulum (cm), proving that the data collected were accurate. the trendline is most likely an accurate representation of the data in this instance as the correlation coefficient is extremely high.



the angle of release from the vertical (for angles less than or equal to 20°) did not affect the period of the pendulum when the length of the pendulum and the mass on the end of the pendulum were held constant at 59 centimeters and 50 grams, respectively. it was derived from the data that as the angle of release increases, the period of the pendulum remains unchanged for small angles. however, at angles larger than 20° from the vertical, the data does support a positive correlation between these two variables. the group is relatively confident in the results of this experiment as many data were recorded by multiple students, increasing the accuracy of this experiment. this conclusion is also supported by the fact that the error bars for the data points at 10° (from the vertical) and 20° (from the vertical) overlap with each other, whereas the other error bars do not overlap so much. additionally, there was a large correlation coefficient (r2 is 0.982) for the trendline of the average period (s) versus the angle of release (° from the vertical), proving that the data collected were accurate. the trendline is likely to be accurate in this case due to the high correlation coefficient.



the mass on the end of the pendulum did not affect the period of the pendulum when the length of the pendulum and the angle of release of the pendulum were held constant at 59 centimeters and 10° from the vertical, respectively. it was derived from the data that as the mass on the end of the pendulum increases, the period of the pendulum remains unchanged. the error bars on the graph of each data point overlap, showing that there is no correlation between the period and the mass. this is logical to the group, as the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the earth, is close to 9.8 m/s2 towards the earth, irrespective of the mass of the object. the group is completely confident in the results of this experiment as many data were recorded by multiple students, increasing the accuracy of this experiment. the lack of any correlation between the mass on the end of the pendulum and the length of the period of the pendulum is shown by the low correlation coefficient (r2 is 0.549) for the trendline of the average period (s) versus the mass of the pendulum (g). the trendline is unlikely to be accurate in this case due to the low amount of confidence derived from the correlation coefficient.

the group agrees with student 1 because his method, while introducing more systematic error (from kinetic friction and air resistance), will greatly reduce the random error involved in timing a moving object. as student 2 correctly states, it is true that the pendulum will slow down slightly as a result of energy lost to kinetic friction between the pendulum and the metal bar to which it is attached and air resistance. however, this energy loss (and the systematic error that results from it) is negligible compared to the random errors introduced into the experiment that would result from timing only one oscillation.

the best option for the two students is a, as random error can be reduced by performing more trials in an experiment. option b is incorrect, as systematic error cannot be reduced by performing more trials. systematic error can be fixed by changing or modifying the methods of recording and performing the experiment in a way that reduces errors. option c is clearly incorrect as there exist methods of reducing error in experiments (as discussed above!).

this lab was conducted september 10th during lab time with triston harlin, jaryd alderson, sam wilson.

as we determined in the previous labs, the independent variables of the angle of release and the mass on the end of the pendulum do not affect the period of the pendulum (for angles of less than 20॰). these conclusions are supported by the data taken in the first and second labs. for the graphs of average period v. mass, it was concluded that the mass on the end of the pendulum did not affect the average period of the pendulum, as the error bars for each data point overlapped with the error bars for every other data point. additionally, the low correlation coefficient (r2 is 0.549) for the trendline of the graph of average period v. mass showed that there was little to no correlation between the mass and the average period. as for the average period v. the angle of release, the graph created in lab 2 (with error bars) generally shows that the data points are overlapping or nearly overlapping. in particular, the error bars for angles of 10॰ and 20॰ overlap, so it is concluded that, for angles of less than 20॰, the angle has no effect on the period of the pendulum. as the data from last lab shows, the length of the pendulum affects the period of the pendulum, as the error bars on the graph are far from overlapping and the correlation coefficient (r2 is 0.991) is quite high. therefore, the only trials that the group has decided to perform are the ones testing this relationship.

the photogate reduced the amount of random error in timing the period of oscillation of the pendulum to 0, but the photogate still has a scale error of 0.001 seconds. so, an uncertainty of ±0.002 seconds was used in the error bars for the graph above, as ± 2σ is the written standard for this course (as stated in some of the pre-labs). additionally, the same scale error exists in the measurements for the length of the pendulum, as the tape measure used to measure the length of the pendulum is only accurate to the nearest millimeter (0.001 meters). therefore, an uncertainty of ±0.002 meters was put in the error bars for the length of the pendulum.

the period of oscillation of a pendulum is affected only by the length of the pendulum. this claim holds for pendulums of any mass, as long as the pendulum is released from a small angle (less than 20° from the vertical). it is logical that the length of the pendulum affects the period of the pendulum, as the length of the pendulum directly affects the distance through which the pendulum travels. and, the farther that the pendulum must travel, the more time it will take to do so, which directly affects the period. in the group’s trials for the period v. the length of the pendulum when using the photogate, the controls were the angle of release (10° from the vertical) and the mass on the end of the pendulum (0.005 kilograms). through the trials performed in this lab, the relationship between the period of oscillation of the pendulum and the length of the pendulum is described by a positive power series function.
to find a mathematical model to describe the relationship between the period of oscillation of the pendulum and the length of the pendulum, the group performed the experiments for the period v. the length of the pendulum using the photogate to record the periods, which allowed for much more accurate results. using the photogate completely eliminated the random and systematic error involved in manual timing of the pendulum’s oscillations. the only sources of error that remained in our experiments were the scale error of the pendulum (0.001 seconds), the scale error of the tape measure which was used to measure the length of the pendulum (0.001 meters), the random error associated with manually dropping the pendulum, and the systematic error caused by air resistance and kinetic friction between the pendulum and the metal arm to which it is attached. all of these errors are negligible, so our group is confident in the data that was collected in this experiment. after performing the trials in this experiment, the data was used to create a graph of the period v. the length of the pendulum. after creating this graph and analyzing the trendlines that could connect the data points, it was determined that the relationship between the period of oscillation of the pendulum and the length of the pendulum is that of a positive power series function. for the power series trendline, the mathematical model produced by google sheets had a correlation coefficient of r2 is 1, which is perfect. additionally, the trendline appears to pass through each point perfectly, as the r2 value suggests. the model derived from our data,         $t=2 l^{0.493}$         led to the claim that a power series relationship exists between the period of oscillation of the pendulum and the length of the pendulum.
the mathematical model from the group pictured above corroborates the findings from our group. the coefficients in their mathematical model are nearly the same as ours, and they also achieved a high level of accuracy with an r2 value of 0.9999, which is extremely close to perfect. other groups also had very similar data and equations, with r2 values of nearly 1, and coefficients that were, negligibly the same as the coefficients obtained in our mathematical model. therefore, the data from other groups clearly supports the findings from this lab, and further increases the confidence that the group has in our claims.
the theoretical model for the period of the pendulum, as found on http is //hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pend.html, is  $t=2 l$    taking the coefficient of gravity near the surface of the earth (where these experiments were performed) to be 9.80665 m/s2, we have tha$t=19.6133 l$.  simplifying, we have that     $t=19.6133 l$     taking the square root of 9.80665 and multiplying this result by 2π gives us that $t=2.006 l$. this equation, derived from manipulating the mathematical model in a way that allows for comparison to the model that was derived from our data, shows that our results correspond almost exactly to the theoretical model. the leading coefficient is off by a mere 0.006, and the power of l is off by 0.007. these differences can be accounted for by the small amount of random and systematic errors that are still present in our experiment. these errors were described above in further detail.
if the same experiment was performed on the moon, the period of oscillation of the pendulum would increase. on the moon, the acceleration due to gravity is multiple times less than it is on earth. looking at the theoretical model for the period of a pendulum ($t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$), it is easy to see that reducing the value for g, the acceleration due to gravity, would cause an increase in the coefficient that is multiplied by the square root of the length of the pendulum, thus increasing the period.
our group believes that every factor (except one) has been tested in determining the variables which may affect the period of the pendulum the only factor that was not tested for is the acceleration due to gravity, as we do not have the means by which we can significantly alter this value for our experiment. we found that, out of all the possible factors that could impact the period of the pendulum, only the length of the pendulum impacted the period. as a result of knowing the theoretical model for the period of the pendulum    $t=2 l$    it is straightforward to notice that only the length of the pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity affect the period of the pendulum.
one suggested improvement that would increase the accuracy and consistency of our measurements would be the release of the pendulum system. with the manner that our trials work now, it is impossible for us to be 100% consistent in how we release the bob each time without enacting extra force or causing the bob to follow a non-linear path during the period. these discrepancies are very minimal but using a mechanical system to release the exact same way every time would further increase our experiments reliability and accuracy.
in the experimental data, the period of oscillation of the pendulum was 1.385 seconds when the length of the pendulum was measured at 0.47 meters. using the mathematical model derived from our data in this experiment, a pendulum length of 0.50 meters would have an expected period of oscillation of 1.470 seconds. the difference in the period for these two data points is minimal, and the expected period of oscillation for a pendulum length of  0.50 meters should be slightly longer than the period of oscillation of the pendulum for a pendulum length of 0.47 meters, which it is.
practice with a hypothetical scenario
using the mathematical model derived from the experiment, and solving, the group found that the length of the pendulum should be 6.21 meters. the mass is not important, as it does not affect the period of oscillation of the pendulum, and the angle of release should be less than 20° from the vertical.
