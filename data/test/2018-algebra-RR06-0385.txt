discussion and conclusions

	the question that is being addressed in this experiment is how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. using a system consisting of a pulley and a cart that is suspended with air pressure to reduce friction, this experiment was conducted using the movement of bobbers. knowing the weight of the bobbers on the down side of the pulley, the amount of applied force could be calculated. moving the bobbers from the downward side to the cart itself, allowed for the change in applied force to perform this experiment and kept the overall mass of the system the same, being a controlled variable.

	in table 1 above, the data for each different applied force can be seen with the given acceleration of the cart per trial. when translated into the graph above, fig. 1, the data forms a linear relationship between acceleration and applied force. the trend was positive with the equation $y=3.92 x + 0.14$. this relationship agrees with the predicted trend in the beginning of the experiment, that as applied force is increased, the acceleration of the system will increase. when looking at the model $f=m a$, acceleration is equal to force divided by mass of the system ($a=\frac{f}{m}f$). in that model, the force (f) is the amount of hanging weight (mg). the mass (m) is the mass of the system. according to the theoretical model of acceleration, 1/m of the system should be equal to the 3.92 number that was found in the experiment. when calculating the mathematical model that was obtained, it was found that the 1/m of the system was 5.2 and not 3.92. when looking at other data that was obtained, the other groups also obtained the same general trend in the positive direction. like the data that was obtained, there were many other groups that got numbers close to the 1/m number, 3.92, but like the data that was obtained, it was often not close.

	another common theme between groups was the presence of a y-intercept. our equation was $y=3.92 x + 0.14$. when looking at the relationship $f=m a$, there is no value that would relate to this y-intercept. it was concluded that this y-intercept is because the cart started with an acceleration. that acceleration comes from the movement of the cart in the beginning due to the air pressure. another reason could have come from the friction that is still in the environment. the y-intercept will always be there unless the experiment was performed in a frictionless environment. the mass of the string does not attribute to the acceleration. this is because the string would still be involved in the mass of the system so including or excluding the strings mass does not matter because the object will still have uniform acceleration.

	when looking at an experiment like this, there are many forms of error that are possible, both random and systematic. human error falls under the category of random error which could have come in the form of where the starting position was placed, to the placement of the bobbers. systematic error could come in the form of the weights of the bobbers. you have to measure the mass of all the bobbers because some might have slight variations in how much they weight.
