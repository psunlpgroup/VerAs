conclusion:



the question that this experiment is trying to answer is “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? “ 

the mass does not have any effect on the length of the period. the mass was tested by making a pendulum of 50g and increasing the mass per trial in 40g increments. the starting mass along with each increment was measured with a triple beam balance. as the mass of the pendulum was increased, the length of the period increased or decreased inconsistently. even with using the error bars, a straight line cannot be drawn on the graph. therefore, a relationship between the mass of the pendulum and the period of the swing cannot be found.

the swing angle does not have any effect on the length of the period. the swing angle was tested by holding a protractor the point that the pendulum swung from, pulling the pendulum back to a degree value away from the middle, and releasing. the pendulum was first released 30 degrees away from the vertical, then was tested in increments of 2 degrees smaller. as the angle was changed, the length of the period increased and decreased inconsistently. a straight line cannot be drawn that connects the error bars of every point. therefore, a relationship between swing angle and the length of the period cannot be found. 

the length of the string does have an effect of the length of a pendulum. the length of the string was started at .3 meters, and each trial tested a string that was .1m longer. the string length was measured with a tape measure. the swing time of the first trial was measured by hand. for the first trial, a straight line can be drawn through the error bars of the graph, confirming the hypothesis of a relationship existing between the length of the string and the period of the pendulum. for further confirmation, another trial was done using an electronic photogate. the string length was still measured with a tape measure. the initial measurement was .3m and each trial was incremented by .1m. again, a line could be drawn through the error bars of the data, further confirming a relationship between string length and length of the period. 

the relationship between string length and the length of the period can be represented as a power function. the equation that was derived from the graph is 2.0451x.4334. other types of relationships were tested, but the power equation had the highest r value of .9634. a linear function was the second closest and had an r value of .9245. the theoretical equation can be simplified as 2.006x2. the coefficient of our equation has an error of approximately 2% and the exponent of our equation has an error of approximately 14%, meaning that the calculated equation is similar to the theoretical equation but not completely accurate.

the experiment was conducted in a manner that leaves room for many potential errors. in measuring the swing angle in all trials, if the protractor was not aligned correctly with the top of the pendulum, this would cause the swing angle to either increase or decrease. the angle that the pendulum was pulled to before release was approximated by eye, so error could exist there. the length of the string in all trials was measured with a tape measure. if a longer string were use than what was recorded, the period of the pendulum would increase, or would decrease if a shorter string were used. the mass was measured using a triple beam balance. if the balance were mis-calibrated prior to being used, this could cause the mass to be less or more than what is recorded.

there are some constraints that cannot be controlled in this experiment, which degrade accuracy. the air pressure and would affect the air resistance of the pendulum. a higher air pressure would increase the length of the period. the motion of the air around the pendulum would also affect the period by either making it longer or shorter. the trajectory of the pendulum could also be affected by bumping the table, either making the period longer or shorter. for each trial that the string was used, the string was weakened and frayed. this could potentially change the period of the pendulum. whether this would make the period longer or shorter is unknown.
