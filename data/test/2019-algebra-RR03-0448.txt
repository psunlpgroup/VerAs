conclusion:
The experiment was to see if length of the string, mass of the weight on it, and the angle at which the string was dropped. The independent variable was the length of the string. The dependent variable was the period of the pendulum. Before we were started out experiment we set up control variables that would stay the same throughout the whole experiment. The angle we dropped the string would not change at an angle of 30 degrees. Also, the mass of the pendulum was always 50g. Once this was all figured out we set up our hypothesis to be the length of the string influences the period of the pendulum. 
In the graph on the left you can see that we concluded 6 different tests with all different lengths of string. The times were taken on a recording device that is very accurate. The graph to the right is the graph of the averages and there string lengths. This shows the correlation of the length and the difference in time they take to complete one period
After we concluded our experiment it was found out that the string length is the only thing that affected the period of the pendulum. The mass of the pendulum and the angle it was dropped from was not factors in the period of the pendulum.
