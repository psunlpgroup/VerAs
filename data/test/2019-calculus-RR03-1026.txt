discussion and conclusion

in this experiment, we investigated what factors affected the amount of time it takes for a pendulum to make one full swing. the first experiment, the one testing the angle of release, addressed the research question by varying what the angle of release actually was, while holding the string length and mass of the pendulum constant to be able to discover if this factor affected the time of oscillation for the pendulum. this variation can be seen in table 6 and a graph representation can be seen in figure 3. from these, we could gather that angle of release had an effect on the pendulum only when it was greater than 20º. 

in the second experiment, where we tested the effect of mass on the pendulum, the research question was addressed by a similar method to the angle of release. we increased the mass with each trial while holding the angle of release and the string length the same. these constant variables would help isolate mass as a possible factor for the time it takes a pendulum to make one oscillation. the results of this experiment can be found in table 5 and figure 2 and it follows that mass does not have an effect on the time period of an oscillation under any conditions.

	in the final experiment, we measured a varying string length to see if it had an effect on the pendulum. as with the other two experiments, the other two possible factors were held constant to solidify the result of the string length being a factor. the results of this experiment could be found in table 4 and figure 1. with these results, we see that string length does have an effect on the oscillation in all conditions.

	the theoretical mathematical model is $t=2$ our data fits with our model because the only variables in this are string length and the gravity constant. specifically, this fits figure 1 because it is the only graph with a positive correlation and not a zero correlation as with the other two variables which can be seen in figure 2 and figure 3. in our lab, we could not test gravity so that is why it appears in the theoretical model and not our experimental model. 

	error in our measurements could have resulted from bending of the tape measure which would have systematically increased our error with each trial. random error could have resulted from a measurement falling between two ruler markings. also, the timer could have randomly stopped and started earlier and later. systematic error would also have been introduced through delayed reaction time. to reduce systematic error, we could use different methods of measurement, by using a different scale, tape measure, or using different people to take the measurements. the photogate was used to measure the period more accurately. to reduce random error, we could perform multiple trails and average our results although this wouldn’t reduce systematic error.

	one constraint in this experiment is that we could not vary gravity so there was no way for us to include that in our experimental model. this could be tested if there was an area where gravity was more or less than earth’s standard gravity constant of 9.8 m/. another constraint was that we had to keep the angle of release below 20º. this was so that it followed the model of a simple pendulum and the angle of release was not a factor in the time of oscillation. as we could observe from figure 3, if the angle of release was higher than 20º then there would be an effect on how long the period of the pendulum was.
