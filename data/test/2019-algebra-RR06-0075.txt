discussion 



	the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models that describe the behavior of a real system and to develop an understanding on the different variables and the numerical values included within the model.

in lab 5, the experiment comparing the applied force of the system and the impacts it causes to the acceleration of the system are demonstrated in the positive linear mathematical model (figure 1). the mathematical model equation for this w$a=3.0715$ where a equals the acceleration and fa is the force applied. 3.0915 is the slope of the equation which means that it is steadily increasing by this amount per fa. the second experiment in lab 5 was comparing the mass of the cart and the acceleration of the system. this mathematical model is a negative power function (figure 2) the mathematical model equation is $a=0.593$ where a and fa equal the same as the first experiment. 1.543 is the downward slope of this equation because fa has the exponent of -.958 which is the rate of decay since its negative. in lab 6, the experiment was the tilt of the system impacting the acceleration of the system.  the mathematical models for this experiment all represent a positive linear graph (figure 3,4,5). the mathematical models all have relatively the same equations for their models which are linear. for the small block the equation was 2.9942x-.0475, the medium block was, 2.703x-.0457, and the large block was, 2.8703x-.0457. the slopes of these equations are 2.9942, 2.703 and 2.8703 which goes up at this rate per the number at which x is. by looking at these equations it can be seen that there is no correlation between the varying tilts and the acceleration of the system.

group 1 has data that is fairly similar to our findings. their data has similar slopes to ours because they are in the 2.9xxx range. they also have r2 values of 1 or .9999 which means that their data is fairly strong, and it lies perfectly on the trendline. group 2 has data that is somewhat similar to ours but seems to be slightly lower. this data closely matches our data from the 2nd experiment of the medium block tilt. the r2 values are close to 1 which means they fit the trendline for their data almost perfectly. both of these groups allow us to understand what our numerical values in the mathematical models represent. 



	one random error that could be possible in this experiment is if the program that collected the data is not started at about the same time as the vacuum was turned on. this error would lead to less data being collected therefore would impact the mathematical equation that is obtained from the data. this can be resolved by having one person start the program and another person start the vacuum by counting to 3 then both people start either the vacuum or the program. this communication in the future would reduce the possibility of this error occurring. another random error that could have occurred is not knowing the exact mass of every bobber. although the bobbers are similar, they can vary slightly within their mass. since this experiment constantly used mass this could have impacted the results for acceleration for every experiment conducted. this error can be fixed by measuring the mass of every bobber.  lastly, a random error that could occur is if the string came off the pulley. this would cause for a sudden stop in the data being collected or the data being collected is inaccurate. nothing can fix this error because its occurring while you're collecting data but one way to try to prevent this is by making sure the string lies on the pulley and the placement holder correctly and the hanging mass isn't swinging which can cause the string to easily slip off. 

	the biggest constraint in this experiment was in experiment 6. when varying the tilt/ height of the system, the difference between each experiment was very minimal. in order to find out if the tilt does impact the acceleration of the system then the tilt of the system needs to have a larger difference between the heights. 

	our experimental mathematical models are consistent with newton's second law because they produce linear equations. when comparing the equations it can be seen that the mass of the system is our x value in the equations while the acceleration of the system would be the y- intercept value.
