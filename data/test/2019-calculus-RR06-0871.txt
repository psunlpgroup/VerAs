discussion and conclusion

	the purpose of this lab is to determine what independent variables affected the acceleration of a cart moving on a frictionless path. the applied force onto the system was tested, as well as changing the amount of mass on the system. these variables were derived from newton’s second law $f=ma$. with that, the graph of the acceleration vs mass and acceleration vs force graphs are both linear. to further test these relationships, a change in elevation at the front of the plane was also tested to yield another linear graph of acceleratio$n=c f + 2 c$.

	  as previously mentioned, each experiment produced a linear graph for graphs 1 and 2 which shows a constant trend in acceleration with mass and force since the r^2 value is very close to 1. since acceleration decreases when mass increases, it shows an inverse relationship between the acceleration and the mass. in the acceleration versus applied force experiment, the acceleration increased with the amount of applied force which shows a direct relationship between the two variables. in the final experiment, c1 depicts the rate of which the object accelerates which stays consistent given that the amount of gravity acting on the object is consistent and there is hypothetically no friction acting on it. the value c2 decreases in the linear equation with each increase in height at the front of the plane and which means that the acceleration will decrease consistently depending on the tilt of the plane.

	group 5’s experiment was similar to the one conducted by our group however they added height to the back end of their system rather than the front like ours. it is observed in their results that as the height of the back end increases, the velocity increases at a quicker rate, which is to say their acceleration decreased. that is the opposite of what happened in our lab which is to be expected since they worked with an opposite direction. group 6 as reference as us by testing the change in height at the front of the system. it is observed in their data that the slope remains the same with each change in height but the higher the difference is at the front, the lower the y intercept will be. 

	systematic errors could have occurred in the scale that measured that mass of the system. if this were an issue, if the error from the scale were provided then that value can be factored into all the values of mass a new graph can be produced. there also could have been systematic errors with the machine that measured the velocity of the system. this could be remedied the same way factoring the error value back into each velocity value and the constant should change.

	these conclusions can only be given if friction doesn’t act on the system since the track was designed to blow air and provide a hypothetically frictionless surface. if friction were to act on the system, then there would need to be another force measured and subtracted in the opposite direction of any applied force.

	in the two mathematical models, mass is kept the same on the system and as force increases on the system, acceleration does as well. this is true because each of the curves have a direct ratio relationship between the acceleration and the force.
