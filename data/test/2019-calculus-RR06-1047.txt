discussion and conclusion

how does the acceleration of the system change when the masses in the system change or when the frictional forces change?  according to lab 5 is  graph 1, the slope of the line indicates that changing the hanging mass does affect the acceleration of the system.  changing the hanging mass changed the force of the system, therefore increasing the acceleration.  a claim can be made that changing the hanging mass, changes the force, which changes the acceleration.  two groups also had the same results as ours.  they used slightly different mass measurements, but in the end, it ended up with the same results.  the theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by single force is $a = 0.0028 f - 0.0052$.  this theoretical model supports our findings.  it states that as force increases so will the acceleration because of their direct relationship.  the enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system is $a = \frac{m}{f} - c1$.  this model supports our findings because it states as c1 gets bigger the acceleration decreases.  c1 is the frictional force.  lab 6 is  graphs 1, 2, and 3 all prove this by showing that the more frictional force, the lesser amount of acceleration.  a heavier string would affect the acceleration of a system.  a claim can be made that the frictional force negatively affects the acceleration of system.  two groups also had data to support this claim. the acceleration would decrease because of the heavier string.  random errors may be wrongly weighing the mass of the system when measuring the mass of the system.  this could be reduced by double checking the measurements.  constraints with this lab include not being able to finish part 2 in lab period.
