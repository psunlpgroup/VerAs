conclusion:
The purpose of this lab was to find the relationship between acceleration and applied force, after finding the relationship we were to put it into a math model equation that fit our data the best. As in the graph a linear fit was the best, giving a very small y-intercept which is due to the uncertainty. They are directly related so as the applied force increased so did the acceleration. 
Below are groups two and three’s hypothesis, variables, data obtained from their own experiments. Both groups graphs support my groups, as the applied force increased so did the acceleration. Group two said friction was a controlled variable which I disagree with, it’s a systematic error that could have slowed down the acceleration which we did not account for, but it was not controlled. Other than that the data and findings are all very similar most of the differences due to uncertainties. 



Other forces that were present besides hanging force was gravity f, normal force and friction. Because the cart was not moving up or down the normal and gravity forces did not have any impact. But friction could slow down the acceleration and because it wasn’t accounted for or due to the students it’s a systematic error. These were not accounted for in the equation. The mass of the system showed up no where specifically in the equation, because the weight was consistent during the whole experiment it did not need to be included in the equation. The string also affected the acceleration by adding friction and since the weight wasn’t directly on the cart it created some kind of lag which is why the hanging mass is even able to affect the acceleration. Random errors in this experiment included using the scale to weigh the carts which could change the calculations. Systematic errors could be friction, the actual velocity calculator and the uncertainty which all cannot be changed.
