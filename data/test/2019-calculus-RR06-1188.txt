discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab is to understand the mathematical model of an object on a frictionless surface and how the angle of a frictionless track can affect the numerical values. this understanding of the mathematical model was most self-evident during the first lab period but was carried over to our second lab period.  once we understood the mathematical model of the lab it was the second lab period that we were understanding the variable and numerical value included in our mathematical model we originally found in the first lab period. 
during these two labs we conducted three experiments; the change of acceleration when m1 and m2 change, when just m2 changes, and when the angle of the track changes. these three lead us to finding the mathematical model and eventually the physical meaning behind the variables used in the mathematical models. each experiment is able to be backed up with evidence from the graph. 

in the first experiment, the change in acceleration when m1 and m2 are changing, but the mass of the system will stay constant. the initial mass of m1 was 0 g and m2 was 40 g, so as the mass of m1 increased the mass of m2 decreased making the acceleration of the system decrease as well. since the acceleration is decreasing, we can find that the equation of our acceleration line will be $y=24.247 x - 1.37$ and r² is 0.8105. during the second experiment we were still working on understanding the mathematical model, but this experiment also brought attention to newton’s second law. the mass of m1 was not going to have any change but the mass of m2 increased by 5 g each time. since we were adding 5g of mass to m2, the gravity acting of m2 caused the acceleration due to gravity to increase for m1 due to the tension for m1 and m2 being equal to m2*g. comparing our findings to newton’s second law we know that when m2 has a greater mass causing the force acting on m1 to increase. the acceleration is increasing, so we can find the equation of our acceleration line by the data plotted on a graph to be $y=-8e^{-0}5x^2+0.0306 x-0.0102$ and r^2 is 1.
the last experiment was changing the track of the system that will increase or decrease the acceleration depending on which side is being elevated. in this experiment we were supposed to be able to find the physical meaning of each variable as well as furthering our understanding of the mathematical model. our physical change was increasing the height of the side the cart was released. from this we found the acceleration increases when the angle increases based on the data, we collected from the experiment plotted on the graph 6.1. our equation found was $y=0.0282 x+0.1158$; r^2 is 0.9998.
they were testing the slope of their ramp just like ours. our data was in the positive and negative slope although they have one extra test than ours.
random error may have been present from variations in measurements and not accounting for standard deviation of the mass of the bobbers. we reduced this error by measuring every bobber used in the experiment. systematic error might have been present when using the computer to measure the acceleration of the cart on the frictionless track. we tried to reduce this error by considering possible error in slope and noting it.

one constraint that would greatly limit our generalizability is that our experiment was done on a frictionless track using a frictionless pulley. therefore, our results could only apply to scenarios in which friction is not present. 

with our two experimental mathematical models we are able to use newton’s second law because of the acceleration is due to the gravity the tension of the string allows us to connect the sum of the forces for m1 and m2.   . and .
