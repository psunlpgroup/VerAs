conclusion: 
a model for a force vs acceleration relationship found was $a=38.164 x - 7.215$ with an r squared value of .9563 which means its not the most accurate data. we determined that some sort of random error existed but it was searched for to no avail. the figure above shows the group results from lab 5
in lab 6, 4 different models were made but were all essentially the same with a different b value, $y = 0.0303 x – b$ and have r squared vales of .9999 to 1 proving to be accurate. these different b values were from the different slopes of the track. using the two figures above of different groups findings, our results appear to be very similar despite one group changed the direction of the track slope oppositely compared to ours. in this lab there didn’t appear to be much measurable error besides that given by the measuring devices. constraints in this lab mainly came from the 3 different heights we could adjust the track to and the amount of weights we had. with more of either of these a smaller margin of error overall would be found.
