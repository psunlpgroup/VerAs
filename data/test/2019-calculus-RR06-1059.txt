discussion and conclusion:



the purpose of the lab was to develop a mathematical model for the different accelerations of a system involving a sled with different masses and incline in the system. this was to prove our hypothesis of acceleration being affected by different variable changes. the change in applied force increased the rate of acceleration (figure 3.) the change in mass decreased the rate of acceleration (figure 5.) the change in the incline of the system increased acceleration when in the front (figure 7a.) and decreased acceleration when in the back (figure 7b.)

the mathematical model from figure 3 is equal to $y=2.1569 x + 0.001$ this shows that as the applied force in newtons increases the acceleration increases by 2.1569, in addition the y-intercept is 0.0012. if the applied force is decreased, the acceleration of the system also decreased. the mathematical model from figure 5 is equal to $y=\frac{27.26}{x^{0.09}}$ this shows that as the applied force in newtons increases the acceleration increases by 27.26 and a power of -0.093. if the applied force is decreased, the acceleration of the system also decreased. in regards to newton's second law the equation is an inverse, a power relationship where force is constant and mass is changing. in lab 6, figure 8, our mathematical models differ for all the system changes but the slope in the model represents the total forces combined plus the angle recorded.

the angles group 2 used are much larger than those from our group, however they used larger differences in height. they predicted the acceleration of the sled would increase with the downward slope which is consistent with what our team predicted as well. they concluded, “as the angle of the system positively increases, the acceleration negatively decreases.” which matches our data collection. however, their independent variable yielded larger results, which is only because they used larger numbers.

factors that could of affected the results could be an uneven table for the track to sit, environmental wind because it wasn't an isolated system, and air resistance from the system not being in a vacuum. the uneven table could have affected the trials by having a not uniform angle for us to measure and therefore could be greater or less than the calculated angle. the wind could have been in the positive or negative direction of the sled’s acceleration and could have increased or decreased the rate. the sled hovered on air  which as a result it had air resistance and that could have acted as a form of friction, reducing the rate of acceleration.

a way to improve our design is to use a frictionless surface, not one that was close to frictionless. in addition, using a string material that had less friction like fishing wire or chicken wire and a pulley that didn't also have friction. by doing this the force of friction would be decreased, therefore increasing applied force and increasing acceleration.

our mathematical model fits newton’s second law as a linear model. with the equation $a=\frac{f_{applied} + f_{unknown}}{m}$ which was derived from $f=m a$. for model  two the manipulated equation is $a=\frac{f_{applied}}{m}$
