discussion and conclusion:

in this experiment we set out to answer the question “what impacts the period of a pendulum?”. one of the variables we tested was the length of the string which the pendulum was attached to.  the length of the string(iv) is directly proportional to the period(dv). this claim is true for any of our collected data points, ranged (10-190cm), and if the mass of the pendulum and angle of release is constant at 250g and 15*. none of the error bars intersect meaning that they are all independent values.  another variable that we tested was mass attached to the pendulum.  the mass of the pendulum (iv) is not related to the period(dv). this claim holds true for our tested masses between 47.6 - 247.6 and if the length of the string and angle are held constant at 13.5 in and 45*. all of the error bars intersect each other which means that all period values could arguably be the same.  the last variable we tested was the angle of release.  the period of a pendulum (dv) is directly related to the angle of release(iv)  for angles over 40 degrees. this claim holds true when the differences in the angles is drastic for our measurement range of 10-60* and when the length of the string is 50.2cm and the mass is 110.1. for example, if 10* is compared to 60* the period time is shorter for 10*.  

	the biggest random error we encountered was the string randomly swinging different ways.  this is because of instability in our pendulum apparatus.  another reason for this is because we the drop was not exactly perpendicular to the pendulum apparatus. we could fix this by fixing the pendulum to a wall and dropping it very near the wall.  a systematic error that may have occurred was an improperly calibrated scale.  this would affect all of our values of mass, either making them all too high or too low.  finally the constraints of our experiment were, the pendulum apparatus, the string material, and the masses we had.  the pendulum apparatus will be hard to recreate and negatively impact the generalizability of the results, as it was unique to the lab which we conducted the experiment in.  the string will not be hard to generalize, as it is easily available.  the masses we had were improperly calibrated and may have affected our measurements.  some other-shaped masses would have different air resistances and in effect, different periods.
