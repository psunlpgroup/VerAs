Within this experiment we were asked to conduct research to find out what affects the period of a pendulum. We tested three factors; mass of the object, length of the string, and angle of release. We tested to see if the mass would affect the period of the pendulum because we know in physics that mass can affect acceleration and therefore could have possibly had an of affect on the time of oscillation. However, we determined in our research that even with a change in mass the period of the pendulum was unchanged, the graph clearly shows the time was constant with very little room for error shown by the error bars. We then tested the length of the string to see how that would possibly affect the period of the pendulum because the longer the distance you could assume the more time each oscillation would take. We concluded that the length of the string did in fact have a positive correlation with how long each period was as you can see from the graph it gradually increases with each jump in length and with very little error as shown by the error bars. Finally, we tested to see whether the angle of release would affect the time of oscillation. As we gradually increased the angle of release you can see that it had no affect on the period of the pendulum as shown in the graph. In addition to that the error bars also indicate that there isnâ€™t much give or take within the data either.
Amongst all of that we were also able to determine that the theoretical equation of a pendulum could be represented as such  is 
$y=1.3$
Considering that the only correlation found was between the length of the string and the time of oscillation we just had to find the equation that is true for that graph. Seeing as the graph has a constant increasing slope, we were able to determine that the equation would have to be linear which is what our data supports.
Throughout this experiment we had very few random errors, one of which was due to misuse of a stop watch which we were eventually able to overcome with a sensor to track the period of the oscillation. Another random error was due to measuring technique. To eliminate this error, we could measure out the certain lengths of strings before hand to ensure that they are the appropriate size. Along with random errors there were also constraints within this experiment. We were only able to use the resources provided which could affect the results just due to lack of quality resources. We were also on a limited time basis which could lead to inaccurate results as well. 
This experiment asked for us to test multiple factors to determine what affects the period of a pendulum. We were without a doubt able to conclude that the only factor tested that did affect the oscillation time of the pendulum was the length of the string, all other factors were determined to have very little to no affect on the pendulum whatsoever.
