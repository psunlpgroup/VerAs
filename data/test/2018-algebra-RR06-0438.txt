discussion

	the question being asked in this lab is how would the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? this question is answered by looking at figure1. as the independent variable, hanging weight, increases, the acceleration of the system changes positively along a linear slope. looking at figure 1, the  value is 0.9995 which is almost exactly one which shows that this trend holds true that the relationship between acceleration and force/hanging weight is linear. the linear equation is $y=5.36 x - 0.0436$. the errors in the mass is due to how accurate the balance can be read based off the measuring criteria it gives. the tick marks it gives go down to .1g so the uncertainty is a very small value of 0.005for mass meaning it’s a small reading for applied force. this means that different masses that we measured are very separable. then for the uncertainty for acceleration, the value was 0.00302 which is also very small and can’t be read from figure 1. since there are no overlap of any uncertainties in the x-direction and the y-direction, then there is a statistical significance that there is a linear relationship between hanging mass (force) and acceleration of the system. 

one of the groups in the lab had a similar setup with a bigger mass of system. they ran three more data points but achieved a larger error among their trials. their mathematical model is $y=4.0483 x + 0.053$ with an error of 0.005 which varies a small bit from ours. theirs might differ a bit due to the increased three trials which allowed them to gain more data points for their graph. however, the difference in slopes isn’t huge. in our mathematical model of $y=5.36 x - 0.0436$ we have a negative y-intercept which might show that we are subtracting friction while the other groups y-intercept is positive. this differs only a small amount and could just be due to how the data points were read and measured. however, the two groups agree very similarly with each other that there is a linear relationship between the weight of the hanging mass and the acceleration of the system. overall, the consensus of a linear relationship holds true. the data from this group is highlighted below is 

another group in lab had a similar setup to the other group of there being eight data points being measured. their mathematical model was 4.4864x + 0.0234 with an error of 0.009 which also varies just a tiny bit from ours. this might also be due to us only having five bobbers to test and run trials with while other groups had eight, so they might have more accurate data. however, the trend still holds true that the relationship between acceleration of the system and the applied force from mass is still linear. they had the positive y-intercept which might also be from either getting more data points or other applications of control variables such as mass of system and cart release location. 

the theoretical equation of mass of system and acceleration is given by altering the $f =m a$ to get the theoretical of . this theoretical has no y-intercept which indicates that in this perfect scenario, there is no friction at all and the only thing affecting the acceleration of the system is mass of the hanging object. since friction can’t be eliminated entirely in our scenario, then our mathematical model is going to vary a little bit. however,  shows that the system still functions linearly. system mass relates to the fitting parameters because it is needed to determine the acceleration of the whole system. without the mass of the whole system, the acceleration of the whole system can’t be calculated, only parts of it. the mass of the system varies between the cart and the hanging weight, but overall is kept constant so applied force can be easily changed. also, it fits into how the relationship is linear due to there being no squared values and the slope of the line is essentially , then the relationship is dependent on the mass of the hanging object and therefore the applied force of gravity on this object. since friction is present, this can lead to a new theoretical equation being used. this equation, , takes into the account friction acting on the system. our mathematical model fits more into this equation because the “” part of the enhanced equation considers the friction (extra forces) that might account for the difference of the theoretical equation and the experimental model. this extra force still needs to be divided by mass of the system due to how the experiment is set up with the whole systems mass remaining constant and moving mass between the cart and the hanging object. extra forces (friction and maybe the very small amount of air resistance) fit into the parameter and cause a y-intercept because these forces act against the applied force caused by the hanging weight. when the enhanced equation includes the extra forces, it is considering there might be some outside forces that might change the acceleration by a small bit.

	if a heavy string was used to connect the hanging weight to the cart, then the acceleration would decrease. considering a perfect world where friction could be reduced to nothing, then the equation used would be . with a heavier string, the mass of the system would increase. therefore, with a higher mass of system, the applied force would be divided by a bigger number leading to a smaller acceleration. 

	random errors that could be encountered in this lab would be using human error in measuring the mass and judging a certain mass, as well as determining things such as cart start position when releasing the cart. human error is minimized by a bit when acceleration is calculated from datastudio rather than timing the cart and finding he distance. these random errors could change things randomly above or below the theoretical true value of acceleration. the only systematic error that could be encountered is if the balance used to measure mass was uncalibrated correctly, so something caused the mass to read mass to be higher or lower than they were. with these balances, this could be done by something breaking in the instrument. the way errors could be reduced would be running increased trials to lower random error. then to eliminate systematic error, using multiple balances to find the mass could eliminate any mistakes in the instrument and have the true mass value. constraints of the experiment are certainly the instrument being used to measure mass not being an electric balance, and rather a manual balance moving weights to see the mass of the object. this leaves a lot more room for interpretation and adds to random error. with an electric balance, if functioned correctly, could provide better data points, especially to more decimal points. datastudio is helpful when finding the acceleration but it only takes so many data points that it generalizes it and adds uncertainty values. if a certain program or instrument could be used to make the uncertainty even smaller, it would help with making the experiment more accurate. finally, the last constraint that has been hit upon multiple times earlier is that friction is present in the cart track. it is impossible to eliminate friction entirely, but it could be limited a lot lower with better equipment.

	as discovered in this lab, applied force has a linear relationship with acceleration of the system. through many different trials and comparing to other groups data and theoretical values, this has been supported multiple times by the data given.
