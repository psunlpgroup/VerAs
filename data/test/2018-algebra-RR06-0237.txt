concluded as well. 

from our data we formulated the mathematical model: $y=0.005 x + 0.0931$.  following experiment 1 we conducted experiment 2. in this experiment we needed to determine the hanging mass (force) needed to cause a larger cart (with mass of 295.6g) to experience a randomly assigned acceleration, using the equation from the previous experiment. for this experiment our assigned acceleration was 0.43 m/.  

for the basic equation for acceleration we know that $a = \frac{vf-vi}{t_f-t_i}$. this equation supports the theoretical model.  when talking about forces we know that $f=m g a$ where f is the sum of the net forces and (mg)a is (mass x gravity) x acceleration, therefore $a = \frac{f}{m g}$. this equation also supports the theoretical equation. we were given the equation $a=c1 x f_y+c2$ to be used with our equation $y=0.005 x+0.0931$. the end result of the formula needed to determine the hanging mass needed is below, using the values we have from our theoretical equation and the assigned acceleration. 
for the scenario of a heavy string connecting the hanging weight to the cart, the numbers would be different but the end result would be the same. you are increasing the total mass of the system, so if you increase the mass on the horizontal plane (string + cart) you would need to increase the hanging mass in order to achieve a similar acceleration. if you use the same weights as the previous string then the acceleration would be less. this can be shown algebraically $a=\frac{f}{m}$ if your mass is larger, and force remains constant, then your acceleration will be smaller. for example, let’s say f is 4 and m is 2 then $a=\frac{f}{m}$ would be a is 4/2 so 2, but if f is 4 and m is 4 then a is 4/4 so 1. a constant non-changing force and an increased mass would cause a decrease in the acceleration of the system. 

with both experiments there were both random and systematic errors involved. random errors would include some friction caused by the track. if the track was not perfectly level or part of the cart was touching the track, that friction or position of the track could have an effect on the data produced. one way to reduce any error caused by track imbalance would be to use a level and make sure that the track is completely level from end to end. also making sure that none of the air holes were blocked would help resolve any concern about parts of the track causing the cart to dip and touch the track (friction). another source of random error would be using a non-digital scale. the scale we used required a correct line of sight to determine weight of the cart and bobbers. if we were standing too high we might have produced a bad reading. we also did not recalibrate the scale after each measurement, this may have lead to systematic error from the scale not measuring correct weight of the bobbers or cart. another source of error could have been exact positioning of the cart. again we tried to be consistent with where our starting point was, but because we were using the indicated distance on the track we might have been off by a millimeter or two each time. environmental factors that may have affected the results would be air resistance. although it was most likely consistent through each trial, there may have been some instances where it affected the outcomes. not knowing doesn’t mean it can be ruled out. using the data from both lab experiments we can predict that increasing the force on a system will cause an increase in acceleration in that system.
