discussion and conclusion
	

the research question that was investigated in this lab was “does the length of the string, mass, or angle of release affect the period of oscillation of a pendulum?”. for lab day 1, we can conclude that the only variable that affects the period of oscillation of a pendulum is the length of the string. figure 1 clearly shows a positive relationship between the length of the string and the period of oscillation. as the length of the string is increased, the period increases as well. figures 2 and 3 show that even when the mass or the angle of release were changed, the period of oscillation stayed about the same. the period of oscillation did not change. for lab 2, we calculated the standard deviation of the period of oscillation for ten trials. for each trial, the mass, length of string, and angle of release were all kept constant. the standard deviation calculated was 0.0466 s. for lab 3, we can conclude that the length of the string has a positive power relationship with the period of oscillation. figure 4 shows the power relationship and displays the equation and r2 value. 

the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is t   our data  fits this model in lab 3. using the photogate allowed us to gather more accurate and precise data, which showed the curve to be power. as shown in figure 4, the equation displayed is very close to the theoretical mathematical model. g is 9.8 m/s2. taking the square root of 9.8 and dividing by 9.8 is very close to 2. that leaves , which is the same as l0.5. l and x are the same variables in this case. so, once simplified, the theoretical mathematical equation is 0.2x0.5. thus, our equation $y=0.0987275 x$ is extremely close to the theoretical equation. the r2 value is also 0.9999, which is extremely close to 1. mass and angle of release did not have any effect on the period of oscillation, which explains why these values are not in the theoretical mathematical equation. 

one possible systematic and random error that occurred was that the angle of release may not have been constant every trial. this error is systematic if the protractor used was off completely, giving us a false angle. this error would be random if the person who held the string at the angle of release point was not being careful to make sure that every time the string was pulled back, it was pulled back to the same spot. this error could be reduced by making sure the protractor is exact, or by getting a machine to pull back the string at the exact same point every time, which would keep the angle of release constant. another possible systematic error is that the weights may not all have been exactly 20g each. this is systematic because each time the weights were used, the weight that we believed the mass to be may not have been exact. this error could have been reduced by using a analytic balance for each weight used to find the exact mass of each weight used. an error that could be both systematic and random is the timing of the period of oscillation with the stopwatch. this error could be random because the person using the stopwatch is most likely not going to have perfect reaction time, thus, the time found for each trial would not have been exact. this error would be systematic if the timer was off and showing the wrong time every time it was used. this error was reduced by using the photogate system in lab 3, which gave us better reaction time, as it is a machine, and better timing as well. 

a constraint in this experiment that limits the generalizability of our results is that there was air resistance present during the experiment. if this experiment was done in a place where there was no air resistance, it would be more accurate.
