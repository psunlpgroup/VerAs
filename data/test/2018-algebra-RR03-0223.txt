discussion:

the research question that was investigated in the lab was “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?” we tested the length of the string of the pendulum, the mass of the pendulum, and the angle of release of the pendulum.

the first experiment ran tested if the length of the pendulum string impacted the time of the pendulum’s period. in this experiment, five different string lengths were tested (10cm, 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, and 50cm) against a constant angle of release (10 degrees) and constant mass of pendulum (90g). three trials were tested for each length and the average time of these three trials were taken in order to yield more accurate results for the period time. according to figure 1 of the graph of string length vs. period time, where the error bars represent plus or minus two standard deviations, the error bars only slightly overlap signifying that there is indeed a positive, linear relationship between string length and pendulum time. from this data, we can claim that string length has a direct impact on period time.

     the second experiment ran tested if the mass of the pendulum impacted the time of the pendulum’s period. in this experiment, five different masses were tested (50g, 70g, 90g, 110g, and 130g) against a constant angle of release (10 degrees) and constant string length (40cm). three trials were tested for each different mass and the average time of these trials were taken in order to yield more accurate results for the period time. according to figure2 of the graph of pendulum mass vs. period time, where the error bars represent plus or minus two standard deviations, the error bars almost completely overlap which supports the idea that there is no relationship between pendulum mass and the period time. from this data, we can claim that mass has no impact on period time. 

     the third experiment ran tested if the angle of the release of the pendulum impacted the time of the pendulum’s period. in this experiment, five different angles were tested (10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, 40 degrees, and 50 degrees) against a constant string length (40 cm) and constant mass (90 g). three trials were tested for each different angle of release and the average time of these trials were taken in order to yield more accurate results for the period time. according to figure 3 of the graph of angle of release vs. period time, where the error bars represent plus or minus two standard deviations, the error bars overlap more than they did for the string length vs. time graph but do not overlap completely like in the mass vs. time graph. this supports the idea that there is a very slight relationship between angle of release and the period time. however, this relationship is so negligible, that we can claim angle of release has no real impact on period time. 

the mathematical model, including the tables and graphs, allowed us to discover a power relationship between the independent variable of string length and the dependent variable of period length. the equation of the line from the power graph shown in figure 4 is $y=0.2995 x^{0.4234}$. the error bars are too small to be seen on the power graph. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is shown by the equation is  $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ where t is time, l is string length, and g is gravity. using this formula, it was discovered that the values from the graph of 0.2995 and 0.4234 fit closely with the expected values of 2.01 and 0.5. this confirms that the values fit the mathematical model. from observing the tables and graphs, it was concluded that mass of pendulum and angle of release do not impact period length. 

both random and systematic errors were present in this experiment. systematic errors occur when repeated measurements are either all higher or lower than the true value. random errors occur when repeated measurements have an equal chance of lying either higher or lower than the true value. two systematic errors in this experiment were that the scale could have been incorrectly calibrated resulting in an inaccurate mass of the pendulum, and there could have been a time delay on the different stop watches used. in order to reduce these systematic errors, it is important to make sure that all instruments are properly calibrated including the scale and the stopwatch. the random errors in this experiment are not releasing the pendulum from exactly the same angle every time, incorrectly measuring the length of the string, and stopping the stopwatch either too early or too late. in order to reduce these random errors, it is important to take the time of the period in multiple trials per experiment and take the average of these times in order to reduce the random error of stopping the stopwatch either too early or too late. another way to reduce random error is to refine the measurement method of techniques to properly measure string length and angle of release. 

a constraint in the physical setup of the experiment is that we were unable to test the impact of very long string lengths on period length because of the constraint of the height of the apparatus to the floor. the mathematical model is only generalizable to smaller string lengths. another constraint in the physical setup of the experiment would have been that we were unable to test the impact of a very small mass on the period time because the lowest mass testable in this lab was fifty grams. also, the mass was only able to increase by increments of twenty grams. however, because it was concluded that mass has no impact on period time, this constraint is not important.



conclusion is 

in conclusion, through experimentation and observation, we were able to determine what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. through experimentation and graphing, it was concluded that string length has a positive and linear relationship to the period of the pendulum. as the string length increases, the time for the pendulum to complete one period also increases. string length does impact the period of a pendulum. it was also concluded through experimentation and graphing that mass and period time have no relationship. mass does not impact the period of a pendulum. it was also concluded that the angle of release has a very small positive and linear relationship to period time. however, because this relationship is so small, the relationship is considered negligible. the angle of release of the pendulum does not impact the period of the pendulum. the only variable that impacts the period of a pendulum is the length of the string.
