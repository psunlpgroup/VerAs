discussion & conclusion:



the purpose of this lab was to measure and determine the effect on acceleration as the applied forces were changed. table 1 briefly explains the overview of the experiment including our independent variable (applied force) and dependent variable (acceleration). we carried out 4 trials in which we removed one mass from the cart and added it to the string each time to ensure that the total mass remained the same. this is important because it is our control variable. the cart was placed on the air track and the slope (acceleration) was determined based on a computer program that measured it on the track. table 2 shows our resulting data and the accelerations (based on grams, not kilograms) of each trial. it was as we expected that each time we added a mass to the string it would pull more and thus a higher acceleration. after the trials were completed, we graphed our data and obtained figure 1. this figure also tells us our mathematical model which is $y=0.0053 x - 0.02$ based on grams, and $y=5.3 x - 0.02$ based on kilograms. the best fit line for our graph was linear and you can tell that because of the .999 r2 value, meaning they are in almost perfect correlation with each other. the goal of week 6 was to compare our data with that of 2 other groups. figure 2 shows group 2’s data and as you see their model is almost identical to that of us (based on our model in kg). figure 3 shows group 6’s data and theirs is pretty similar, but is slightly lower than ours. they do have a very similar graph to ours in that they are both trending the same way. figure 4 is a comparison of all the classes data and again we can see that for the most part they are all pretty similar and would support the general prediction that we had. figure 5 shows the free body diagram and generally all the forces acting upon the mass on the string and the cart. it shows gravity working on both as well as tension working on both. the cart has the addition forces of a very small amount of friction and then also the normal force. all of the forces impacting the mass on the string and the cart have a direct effect on acceleration, as does mass. in each of the equations in table 2 we know that the slope of the equation is the acceleration, we also know that acceleration is equal to force/mass, so in turn we know that mass is effecting acceleration in that equation, and in the mathematical model as well. as long as there is the same amount of mass on the cart at all times then all the other forces acting on the system should remain the same, thus the acceleration should be uniform the whole time that it is on the air track.

 in this experiment there could’ve been random error due to the measuring of the bobbers if the scale was not read by the same person they could’ve obtained different numbers. in this case, you would want to make sure that you are having the same person measure multiple times or have multiple people read it and agree on the measurement. there could’ve been random error if the release point of the cart was different every time. this could easily be fixed by marking where you started every time.  systematic error could’ve occurred if the computer program or measuring device was not functioning correctly or properly reading and might’ve been reading above or below accurate the whole time. making sure you have properly calibrated and working equipment the whole time. there are limitations in this experiment because we only had one experimental design. if we were able to do it on different surfaces with different amounts of friction or maybe use something besides bobbers results could be different. overall, these limitations wouldn’t affect our results too much because the principle is still the same.
