discussion and conclusion

the research question of how does the acceleration of a system change with respect to difference to the applied force was addressed by creating an experiment in which varying masses of bobs were placed on a hanging mass string (simulating the applied force) that was attached to a cart (with varying masses of bobs attached to the cart itself) mounted on an air-track system (simulating a frictionless surface for the cart). 
the bob amount in both the hanging mass and the cart were altered accordingly to each other in ascending order in which the amount of bobs on the hanging mass was gradually increased each trial from 1 to 8 bobs and the remaining amount of bobs available (8 total for all trials (between both locations)) were placed on the cart. after placing the right amount of bobs, the cart (placed on the air-track system) was let go and the acceleration of the cart measured by a device connected to a computer for instant and relatively accurate feedback. based on the experiment created a claim was made that if the mass (in bobs) on the string of the pulley was increased, then the cart’s velocity would also increase. conversely, if the mass on top of the cart was increased, then the velocity of the cart would decrease. additionally, the acceleration of the system would remain consistent. the results shown in table 1 (see above) and figure 1 (see above) seem to corroborate such claims as it was found that as the force on the string (measured in newtons) was increased (a proportional value to the mass of the bobs on the pulley), the acceleration of the cart (measured in m/s^2) increased as well. such a correlation was characterized by a seemingly linear relationship. it should also be noted in the graph that the error bar values in the vertical and horizontal were small enough that the bars themselves did not appear on the graph itself (.5 (g) for horizontal) (.001 (m/s^2) for vertical). these error values reflect the degree of uncertainty of the measurement devices used to attain the measurements of mass of the bobs (horizontal error) and the acceleration of the cart system (vertical error). 
in comparing the findings of group 3g1b to that of this group it was found that the the equation that group 3g1b derived of $y=0.0046961 x - 0.00084$ was relatively similar that of this group. it was noted however, that group 3g1b produced a much smaller friction force value, yet the slope value remain more similar in keeping within approximately .005 units of that of this group. thus, it could be said that the results of group 3g1b supported those of this group.
the results of this group was also compared with those of a second group named group #1. in doing so it was found that the the equation that group group #1 derived of $y=0.0053 x$ was also relatively similar that of this group. it was also noted however, that like group 3g1b , group #1 produced a much smaller friction force value, yet the slope value remain much more similar in keeping within approximately .0002 units of that of this group. thus, it could be said that the results of group group #1 supported those of this group.
the theoretical model for the acceleration of a system by a single force was found to be $y =\frac{x}{m} + c$. this translated to .0053x once the appropriate values were used.
the experimental mathematical model was found to be $y = 0.0051 x - 0.0529$. the experimental mathematical model can be concluded to support the theoretical model because the slope value obtained of .0051x is close to that of .0053x found in the theoretical model. the discrepancy in values however, can most likely be attributed to frictional force since the theoretical model assumes no frictional forces are acting in the system, however, in the environment of the experiment it exists through air friction and friction between the cart and its tracks.   
the correct enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by more than one force was found to be $y =c1 x + c2$, where c2 represented frictional force or other factors divided by the mass of the system, c1 represented 1 divided by the mass of the system and x represented the force of the hanging mass. this equation simplified to $y= 0.0053x + c$.
the experimental mathematical model was again found to be $y = 0.0051 x - 0.0529$. thus, experimental mathematical model can be concluded to support the theoretical model because the slope value obtained of .0051x is close to that of .0053x found in the theoretical model. the discrepancy in values however, can most likely be attributed to frictional force (as mentioned previously).
if a heavy string was connecting the hanging weight with the cart, it is likely that the acceleration of the cart system would decrease. this is reasoning is because if the mass of the bobs on both the end of the string and the cart were to remain consistent, then the external force applied to the cart system could be concluded to remain consistent. but, if the string were to retain a mass, then the mass of the heavy string would actually contribute to the mass of the cart system, thus increasing the mass of the cart system in general. consequently, the acceleration of the cart system would decrease, because since $f = m a$ according to newton’s second law, dividing the same value f (force) value by an increased m (mass) value would result in a decrease a (acceleration) value.
no notable sources of random error were encountered during the experiment. one instance of systematic error that could have impacted the results of the experiment were that some unnecessary and unintentional force could have been applied to the cart system during its launching process driving it forward, and therefore contributing to a greater increase in the acceleration of the cart. a method to reduce such could be to use an automated releasing mechanism that would eliminate the need for direct human contact, thus producing more consistent releases without added force.
some obvious constraints to the experiment were that the experiment was not conducted within a truly frictionless environment (both from the contact of the cart to the track system and the encounterance of air friction from the movement of the cart). although these constraints were of little general concern in this particular experiment since the phenomenon being research was already widely understood, if this were not the case, then such results could not be used to make any generalizations because of the confounding variables previously discussed that consistently would affect the true results of the experiment.
