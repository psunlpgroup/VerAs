conclusion: 
we conducted an experiment that tested how an applied force would impact the acceleration of a system and the mathematical relationship between the force applied, as the independent variable, and the acceleration, as the dependent variable. possible factors included the friction acting on the system, the gravity acting on the system, the mass of the system and the tension on the system. by keeping these factors constant, it allowed for us to test only the impact of the force of the hanging mass on the acceleration of the system. after collecting data of our trials regarding seven different masses and forces as shown in table 2, we graphed the points as shown in figure 1. our mathematical model was concluded to be $y=5.1898 x - 0.0297$. the slope was calculated to be 5.1898 with an r^2 value to be 0.9899. with an r^2 value very close to one, it indicates that the relationship between the force applied to a system and its acceleration is significant, allowing it to be determined that the force applied impacts the acceleration of a system, in that as the hanging mass of the system is increased, the acceleration increased, supporting our hypothesis. findings from groups 3 and 4 also concluded that the force due to hanging mass affected the acceleration. group 3’s mathematical model $y=4.3797 x + 0.002$ as seen in table 3, only had a slope difference of 0.8101 compared to our mathematical model. group 4’s mathematical model $y=4.6131 x - 0.4991$ as seen in table 3, only had a slope difference of 0.5767 compared to our mathematical model. both group 3 and 4’s r^2 values were close to one also indicating a relationship between the force applied to a system and its acceleration is significant. group 3’s r^2 value was calculated at 0.9937, as shown in table 3. group 4’s r^2 value was calculated at 0.93805, as shown in table 3. the difference in our r^2 value and group 3 and 4 were 0.0038 and 0.05185 respectively. the theoretical model relating force and acceleration is $f=m a$,  $a=\frac{f}{m}$. our mathematical model somewhat fits this model in that the slope of the line is roughly equal to the reciprocal of the mass of the system. the mass of the system was 0.1824kg. the reciprocal of the mass of the system would be 1/m which is 5.4825. our calculated slope was 5.1898 resulting in only a 0.2927 difference, and error of 5.3%. however, the theoretical model has a y-intercept equal to zero. our y-intercept has a negative value, suggesting that acceleration would have a non-zero value when force equals zero. this does not conform to reality. this discrepancy may arise from the fact that, in establishing our model, we assumed friction to be negligible. however, when the hanging mass is relatively small and the mass on the cart is relatively large, friction may become a non-negligible force acting on the system, distorting our model. friction on the system would also consistently cause us to overestimate the force generated by the hanging mass with the force of gravity and the acceleration of the system. this is an example of systematic error. that said, since force and acceleration are both overestimated equally, the mathematical relationship between the two should not be affected by this error. other systematic errors could arise from uncalibrated scales, resulting in incorrect mass of the system affecting the force applied to the system. error could be reduced by ensuring the scale is calculated and calculating the force of friction on the system and including it in our calculations. if the string was to have an appreciable mass, it would affect the acceleration. this is because when the cart is started there is a small portion of string that is added to the hanging mass that is pulling the cart, so when the cart is further down the track there will be more string that will be added to the hanging mass causing acceleration to increase slightly.
constraints in the experiment involve the mass of the weight being tested, and the acceleration of the system. the weight was constrained because we were only given a certain amount of weights. also, if the weight was too extreme it could have broken the string, not allowing for the string to hang and causing the force of the hanging mass and the system to accelerate. the acceleration was constrained because there was a limited distance the system could accelerate on the air track.
