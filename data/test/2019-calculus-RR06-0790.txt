conclusion:

 the purpose of doing this two-week lab was to do a couple things. one of them was to develop mathematical models that will shown you the behavior of a real system, this was for the first week. the second goal of the lab was to try and understand the different variables and the numbers that were in the equations from the first week.

 all three of the experiments helped me understand the meaning of the variables and numbers in the mathematical models we found. the first two experiments did because they helped us create the mathematical models. the third experiment helped us determined what the c2 variable was and what affects it. in our first mathematical model $y=2.6295 x - 0.0488$ the y variable is the acceleration, the coefficient to the variable x is c1 and that stands for the mass to the -1 power. the variable x stands for the force applied (hanging mass). the -.04882 is the force unknown, it is something like friction or air resistance that is nearly impossible to get rid of because our lab setting was not perfect. the other mathematical model $y=0.0144 x^{3.021}$ the y stands for the acceleration, the x stands for the force applied (hanging mass) in this form the coefficient of x is still c1 but c2 has been moved to the exponent, so it is equal to 3.021. 


group 2 did almost the same experiment as us and had very similar resuts. there data agrees with ours even though there value are slightly different then ours for c1. the c2 value all have a negative sign while ours are all positive but that is becuase they tilted the other end of the system, so there results agree with ours. group 4’s experiment was different then the one we performed because they added on to the force normal of the cart. this caused an increase in the c2 value which is the force unknown. this is consistent with what we thought because it would be a greater force friction even thought there wasn’t suppose to be one. there is a small amount with the cart and what it slid on and this increased as magnets were added to it.

 in every experiment we do there will almost always be some form of error. in this experiment there could have been a slight amount of air resistance which would have been systematic error because all of the data points would have been equally affected by this. another possible source of error could have come from friction with the surface. even though we were using the things that are supposed to be frictionless nothing is perfect and the more mass we added to the cart could have added the slightest amount of friction which would have also been a type of systematic error. in order to reduce these errors, we took multiple measurements at each interval either 5 or 8 trials. this would have helped and limited any random error that could have occurred, and this would have made sure the systematic error was consistent.

 although this experiment was very well executed, i thought, a couple restraints could have been the equipment we were using we were never one hundred percent sure that the track was always frictionless, that could have skewed our data and cause some error in the experiment another constraint could have been the weights we used. we could have used a more effective ways to add mass to the cart or the hanging mass that would have been more consistent and accurate than fishing bobbers.

 our models are consistent with the experimental mathematical models for the most part. our first model $y=2.6295 x - 0.0488$ is just like the equation $f=m a$, just in a different form of $a=\frac{f}{m}$, m is on the bottom that’s why the coefficient of x has units of 1/m and the subtracted force -.04882 is the force unknown which could be any form of friction or error in the experiment in ideal conditions this would be equal to zero. the second mathematical model $y=0.0144 x^{3.021}$ is a little but off of what it should be. it still has the correct form where c2 now becomes the exponent but that value for c2 is much larger than it should be and the value for c1 the coefficient of x is much smaller than it should be.
