conclusion:
 when researching was factors effect the time it takes for a pendulum to swing we changed the mass, angle, and length of the pendulum. the first that we tested was changing the mass hanging and our initial prediction thought it would change the period of the swing it in fact stayed constant. the second test had the angle of the pendulum changed while everything else was constant and our prediction that it would not affect the period was correct. the third and final test had the length of the pendulum change and the prediction of a longer string creating a longer period was correct and very accurate. the first and second experiment are shown to have no relationship to period as the slope of the graphs are essentially zero meaning that even when changed the period remains the same. when performing the third experiment a model of $t=0.0153 l + 0.618$ was found to show the relationship of the length of the string and the period of the pendulum. the margin of error when creating this model was very small as a very accurate way of measuring was used. the first three graphs are shown to be a bit more random and rougher because of human error when using stopwatches to measure creating error in the experiment. the fourth graph, however, is a lot more precise and accurate because a machine with a very small margin of error was used, these data points therefore reflect our predictions the most accurately. measurements of uncertainty were found by taking the standard deviation and variance of the data points for the first three graphs, while the fourth used a machine that displayed the margin of error.
