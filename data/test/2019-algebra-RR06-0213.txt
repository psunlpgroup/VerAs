conclusion:

the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model. the two experiments that we conducted led to our mathematical models in that hanging weight affects the acceleration of a system in a linear way. that is, the more hanging weight of the system leads to more acceleration in a linear fashion. we also concluded that magnets affect the acceleration in that the closer the magnets were to the track the less acceleration there was. you can see this by looking at the three mathematical models in experiment 6. the linear model gets larger as the magnets move farther away from the track.
group 5 drew this on their whiteboard. by the equation $a=\frac{f}{m}$ you can see that acceleration is direction related to force of the system. so as force gets larger the acceleration also gets larger. you can see the free body diagrams of the cart and the hanging weight and the equations that they produce. all of these things that they wrote help back up our claim in that acceleration is directly related to the force.
some errors that were present in the data could have been the points we selected on the computer, how the bobbers were placed, and how much air was going through the air track. the points selected on the computer could have affected the results in that if we selected points that were before the cart actually started moving or after the cart hit the bumper at the end then the equation and mathematical model would be different. another error that could have taken place is that were the bobbers were placed on the cart. if there was more in the front or more in the back that could affect weight distribution of the cart thus affecting the acceleration of the cart. the last error that could have affected the data is the amount of air that was going through the track. there could have been more or less air in certain runs. if there was more air flowing through the track, it would be much easier for the cart to glide on it. this could affect the acceleration of the cart by making it either easier or harder to move on the track.
a constraint of this experiment was that we did not have the most precise equipment to measure the weights of everything we used. the scale we used was only accurate to 1 gram. if we had a scale that was more precise we could have the data be more accurate because the measurements of the hanging weight and the cart would be very accurate.
the mathematical models that we came up with are consistent with newton in that it shows a direct linear relationship between the force of a system and acceleration.
