discussion and conclusion

through the course of this experiment, we were able to test our research question, “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?” and come to a definite conclusion. the overall purpose for this lab was to be able to design and conduct a controlled experiment to determine a mathematical model from experimental data and apply the mathematical model to predict outcome. the mathematical model derived from the experiment corresponding with table 1 and table 4 is $y=0.0051 x - 0.017$ with an r^2 value of 0.9978. this model makes sense because the data ends up being linear with a high r^2 value. the mathematical model derived from the experiment corresponding with table 2 and table 5 (data received from group 3) is $y=0.051 x - 0.393$. the mathematical model derived from the experiment corresponding with table 3 and table 6 (data received from group 6) is $y=0.0533 x + 0.0156$. all of these results support our own group’s claim.
