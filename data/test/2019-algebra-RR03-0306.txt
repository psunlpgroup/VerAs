discussion and conclusion: 
we were determining which factors had an impact on the period length of the pendulum. the first factor we tested was string length. to carry out this experiment we had to keep certain constants every time we changed the length of the string making it the independent variable. this will help us determine if this one factor will affect the period length. the period length is the dependent variable for each factor we tested. we concluded that the string length had the biggest impact on period length than any other factor. as the string length got longer, the period length increased in time. according to the graph, it had the steepest slope of all the factors. the second factor we tested was the weight of the pendulum. each trial we added 40g to the pendulum while keeping the angle and string length constant making the weight the independent variable. this factor had the least impact on the period of the pendulum swing. the graph is essentially horizontal with very little decline. the third and final factor we tested was angle of release. to carry out this experiment we changed the angle at which we released the pendulum while keeping all other factors constant. this had a slight impact on our period time. we concluded that when the angle of release is increased, the period time also slightly increases. there was random error during these trials. these could have been from starting and stopping the stopwatches incorrectly. another possibility is incorrectly measuring the angle each time the pendulum was released. systematic error that could have occurred is from the amount of pressure needed to click the start/stop button on the stopwatch causing the time to be off. one way to avoid the error is to take a video of 1 period and break it down frame by frame to get exact results. we could have also used stopwatches with less stiff buttons. finding standard deviation helps us determine how accurate our recordings were due to error. our confidence in the error was + or â€“ 2(sigma), or value + or - 0.14877.  due to the 2(sigma) error criterion we can no longer state that we are sure that the string length and angle of release affect the period length of the pendulum since there is overlap between all the plotted variables when 2(sigma) error is applied. due to the overlapping of the error bars, we could not determine if any of them affected the period length. we mainly focused on string length due to our overlapping.  it had a theoretical equation of       $y=0.0114 x + 0.9461$           with an r^2 number of 0.9965. theoretically our expected period length would have been 1.5161s for a .5m pendulum. our actual time was very close to that at 1.509s. the only constraints we had were time. this caused us to be unable to fix certain mistakes that could have been avoided.
