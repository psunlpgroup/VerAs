conclusion:

the period of a pendulum that has small swings is changed by what independent variables? to come to a conclusion my group and i tested three variables to see how they would affect the period. the first variable we tested was changing the mass of the pendulum. after performing four tests we discovered that mass has no affect on the period of the pendulum. this can be seen on the graph, “mass of pendulum vs. time for 5 periods”, the error bars are overlapping which means that there is no change in the time in which five periods were completed. next, we tested how the angle at which the pendulum was released affects the period. after performing four tests we concluded that there was no correlation between the angle of release and the time it took to complete four periods. despite having an outlier due to a random error, the graph, “angle of release vs. time for 5 periods” shows that the error bar overlap. this proves that the angle of release, equal to or less than 30 degrees, does not directly influence the time of the period. lastly, we tested the affects that the length of the string from which the pendulum hung would have on the period. after four tests we found that the shorter the length of the string the shorter the time would be to complete the periods. in the graph for the variable, “length of string vs. time of 5 periods”, it is shown that the error bars do not overlap further proving that there is a difference between the times when the string lengths are different. 

in the end the mathematical model we got when for the time it takes a pendulum to complete one period when released from an angle that is equal to or less than 30 degrees is $y=0.2077 x^{0.491}$ and r^2 is 0.9999. my group and i are 99% confident in the model we created because when compared to lab group 2’s mathematical model, it was very similar. there equations were, $y=0.20847 x^{0.4541}$  and r^2 is 0.9998. the differences in our equations most likely occurred from random errors. these errors may have been human error such as not measuring the exact value, recording incorrect times, not hitting the stop watch exactly when the trials started or ended. there may also be systematic errors with the equipment used in the experiment, although the last test with the photogate is supposed to lower random errors, if the photogate was not producing the correct reading then that would also cause error within our final data. there were also some constraints that may have influenced our outcomes. for example, time was a constraint because when time was running low in the allotted time we could be in the lab, things may have been rushed and not precisely executed. there was also the constraint of having limited options of what values were testable like the angle at which the pendulum was released was only allowed to be 30 degrees or less. the height at which we hung the pendulum was constrained due to how long our string was and how far we could possibly hang it and another constraint would be how much mass we could place on the pendulum because we had a set amount that we could have used.
