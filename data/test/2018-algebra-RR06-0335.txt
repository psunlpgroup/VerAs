Discussion and Conclusion

The purpose of the lab was to figure out how the acceleration of the system would change when the applied force changes. In our experiment, we determined an experimental model that is related to the theoretical mathematical model; which is Newton’s Second Law, $F = m a$ where m was measured in kg and the acceleration was measured in m/s^2. The experimental mathematical model was a linear equation, $y = m x + b$. where y was equal to our acceleration (m/s^2), m was 1/m, x was equal to the force (N), and b was equal to the friction. In our experiment we were able to determine if there was friction acting upon the system but usually with Newton’s Second Law you cannot usually tell if there will be friction present or not. Other than the hanging weight, there is the normal force, tension, gravity. If the string had no mass attached to it then the cart did not move. The cart did not move in a uniform direction because it would start off slow and then speed up.  There were multiple random and systematic errors in this experiment. Some random errors were the cart not starting at the exact same spot every time, the place where the bobs were put, the string not being placed properly, and not starting/or keeping the vacuum on long enough. These errors could be fixed by doing more trials or getting a newer equipment that would run more smoothly. Some systematic errors were the vacuum, the car on the track not running smoothly, the program on the computer. These errors could be fixed by getting a new equipment. These errors could have restricted the full ability of our lab effecting our results.
