concluding:

	the correct theoretical model for this representation is $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. this model relates to the model we received in experiment 5 ($a = 0.0028 f - 0.0052$), by showing that as the mass of the hanging object increases, the acceleration of that system is going to increase. the slope is equal to the force that the hanging mass applies, and as our graph clearly shows, there is a clear, direct, positive relationship between the two. although the entire mass of the system stays the same, the force that the hanging mass applies will change. our graph gives us 2 very small values for c1 and c2 in the equation, which i believe represent the force from f1 which the tension of the string is pushing away from the sled to the right and c2 is the frictional force that pushes towards the sled against the tension force from the hanging mass. the enhanced mathematical model is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. this is explained using our data from both labs. the c1 from the mathematical model that was 0.0028 is much different than experiment 6, which increased from a minimum of 0.0221 (2 magnets) to 0.0342 (no magnets). it must be due to the increased mass of the system which is now 397g, greater than the previous mass from lab 5 which was 331.68g. there could also be more frictional force involved in this lab to have c1 to be a higher value as well as c2 to have a bigger y-intercept.  therefore, from the looks of our data, we can say that our experimental model definitely supports the theoretical model.

	if the we had a heavy string connecting the hanging mass and the car, then our mass of the overall system would change because we have to take into account the mass of the heavy string. when we do that, we are increasing the mass of the system, which in return, decreases the acceleration of the system.

	there are multiple different types of errors that could have taken place throughout the course of these two experiments. a random error that could have occurred could include the measurement of masses, which would affect the overall force. a systematic error that could have taken place involves air track, and whether it was performing to its full potential, or only at half power and so on.

some constraints that would affect the generalizability of these labs include the material of the air track. changing from metal to another material could affect how we carry out this experiment. also, we were only given a certain amount of weights and masses to work with, and if we were given a wider range of masses, we could better represent our findings in a clear manner.
