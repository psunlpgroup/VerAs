conclusion:
To start this experiment, my lab partners and I were asked the following question: How does the acceleration of the entire system change when the applied force and mass change? To which we decided to answer by setting up an experiment. We set up three different experiments to test various independent variables. 

First, we set up an experiment to test how mass affects acceleration. We tested this by having a slider set up on a vacuum-powered rail. There would also be a string attached to the slider going over a frictionless pulley system that could have bobbers attached to the end of the string, simulating applied force through the tension in the string. We could change the mass by adding slotted weights to the top of the slider. We predicted that the mass would have an inverse relationship with the acceleration, meaning that as the mass increased, the acceleration would decrease. Our experiment supported our results as the line given from the graph of the experiment was is  $y = 1.78 e^{-0.017x}$. The trials were close to the inverse proportionally-fit line showing us that are results are accurate. Even when we doubled the data, because of the equivalency criterion, the results were still showing there was really nothing affecting the period.

Other group’s data proved that our data was accurate as well. Their data was similar to ours in that they also got an inverse relationship and the line was fit in the same way, but their graph’s line was is  $y = 2.34 e^{-0.003 }$. They also predicted that they’d get an inverse relationship.

Next, we set up an experiment to test how applied force affects acceleration. We tested this through the same slider and rail system, but instead we were adding mass to the end of the string to simulate tension force applied. We added a new bobber each trial. We predicted that the applied force would have a linear relationship with acceleration, meaning that as the force applied increased, the acceleration would also increase. This is because of Newton’s Second Law is  Force applied is equal to mass times acceleration. Our experiment supported our results as the line given from the graph of our experiment was is  $y = 0.0024 x + 0.014$. The trials were almost exactly accurate to the linear-fit line as the R2 value shows that we were 99.89% of the fit of the line. Even when we doubled the data, because of the equivalency criterion, the results were still showing there was really nothing affecting the period.

Other group’s data proved that this data was accurate because their line was similar to ours. They also predicted the linear relationship and were satisfied with their end result. The other group’s graph’s line was is  .013x + .0297. Our data was a little more accurate, shown through the y-intercept, but they still helped support our prediction.

The main theoretical equation for this experiment, newton’s second law, is $F=m a$. This equation supports our data not only because it shows the relationships between acceleration and force/mass, but also because it can prove how accurate our data was. It shows the relationships simply by solving for F and m. $F=m a$, so when the force is doubled, if the mass is constant, the acceleration will also be doubled. $m=\frac{f}{a}$, so when the force is constant the mass and the acceleration will have an inverse relationship. This is proved in our data points. In trial 5 from Table 5, we see that when the force is constant and the mass is 200g then the acceleration is .135. Whcich is similar to the theoretical result which would be .178.

The enhanced theoretical equation for all of the experiments tested is as follows is  
$a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. To get the full effect of this equation, we tested the same experiment but using magnets to see if these external forces could cause a difference. So, if we plug in a data point from above, for example we’ll use F is 356.72N and m is 50g from trial 2 of table 5, we should get the same results in accordance with data we obtained from the magnets experiment. In that example of trial 2 from table 5, the resulting acceleration was shown to be .659m/s2. The mass of the system would be roughly 351g (.351kg) if you add the slider and the mass of the trial. The external force would be coming from the magnets, making it roughly 355N. If you plug in all of the data from above, you still get the acceleration to be roughly .659m/s2.
