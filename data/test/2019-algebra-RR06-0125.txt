Discussion and Conclusion:
 The purpose of lab 05 was developing mathematical models to describe the behavior of a system. The purpose of lab 06 was to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value in the system model.
 In the two experiments in lab 05, the group changed either the applied force or the mass of the sliding car respective to each individual experiment. We then recorded the acceleration of the system with a computer program. Putting this data into a scatter plot chart have us our experimental equations. 
For the first experiment in lab 05, the applied force was our independent variable. Our equation was $a  = 2.8941 f_{applied}-0.0372$. We determined the constant 2.8941 has units of 1/kg, and the constant -0.0372 has units of m/s2.
For the second experiment in lab 05, the mass of the sliding cart was our independent variable was $a  = -2.6375 m +1.9567$. We determined the constant -2.6375 has units of 1/kg, and the constant 1.9567 has units of m/s2.
In lab 06, the group made the friction of the sliding system the independent variable. We tested three different friction forces by using magnets, with each having five trials. An acceleration vs friction (applied force) graph was plotted, giving three different equations. With 0 added magnets our equation was $ a = 2.7858 f_{applied}-0.0155$. Constant 2.7858 has units of 1/kg, and the constant -0.0155 has units of m/s2.
With 2 added magnets our equation was $a  = 0.7622 f_{applied} - 0.0575$. Constant 0.7622 has units of 1/kg, and the constant -0.0575 has units of m/s2.
With 4 added magnets our equation was $a = 0.4672 f_{applied}-0.0318$. Constant 0.4672 has units of 1/kg, and the constant -0.0318 has units of m/s2.

There were no other groups that were able to provide a whiteboard with our same hypothesis.  Groups 1 and 2 had hypothesized for an inclined plane. They both had similar equations around 2.8x+0.01 or 2.9x+0.01. Our trendline equations fluctuated throughout our various trials. The IV that they tested had a smaller impact on the DV of their experiment while our IV had a larger impact on the DV.
 In lab 05, there could have been random error in the applied force. Our group had only weighed one bobber and assumed that all other bobbers weighed the same. This could be fixed by weighing all the bobber individually.
 I do not believe that there were any constraints in either lab that reduced the generalizability of our results.
 By keeping mass constant in the equation $F=m a$, the force and acceleration should have a direct relationship where if one increases, the other will also increase. In the first experiment in lab 05 where the mass was kept constant, the data shows that increasing the applied force did indeed increase the acceleration. This holds the equation $F=m a$ to be true. In lab 06, the mass was also kept constant and the data of all three tests showed as well that increasing the applied force also increased the acceleration.
