conclusion:

does the string length, bell weight or release angle have any effect on the period of a pendulum.

in our first experiment (string length vs. period) addressed the first part of our research question, that being does string length affect the period of a pendulum? our claim following this experiment is that as the length of the pendulum increases the period increases and, conversely, if the length of the string decreases than the period decreases. this claim remains valid provided that any tested change in string length is not so minute that it causes its point on the graph (figure 1) to be within 0.004 seconds of any other graphed points. as can be seen in figure one if this were to happen it would be uncertain if the points that were within 0.004 seconds of each other were different at all. this, of course, being due to the 0.002 second uncertainty of each of the 2 points. 

in our second experiment (bell weight vs. period) we addressed the second part of our research question, that being does bell weight have any effect on the period of a pendulum? our claim following this experiment was that although there appeared to be no correlation between the bell weight and period, we cannot be certain due to the errors of all of the points in the graph overlapping (see figure 2.) this will remain a valid claim unless the position of the points on the y-axis are actually different and error is reduced to a point where the uncertainties of each point do not overlap.

in our third experiment (release angle vs. period) we addressed the third and final part of our research question, that being does the release angle affect the period of a pendulum. our claim following this experiment was that although there seemed to be a positive correlation between release angle and the period, due to overlap in the range of uncertainties of the points on the graph in figure 3 we cannot be sure of this. this claim will remain valid unless the range of uncertainties between the graphed points on figure 3 were reduced to the point that even under 2 times sigma (or error times 2) conditions the uncertainties failed to overlap. under these specific conditions we would then be able to validly claim that a correlation between release angle and period did exist (provided that the graphed points on figure three remained the same.)

 the theoretical mathematical model for a pendulum’s period is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. the data from our first experiment (figure 1 and table 1a) fits this theoretical model remarkably well, displaying the linear relationship between string length and period that is suggested by the theoretical model. the data from our second experiment, in spite of not showing a correlation (seen in figure 2 and table 2a), also fits the theoretical model since the theoretical model does not include bell weight as a factor that can influence a pendulum’s period. the data from our third experiment also lines us somewhat well with the theoretical model. the data from our third experiment failed to show a correlation between release angle and period (see figure 3 and table 3a), a result that agrees with the theoretical model since, along with bell weight, the release angle is also not included as a factor that can influence the period of a pendulum.

one of the sources of error that was encountered was the random error associated with timing the period of a pendulum with a person using a stopwatch. this error was reduced (for experiment 1 only) via using a photogate to record period. this was a significant improvement since the photogate has a very small, known error of 0.001 seconds associated with it. by applying this method to the other two experiments that we did the error from the stopwatch time sampling method would be reduced considerably there as well. another source of error was that for all three of the experiments the release angle was measured manually and the pendulum was released manually. these error sources could result in the pendulum being released at an inconsistent angle. both of these error sources could be significantly reduced via the use of a mechanical release mechanism that could release the pendulum at a constant time and angle.

 two constraints that could have potentially affected the generalizability of our experiments were that we were not able to alter the gravity or the air density of our experimental conditions. if gravity has an effect on the period of a pendulum (which it does) than our results may not remain applicable to a similar experiment if done somewhere other than on the earth. likewise if air density has an effect on the period of a pendulum than our results may not be applicable to a similar experiment done in a place with reduced air density, such as on top of a mountain or in a vacuum.
