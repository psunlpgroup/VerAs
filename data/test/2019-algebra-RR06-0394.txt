discussion and conclusion:



the research question that was being tested in lab 5 was to see how the acceleration of the system change when the applied force was changed. the research question was approached by seeing how the acceleration of system changed (dv) when the mass that was hanging off of the system changed (iv). the control variable was the total mass of the cart with the bobbers. the data collected shows that there is a positive linear relationship ( figure 1.1) between the hanging mass and the acceleration. this develop our mathematical model which w$a=2.9325 f - 0.0195$. to figure out acceleration for the system, you could plug in applied force into x in the equation above. this showed that the higher value for the applied force, the greater the acceleration. this helps to understand the next lab because you could break the mathematical model to figure out the variables and numerical values for lab 6. the second part of lab 5 tested how total mass (iv) had an effect on the acceleration (dv) of the system. the results showed that there was a negative exponential correlation between mass and the acceleration of the system ( figure 1.2). this experiment was important in understanding lab 6 because it determine the control variable for lab 6, which was total mass because the research question was trying to test for friction and not acceleration. it also helped understand that is you increased mass the acceleration decreased. this also supports the theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. 
in lab 6, the research question being tested was to see how friction impacts the acceleration of the system. by using the experimental model ( $y=c1 x+c2$) from the previous experiment ( lab5), you could determine that, $a=\frac{f_{applied} +f_{friction}}{m_{sys}}$(force applied n)/(msys)+(force friction)/(msys). this then determine that $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ because forced applied had an positive correlation from last lab ( lab 5). our experimental c2 value from lab 5 was -.0195 which meant that this force was acting opposite to the system. to test for friction magnets were placed on the sides of the system. the result showed that c2 became smaller when more friction was added. ( figures 1.3,1.4,1.5) 
above is a picture of a group that tested the same hypothesis as us. you can see that their r squared values also are close to 1, very similar to ours. also, their c2 values are different from ours in regards that their c2 values increased while ours decreased as you increased the magnets. since we resembling hypotheses and conclusions, this increases our confidence in the data we ended up with. 
above is a picture of a group that tested a separate hypothesis than us. with their r squared values being for the most part close to 1, indicating that the points on their graph for their trendline well. therefore, we can conclude that their information is accurate. their c2 values were similar to our in regards that as they increased the magnets the c2 value went down. with the being said, we can conclude that their independent variable had a smaller impact on the numerical values. 
there was many possible errors that occur during this lab. possible random errors could have been that the mass of the whole system could have been measured inaccurately due to human error which could not have been noticed, which would cause us the use the wrong mass the whole time leading to inaccurate data. this could have been reduced by weighing each mass individually and then adding all the masses together to get a more accurate final mass. a systematic error could have been that the data studio may not have been calibrated properly leading to inaccurate readings which we would then use to move forward with the experiment. this error could have been reduced by making sure that data studio was working properly before the experiment was started.
a constraint during this lab was time. if we have unlimited time then we could have made sure that the equipment was properly calibrated and the masses of the system were properly weighed.
our two experimental mathematical models are consistent with newton’s second law because they can both equal $f=m a$. in $a= 2.9325 f - 0.0195$, it is consistent with the theoretical model which is $a=c1 f+c2$. in newton’s second law ,  which is the same as $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ when trying to figure c1f. in the second experimental mathematical model $a= 0.0524 x^{-.877}$, which makes $a=f m_{sys}^{-1}$. both equations stay true to newton’s second law.
