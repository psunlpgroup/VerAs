discussion and conclusion:

what impacts the period of a pendulum? there are a few factors considered and tested; however, the period of the pendulum is not impacted by mass. as you can see by the graph above when mass is taken as an independent variable the period of not affected. the slope is essentially zero indicating no change in the period and the error bars are all overlapped again indicating the period is not changing. therefore, the period of a pendulum is not affected by mass. while mass does not affect the period of a pendulum length of the string certainly does. if you refer to the graph above corresponding to the length of string you will see there is a positive correlation between the length of the string and the period. it shows that as the length of the string is increased the period of the pendulum increases as well. as you can also tell the error bars on this graph are very small and our standard deviation came out to be 0.017 which indicated that our data did not change and stayed fairly consistent.  there is a direct relationship between the angle at which the pendulum is released and the period. although, the error bars appear to be rather larger and the standard deviation is 0.186, the graph shows a positive correlation between the angle and the period. although, the graph does indicate that there is no relationship between the angle and the period what the angle is less than or equal to 20 degrees. the error bars are overlapping, and those four points appear to have a zero slope. therefore, angle and the period have a positive relationship when the angle is greater than 20 degrees, such that, when the angle increase the period increases. 

the relationship between the period and the length of the string is non-linear. the power law graph fit our graph the best. this is different than what we predicted in the earlier graph because we had less data and bigger error bars. the equation for our graph came out to be $t=2 \sqrt{l}$. our graph fits the mathematical model because x is length, l, and that is raised to the power of ½ which is also the square root. the coefficient of l is equal to 2pi/sqrt(l), which is equal to 2 and matches the coefficient for our x-value. 

some random errors that occurred in this lab are timing. we were limited the measurement in time, in that, we could only estimate to a hundredth of a second. when measuring with the measuring tape we could only estimate to a millimeter. as well as the person taking the measurement and how they decide to make their guess of uncertainty. 

ways to reduce these random errors could be by taking multiple measurements and finding the average. using different timing devices, like using all stop watches for one trial and all iphone timers for another, etc. the person who takes the measurements and how they take it is repeated and cannot be changed throughout the course of the experiment. 

some of the constraints within this experiment include, the tools we were given to use, the location, and the time. we were limited to what we were able to use. we were given specific tools to work with that were varied in age and condition. we also were given a specific location and time to complete the experiment. so, in the way that the tools we were given could’ve been worn, this could mean that our data is slightly off. also, the location would vary our data in the way that our location is on a flat surface compared to another group of people who did this experiment on top of a mountain on a rocky surface. finally, the time would just affect the speed and we were doing our experiment, if we were running out of time and we were reading numbers fast and carelessly the data would be slightly off.
