discussion and conclusion

	the goal of this set of experiments was to answer the question: what factors affect the period of a pendulum?  this question was answered by testing 3 variables is  mass of pendulum bob, angle of release, and length of pendulum string.  we tested all these variables separately, selecting one to change and test at a time.

	when testing mass, we made length and angle control variables, and varied the mass.  we found that the mass of the pendulum bob did not have any effect on period of the pendulum.  as shown in graphs/tables 3 and 4, the data set seems to have no correlation or proportionality to pendulum period.  in graph 4, error bars are included further bolstering our claim that mass has no effect on period.

	during the testing of angle of release, we made the length and mass control variables, and subsequently varied the angle.  we found through our testing that angle of release did not have any effect on period of pendulum provided the angle was kept to a small value to minimize air resistance.  as shown in graphs/tables 1 and 2, the period of pendulum does not change significantly enough to prove angle influences it.  in graph 2, error bars are depicted further supporting our claim.

	the testing of length vs. period was extremely fruitful compared to the other variables.  once again, we varied length and kept the other two variables as controls.  during our testing, we determined that length has a significant and exclusive effect on period of a pendulum.  looking at graphs/tables 5 and 6 as well as the data taken from the photogate, we can clearly conclude that varying the length of string attached to the pendulum bob is directly proportional to period of a pendulum.  error bars are depicted on graph 6 as well as the photogate graph, and they prove that length influences period even further.

	while experimenting, error is usually unavoidable to a certain extent.  when doing initial trials (without the photogate) we used a stopwatch to time the period of the pendulum.  this method is subject to quite a bit of random error since the human eye is not apt to determining when the period of a pendulum ends exactly, making it extremely difficult to time a period precisely.  this error could be reduced by using a photogate like in experiment 3, or some other sensor.  another source of random error was the air current in the room not being consistent 100% of the time, influencing the pendulum in unpredictable ways.  this error could be reduced by preforming the experiments in a room without air conditioning or other forms of air flow.  there was no systemic error in these experiments.

	the theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum is $t =(\frac{l}{g})^{0.5}$ with t being period, l being length of string, and g being the acceleration due to gravity.  this theoretical model supports our claim that length is the sole factor when dealing with period because there are not any other variables in the equation.  also, it is shown that l is in the numerator of the equation, meaning as it increases, so does period, this further supports our claim.

the constraints for these experiments were to only test 3 variables, and to keep the angle of release relatively small.  limiting us to 3 variables affects the generalizability of our results in that there were several other variables we could have tested to make sure length is the only variable affecting period.  keeping the angle of release relatively small is to limit the unpredictability of the pendulum and reduce air resistance.  this limitation affects the generalizability of our experiments in that we were not able to obtain data from large angles, giving us a smaller range of data to work with.
