discussion and conclusion:

	the purpose of this lab was to create mathematical models to describe the behavior of a real system and to understand what the variables and numerical values of these models represent. to determine the mathematical models three experiments were conducted. first, the hanging mass and acceleration of the cart were compared. different hanging masses were chosen, and the resultant accelerations were calculated (see graph 1 and table 1). the mathematical model found during this experiment  $a=0.0287 m - 0.029$. this model was found from the graph of the hanging masses vs the acceleration. the 0.287 is the acceleration and the -0.029 is the loss from friction. when the model is calculated you get the resultant acceleration of the system. the second experiment compared the mass on the cart with the acceleration of the system. the resulting mathematical model was $a=m^2 9e^{-07} – 0.0019 m + 1.159$. the third experiment done was to compare the friction on the system to the total acceleration of the system. sticks were attached to the cart in order to increase friction and the resultant accelerations were found. three different trendlines were found for the three lines on graph 3. the models for these trendlines are $a = 0.0316 m – 0.0765$, $a = 0.0264 m – 0.0041$, and $a = 0.0226 m – 0.0297$ in order from top to bottom. these models show that as the friction force increased, the acceleration decreased. the numerical values multiplied by mass in these models decreases as more friction was added to the cart proving this. a picture of another groups (group 1) work is pasted below. looking at the data, it shows that our results are indeed correct. in their data, the numerical value multiplied by mass decreases as the friction increases. this shows that our interpretation of these values was correct and gives more data to support that. during the conducted experiments, some error may have been present. when timing the system, the timer could have started or stopped a second late or a second early producing some random error in this experiment. in order to decrease this error, the releaser would count down from 3 for the timer to be more exact. another piece of the lab that could be improved upon was the way in which friction was added. there was no calculated number for the amount of friction added and in calculating this it would improve our results to include more accurate measurements. this also limited the generalizability of our results. to increase friction, four sticks with magnets were attached (two different sizes of sticks) to the cart. if more sticks with different levels of friction had been added, then the data would cover more range and show better results. our mathematical models show consistency with newtons 2nd law, $f = m a$. the first model, $a=m 0.0287-0.029$ shows that the mass and acceleration are correlated as in newtons 2nd law. these models also show that the force on a system is dependent on the mass and acceleration of that system which is the entirety of newtons 2nd law.
