discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab is to investigate the impact of applied force on the acceleration of a cart. the experimental mathematical model made was  $a=4.8734 f + 0.0198$. the model is linear, with an r^2 of 0.9986, so force and acceleration have a direct relationship. the resulting line in figure 1 shows a linear, positive slope of $m=4.8734$ so acceleration increases directly as applied force increases. the uncertainty multiplied by 2 was used for the error bars, since it would give a 68% confidence for the equivalency criterion. the error bars were too small to be seen, meaning that the true values very likely fell into the trend line. this supports the relationship previously discussed.

	the findings of two other groups support the claim. the data set for group 1 and group 2 were similar in values to the data set. for group 1, the experimental model was $a=4.8214 f + 0.002$. for group 2, the experimental model was $a=4.9681 f + 0.0076$. these models were both similar to the group model $a=4.8734 f + 0.0198$. both other models showed a linear relationship with a positive slope, supporting the claim that acceleration increases directly with applied force.
the experimental mathematical model made was  $a=4.8734 f + 0.0198$. this compared to the theoretical model $a = \frac{f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}}{m}$. the differences are due to forces present in the experimental context, such as air resistance to the cart’s movement, friction from the pulley’s string moving, friction from the air track pushing on the cart, and uncertainty of the air track program measurements. the mass of the system shows up in the (1/ total m) * f hanging, which would be the 4.8734f. this means that the mass of the system is (1/ 4.8734) which is 0.2052 kg. this is close to the total mass of the system measured as 0.1696 kg. the total mass also shows up in  $\frac{f_{unknown}}{m}= 0.0198$. a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass would cause the acceleration to not be uniform. this is because while the string lowered, more string mass would be attached to the hanging mass, changing the hanging mass and in turn the acceleration every time. 
potential systematic errors include an improperly calibrated balance or an improperly calibrated air track sensor. these can only be reduced by obtaining new equipment or calibrating the equipment. potential random errors include reading the balance inaccurately, which could be reduced by improving techniques. 
constraints in the experiment that limit the generalizability would friction on the moving object, since most objects will not be on an air track. if the hanging mass was larger, a stronger string would be needed, which would most likely have appreciable mass. this would make the acceleration not uniform. the friction of the string moving along the pulley also limits the results.
