our results show the effects of weight of the pendulum, angle of release, and length of the string on the swing time of a pendulum. our experiment with weight of the pendulum showed that the weight does not affect the swing time of the pendulum. the error bars overlap and therefore does not show significant change in our results as we adjusted the weight (fig. 1). our experiment with angle of release of the pendulum showed that the angle of release does not affect the swing time of the pendulum. the error bars overlap and therefore does not show significant change in our results as we adjusted the angle (fig. 2). our experiment with the length of the string did show significant change in our results as we adjusted the length. our first experiment did not show this as our error bars overlapped (fig. 3). this is due to low dispersion of our data and high amount of random error. however, our second experiment using photogate and a higher number of data points improved both; photogate has a much lower random error than a stopwatch and we tested for more points than before. this gave significant results that as length of the string increased the time of the swing increased. our equation of $y=0.0242 x - 0.0001 x² + 0.6456$ (rsquared is 0.99826), shows the rate at which the pendulum swing is affected (fig. 4). 

the experiment was constrained by the number of swing averages acquired due to time constraints. the length of the pendulum was also short due to the small size of the pendulum stand. a larger number of period averages would’ve given a more accurate trendline since as dispersion of data increases, accuracy of models increases. a larger pendulum stand would’ve also given a more accurate trendline as the points tested would also have higher dispersion.
