discussion and conclusion

for this experiment we were able to determine the factors that impact the period of a pendulum. from the results we can determine that both mass and angle show no relationship with the period of a pendulum. both graphs 2 and 3, show a max variation in the period of a pendulum that ranges from 0 – 0.07 seconds in graph 2, and 0 – 0.01 seconds in graph 3. these variations in relation to graph 1 show little to no change. graph 1 clearly displays an increase in the period of a pendulum as the string length increases. the trendline shows an r value very close to 1, which illustrates a strong positive correlation. during this experiment, a few random and systematic errors occurred. one in particular to address would be the issue of timing, by hand timing each trial for both angle and mass the operator introduces random error to the experiment. to reduce this random error, future experiments should be conducted using a photogate to ensure more accurate readings similar to the length trials. a possible systematic error could result from the timing tolerance of the photogate. all though small, this factor can still affect results. to conclude, length is the only factor that clearly effects the period of a pendulum, both mass and angle do not.
