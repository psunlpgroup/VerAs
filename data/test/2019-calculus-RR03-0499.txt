conclusion

testing what variables affect a pendulum has many parts. finding what the dependent variable will be for each test, then making sure the other variables are unchanged so there are no other influences. after going through multiple tests for each variable, the more the better, graphs were made from the gathered data to show exactly how the pendulum was effected. to make sure the data was correct, another test was done for one of the variables with a photogate so more accurate time periods could be made.

after officially gathering all the data needed, models could be made. $t=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{g}}$ l^2 is the theoretical equation. ours was $y=1.9997x^{0.5521}$ with an r squared value of 0.9994. our model showed that most of our predictions were correct. what we predicted for length and mass were correct, while the angle was a bit different. our model was compared to two other models from different groups to give a better result. when comparing all three models, it was concluded that they all pretty much gathered the same information. it also showed that the research question of what variables impact a pendulum could be answered by saying the length of the string impacts a pendulum, the mass does not, and if the angle is 20 degrees or lower, it also will not make an impact. however, when using stopwatches to test if the angle made an impact, out graph shows that it did even at angles less than 20 degrees. we narrowed this down to human error, as it seemed throughout the experiment the timekeepers were getting more and more anxious with the stopwatches. it could have also been the mere fact that we thought it would make a difference, so when testing it, the timekeepers would speed up a little without realizing it.

many errors could have occurred throughout these labs. human reaction time was one of the biggest errors we found. when first testing the variables, there were three people using stopwatches to find the period. we found this could end with varying results which could have a major impact on the overall data. other human error we found made an impact was the person dropping the pendulum. this person may not always drop it the same way or count down with the same speed. 

constraints that were not taken into account with this lab were air resistance and the added weight of the string. although neither of these would have quite a huge impact, they could still stray the results.
