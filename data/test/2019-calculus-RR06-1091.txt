discussion and conclusion

the purpose of these labs was to develop multiple mathematical models which explains the functions a real, system that is affected by changes of mass and force applied that can be applied to multiple scenarios, as well as to creating a better understanding of force applied, mass of the system, and the angle of inclination 
experiment 1 resulted in the mathematical model of $a = 2.6479 f + 0.0118$. the physical meaning for the constants in the experimental model is constant gravitational acceleration and other control variables. experiment 2 resulted in the mathematical model of $a = 0.3434 m-0.933$ the physical meaning for the constants in the experimental model is constant gravitational acceleration and other control variables. the results from experiment 3 created the mathematical models that are shown in figures 3 and 4. the physical meaning for the constants in the experimental model is constant gravitational acceleration and other control variables
group 3’s claims support the findings of our group. group 3 increases the confidence and reinforces our claims of the physical meaning for the constants in our experimental model.

possible errors (random and/or systematic) might have been if the pully did move at the same tangential velocity as the rope as the hanging mass fell. this would be due to not enough friction presented and could be solved if there was more applied force. also, there may be an error in assuming the surface is perfectly frictionless, and to solve for that error we may have to do more research to find the acceleration in an ideal system vs. our setup.
the main constraint in this lab setup that may limit the generalizability of the results is the specialized equipment provided (i.e. the frictionless track and the program that we used).  
our two experimental mathematical models are consistent with newton’s second law because it is approximately consistent with $f = m a$
