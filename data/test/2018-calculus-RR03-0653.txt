this first set of labs was designed as to find what effects or impacts the period of a pendulum. the first lab (lab 01) served to identify which variables (mass, angle of release, length of string) impacted the period. for this lab group, the first lab consisted of only testing the mass and the angle of release and not the length of the string due to time constraints. the mass was found to not impact the period because with the error bars expanded to twice their value on the graph (which is the standard for this class), all of the values of the period on graph 1.1 fell within their ranges while having a slope of approximately zero. this meant that one could not reasonably conclude that the mass impacted the period. for the same reasons, the angle of release graph 2.1 was also found to not impact the period of the pendulum because with the expanded error bars, there was significant overlap and it is impossible (with the data collected) to know if there was any difference between the values for the period. 

using the process of elimination, the length of string was the only variable that could impact the period of the pendulum. this was later tested in lab 03 and was verified as the variable that impacts the length of the period by looking at the data gathered in lab 03 on graph 3.1 and seeing that the result of the different lengths is significantly different from each other. while there may be some overlap between neighboring points when the error bars are extended and doubled, there is a trend throughout the graph that shows that there is a significant difference between the period at different lengths of string.

	the theoretical mathematical formula of the period of the pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ (the physics classroom, 2018) where t is the time of the period, l is the length of the string, and g is the force of gravity, or 9.8(m/s/s). the data gathered in lab 03 fits this model very closely when g is substituted and the data is plotted with a power trendline on graph 3.1, with the equation of the trendline being $y=0.193 x^{0.5068}$ with the y is the time of the period and x is the length of the string. in light of the theoretical model, it is understandable for why there was no relation between the mass of the pendulum and also the angle of release as they are not present in the equation whatsoever.

	throughout this set of labs were errors, including random and systematic. the stopwatch used to measure the time for the first two labs introduced random error via human input and may be responsible for the variation in times because the theoretical model doesnâ€™t have them impact the period at all. this error was attempted to be reduced by taking the time for 10 periods and averaging them to find a more accurate value, but the random error still persists. as a result, there must be error bars on the graphs to show just how much random variation there may be between the recorded value and the true value. systematic error may have been introduced in a variety of different ways, ranging from the angle of release, the length of the string, and also the mass of the pendulum itself. however, these systematic errors should have been constant throughout the experiment and should only impact the accuracy of the data gathered and not the precision. 

if this data is generalized, there are constraints that must be put in place to ensure the accuracy of any other results. some of these constraints include but are not limited to is  no external forces (excluding gravity) are interacting with the system and the length of the string must be constant.
