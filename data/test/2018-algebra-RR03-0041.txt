discussion and conclusion

	

over the course of the past three weeks, the period of the pendulum and variables can impact it have been observed and tested. three independent variables were studied. they are as follows is  mass, angle of release, and length of string. 

the first variable tested was the mass of the pendulum bob. this mass was manipulated by adding/removing metal weights to the bob and was measured using a balance. after reviewing the data collected, we found that there was no significant relationship between mass of the bob and the length of the period. the range of the data had a value of .4 seconds. this could have been caused by sources of random error, such as the reaction time. as well as, systematic error, such as the balance was calibrated incorrectly measuring the masses all greater or all less than their actual value. graph 1 appeared to show a negative linear relationship, but after examining the theoretical period formula, as well as identifying an overlap in the error bars, we concluded that there was no relationship between these two variables. 

the second variable studied was angle of release. the angle of release was manipulated by manually pulling back the string further away from its starting point at 0 degrees. this variable was measured by using a protractor. due to time constraints, pre-collected data was used. after examining the data in graph 3, there was very little deviation in the data. the range of the data was .01 seconds. when using small angles, all of the error bars on the graph overlapped, indicating that there is no relationship between angle of release and period. however, if we had more time available to test greater angles, we most likely would have seen a relationship between the two variables due to factors like air resistance.

the last variable studied was length of string. this was manipulated by adjusting the length by loosening bolts, pulling the string down then tightening bolts on the pendulum. our first three trials were completed using a stopwatch. the prior five trials were completed using the photogate to keep time. at first, we saw a positive linear relationship between length vs period. as we increased the length of the string, the period of the pendulum increased. further investigating this variable, the photogate was used to collect data more accurately and efficiently. after analyzing the photogate data and using a line of best fit, we were able to conclude that there is an exponential relationship between these variables. the error bars on graph 4 were spaced out and had a very small value of .001 seconds. 

after experimentation, results of the length of string vs. period were compared to a mathematical model for period. this equation is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. our model derived from graph 4 was $y=2.0099 x^{0.5022}$, this indicates that we took good data points and accurate measurements. when rearranging the equation, l is to the Â½ power, which is very close to our power of .5022.  our coefficient was 2.01, which was the same as theoretical value of $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ so  2.01 when the equation is rearranged. the line of best fit for this exponential relationship successfully matched up with our data points.

several random errors were present in this experiment such as reaction time when using the stopwatch (with the exception of the photogate trials), faulty use of the protractor when testing angle of release, errors made when measuring the length of the string. possible systematic errors present could be is  balance not calibrated correctly and frayed or damaged string. ways to improve our experiment include is  repeating more trials, using the photogate to measure time, using an electric balance and using an automatic device that measures the angle of release. these solutions would allow for more accurate, precise and efficient data collection.
