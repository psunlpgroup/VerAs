discussion and conclusion

the research question being investigated during this experiment was to see how the acceleration of the system changes when the hanging mass of the system changes. the research question was addressed by changing the hanging mass of the system (iv) and testing how the acceleration of the system (iv) was affected by this. the control variable in this experiment was the total mass of the system, which was 0.18886 kg and the uncertainty was ±0.00005 kg. the hypothesis was that the acceleration of the system is related to the hanging mass on the system. in other words, the prediction was that the force (n) due to hanging mass increases the acceleration (m/s^2) in a linear manner. the data collected showed that our hypothesis was supported as the hanging mass did lead to an increase in the acceleration in a linear manner. the equation $y=5.1023 x - 0.02$ from figure 1.1 shows that there is a positive linear relationship between hanging mass and acceleration. for the “x” value in this equation, you plug in the value for applied force (in newtons) which can be calculated by doing  (hanging mass* 9.8m/s^2)/(1000), and that will give you the acceleration of the system . the higher the value for hanging mass, the bigger the applied force value is, and therefore the greater the acceleration of the system. 
group 1 has the same hypothesis as our group and their findings through the experimental equation prove this. group 1 had smaller values for their experimental equation than those of ours. this is because their c1 value is just the hanging mass in grams, whereas ours is the force applied which is determined using the equation (hanging mass*9.8)/ (1000).  this group’s experimental mathematical model was still a positive linear relationship just like ours and therefore their data supported the claim of ours. 

group 3g1b had a hypothesis that the acceleration affects the force of the hanging mass. this to me seems like an error made by them as the research question was to see if the hanging mass affects the acceleration. this group’s data did supports our data. this can be said as this group also had a positive linear mathematical relationship, as did ours. their c1 value was 4.6961 whereas ours was 5.1023 and their c2 value was -0.0842 whereas ours was -0.0202. the differences in these values is due to us having a different system mass. 

the mathematical model found in the experiment, $y=c1 x+c2$, when c2 is 0 it relates to the theoretical equation $a= \frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ . the force for the theoretical equation is (hanging mass*9.8m/s^2)/(1000) which is 0.04753 n for trial 1 and the mass of the system is 0.18886 kg. to find the theoretical acceleration value you do $a= 0.04753 0.18886= 0.252$. this is different from our experimental acceleration value for trial 1 as that was 0.210. the experimental acceleration value differed from the theoretical acceleration value by 0.042 m/s^2 when only one force is accounted for. forces that are present other the hanging weight may be the force of friction. this shows up in the enhanced theoretical equation where force of friction is shown. the theoretical equation is $y=\frac{f_{applied} + f_{friction}}{m_{sys}}$. the experimental equation is $y=5.1023 x - 0.02$ ($y=c1 x+c2$). c1  is 1/msys , which when numbers are plugged in would be 1/0.1886 kg is 5.2949. our theoretical c1 value is 0.1926 greater than our experimental c1. we had to calculate the force external (force of friction) based on our c2 value. the equation used to calculate force external was $f_{ext}=c2 m_{sys}$ , $f_{ext}=-0.0202 0.18886 = -3.8 10^{-3n}$. the negative sign on this just means that the force of friction was acting in the opposite direction in which the system was moving in. if a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the car were used, then the acceleration would increase. i say this because in our results now, we saw a positive linear relationship between hanging mass and acceleration where if the hanging mass increased, so did our acceleration. so, if a non-massless string were used it would add on to the weight of the hanging mass, causing an increase in the acceleration. the rate of acceleration may differ depending on how much of the total mass of the system changes, but it will still increase. 

in this lab, a possible random error that could have occurred is that the bobbers or the system could have been measured inaccurately because the spring scale used was not digital this could lead to an inaccurate reading of mass, which would lead to inaccurate data. systematic errors could have been from using an old scale that is worn out, resulting in the weights on the scale to be an inaccurate mass. this would also lead to weighing the mass of system inaccurately which then would lead to inaccurate data. also, the data studio could not be calibrated properly resulting in incorrect velocity values. the random error was reduced by weighing each hanging mass while moving bobbers from the cart to the hanging end of the string. the systematic errors could be solved by both having new equipment and making sure the data studio has recently and correctly been calibrated. 

	 constraints on this lab were not having enough time to do more trials to further reduce any error. additionally, the lab was limited by the supplies given to us in order to weigh the system (bobbers, and paperclips).  therefore, the results of the lab would be generalized due to the number of bobbers we were able to use making all the system masses similar. another constraint was the equipment. with better equipment available, more accurate results may be obtained to get an

experimental value which had a percent error significantly less than the theoretical model. if the

experiment was reproduced without any of these constraints a more accurate experiment may be conducted
