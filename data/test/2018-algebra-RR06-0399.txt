discussion and conclusion

in labs 5-6, the research question was “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?” the independent variable was the applied force (n) due to hanging mass. when altering the applied force, the acceleration of the system also changed. more specifically, when the applied force was increased, the acceleration also increased. in figure 1, a positive, linear relationship is shown between applied force and acceleration of a system, supporting our prediction. the resulting mathematical model, $a=4.2224 f + 0.0358$ found from figure 1 makes sense because when you plug an applied force value into ‘f’ of the model, the ‘a’ value changes in a linear fashion. when comparing our mathematical model to two other groups’ models (found in pdf attachments), the models only varied slightly from ours, which could be attributed to systematic errors that will be discussed later. when comparing the data of the other two groups to our data, the relationships between applied force and acceleration of a system were the same as ours, a positive linear relationship, which supports our claim that as applied force increases, so does the acceleration of a system. when comparing the experimental and theoretical models, our model had a slope of 4.2224, whereas the slope of the theoretical model found from (1/m system), was 5.276. these values do not vary greatly, and both yield the same relationship, but the difference could be attributed to the constraint i will discuss later. another force other than the hanging weight that may be present is the force of friction between the pulley and the string. we concluded that this force would have affected the velocities of the cart recorded by the track, resulting in the slopes (acceleration of the system) being inaccurate, which in turn creates an inaccurate mathematical model. the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model in the ‘f’ variable, which is the applied force due to the hanging mass, which is equal to (hanging mass)(gravity), where hanging mass is 15.964 g and gravity is equal to 9.8 m/s^2. if a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart was used, the acceleration would still be uniform because the mass of the string would remain consistent throughout the experiment. the mass of the string would just have to be accounted for in the beginning of the experiment when measuring the mass of the system. some errors that could have been present in this experiment were friction between the string and the pulley, which is a systematic error. a way to reduce this error would be to ensure that the string used has no knots or frays before conducting the experiment. another possible source of error is the software used to record the velocities of the cart could have been uncalibrated, which is also a systematic error. a way to reduce this error is to ensure that the software is calibrated before conducting the experiment. a source of random error could perhaps be an unintended additional push force from the person releasing the cart. a way to reduce this error would be to ensure that you are gently and carefully releasing the cart when it is time to record the measurements, rather than giving it a push. i feel like the only constraint that may limit the generalizability of our results is the assumption we made that all of the bobs weighed 5.35 g, when their masses might have actually varied.
