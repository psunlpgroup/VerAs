discussion and conclusion



for the introduction to pendulum experimental design, the objective was to determine if the independent variables of length of string, angle of swing, and mass of pendulum had an effect on the dependent variable of length of period. looking at the graph for angle of swing vs. period of pendulum, while there was a linear relationship visible, with the error bars included, there was a large overlap meaning the data was not statistically significant to show a relationship between the two factors. this is the same for the relationship between mass of pendulum and length of period. the data points showed no correlation and the error bars had complete overlap. for the first run with length of string, the graph displayed a linear relationship between length of string and period of pendulum with very small error bars. this then led to a confirmation that the longer the length of the pendulum, the longer the period of the pendulum.

a second trial was run to confirm these results using a mathematical model. using the theoretical mathematical equation of $y=0.10035 x$ data was collected and graphed to show an actual equation of $y=0.12020008 x$. there was not a linear relationship like assumed, but a power relationship between the two variables. from the actual equation, there is only a slight discrepancy between the values compared to the theoretical equation, meaning that there is a relationship between length of string and period of the pendulum. 

possible errors throughout the experiment could be attributed to random error in measuring angle of swing, length of string, and timing the period of the pendulum. these errors could be minimized by ensuring the person measuring/recording data is doing so with consistence and caution. systematic errors throughout the experiment could be attributed to the tools and programs used to take measurements and collect data. these errors could be minimized by ensuring all tools and programs are set up correctly and working properly. constraints within the experiment include accuracy in measurement, precision of tools, and time. with more consistency in measuring, precision in all of the tools and programs used, and more time to run more trials, there could be more clarity and less deviance in the mathematical model found.
