discussion & conclusion: angle

when testing what factors would affect the rotation time of the pendulum, we found that the angle at which the pendulum started at had a parabolic relationship with time after conducting 3 trials for each angle measured (figure 1). initially with smaller angles (between 10 to 30 degrees) the pendulum would have a faster time of completing one rotation, but with increasing angles afterwards (between 35 to 60 degrees) the pendulum took a longer time to complete one rotation. the peak angle and time was 30 degrees that resulted in one rotation taking 2.28 seconds. after the angle of 30 degrees the times went down to 2.1 seconds and 2.05 seconds at 40 degrees and 60 degrees respectively (figure 4). 

in conclusion, due to these results we fail to reject our hypothesis, but reject our prediction because even though there was an effect on the time of the rotation, the increase in the angle did not result in a direct increase in time of rotation. this could have been due to random error, which includes measuring the angle out correctly or releasing the pendulum at the same time the stopwatch was started and ending the stopwatch exactly after one rotation. and due to systematic error of the protractor not having the proper scaling when it was made.

discussion & conclusion is  weight 

	when testing what factors would affect the rotation time of the pendulum, we found that the weight of the pendulum itself had a slightly parabolic relationship with time after conducting 3 trials for each weight measured (figure 2). between the weight of 50 grams to the weight of 250 grams the time it took for one rotation to be completed by the pendulum increased gradually, but overall the times stayed relatively close to one another to the point the graph showed almost a horizontal line at $y=1$figure 5). 

in conclusion, due to these results we reject our hypothesis and reject our prediction because there was no significant change in the time one rotation took with the increase in weight of the pendulum. this could have been a result of systematic error due to not knowing the exact weight that was applied to the pendulum since each new weight block wasn’t weighed out and we just depended on the weight’s label as the actual weight of the block. along with random error, which includes measuring the angle out correctly at 20 degrees or releasing the pendulum at the same time the stopwatch was started and ending the stopwatch exactly after one rotation.

discussion & conclusion is  length 

	when testing what factors would affect the rotation time of the pendulum, we found that the length of the string at which the pendulum was attached to had a very linear relationship after conducting 3 trials for each length measured (figure 3). as the length of the string grew from 0.05 meters to 1.8 meters the time it took for one rotation to be completed increased at a slope of 1.12 seconds/meter in the initial stages of this lab (figure 6). but after taking this linear relationship and redoing the data for the length of string in a more precise and accurate form the data collected again resulted in an exponential relationship that still showed the time of one rotation increasing at the length of the string increased with an exponential slope of 2.093x to the power of 0.36 which is very close to the theoretical expectation (figure 7). 

	in conclusion, due to these results we fail to reject our hypothesis because the length of the string did effect the time it took for 1 rotation to be completed. we also fail to reject our prediction because the relationship between time and length of string did increase together in a direct manner. but even though we fail to reject both the hypothesis and the prediction, there are still instances where standard and random error did occur. when doing the experiment by hand there were many cases of random error like measuring the angle out correctly at 20 degrees or releasing the pendulum at the same time the stopwatch was started and ending the stopwatch exactly after one rotation. there was standard error from believing that the measuring tape used for the length of the string perfectly correct and long with believing that the photogate was accurate in its time of the rotations even though our data the second time around with the photogate was more precise.
