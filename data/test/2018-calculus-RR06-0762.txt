The purpose of this lab was to determine the relationship between acceleration and force on a system with a consistent mass. This experiment was accomplished with the setup pictured below.
To change the force applied without changing the mass, we gradually transferred the bobbers from the gold cart to the end of the string. This way the mass of the system stayed the same, but the force gradually increased. The data for this experiment is enumerated in Table 1. The data was graphed (Figure 1) to visualize the relationship between the acceleration and force. We determined that the relationship was linear with an equation of . This linear relationship is consistent with our prediction (in Experimental Design Template). The other groups findings are pictured below.


Both groups determined that the relationship between acceleration and force is linear, supporting our prediction and result. Their extrapolated equations were similar to ours as well.
The theoretical model for acceleration vs force is , so  is the slope of the line (in Figure 1). Using our mass the exact slope would be 5.9210 and there would be no y-intercept. An enhanced theoretical equation is , where m is the mass of the system. This equation explains the discrepancy between our experimental equation and the theoretical model Â­ . The external force can be attributed to the friction forces acting on the system, such as the friction of the pulley in front of the motion sensor, and air resistance. This causes a difference in the equation. 
There were some errors that were identified during this experiment. The error in the motion sensor is the only systematic error, which could have shifted our data and altered our equation. The random errors were the friction of the pulley, and the calibration of the motion sensor. Using the high-low method, we calculated our uncertainty for each trial, listed in Table 1. We calculated our overall error to be 8.95%. Using a frictionless pulley would reduce the error in this experiment.
