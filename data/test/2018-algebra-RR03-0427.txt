discussion:

the research question for all of the experiments of this lab was what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? to test this research question in regards to mass, the group conducted an experiment by keeping the same length of the string and the same angle at which the bob was released and only changed the mass of the bob to see if mass had a significant effect on the period or not. after conducting this experiment with five trials, it was concluded that the mass of the bob does not have a significant enough effect on the period. this was determined by creating a scatter plot and creating error bars and using the .01841s of uncertainty. the error bars on figure 2 above show that mass does not have a significant effect on the period because the error bars are overlapping. to test this research question for the angle vs. time, another experiment was conducted in lab 1 by keeping the same mass and length of the string and only changing the angle at which the bob was released for a total of three trials. after conducting this experiment, based on the data and error bars in figure 1, the angle would have a significant effect on the period though later informed that the angle would actually not have an effect. we thought that it would have a significant effect because the error bars are spread out and do not overlap, in fact they are very small. this could be due to random or systematic errors. the error bars were used with an uncertainty of .0841s. to test the research question for the length of the string vs. time, another experiment was conducted by keeping the angle and the mass of the bob the same and changing the length of the string for six trials. after creating the graph for this experiment (figure 3), it was determined that the length of the string was significant for the period of the pendulum. this was determined because of the error bars that are there but you cannot see them on the graph because they are so small and since they are not overlapping, the length of the string is significant when testing what impacts the period of a pendulum. the experiment conducted in lab 3 which also tested length vs. time of the period for six trials showed that the length of the string is significant. this was determined by looking at figure 4 above and seeing that the error bars are too small to be seen which indicates that the data is significant for using an uncertainty of .001s. the number of uncertainty was .001s because the error of the photogate was very small. after all of these experiments, in lab 2 we then estimated the range of uncertainty by doing ten trials of the mass, angle, and length all the same. we then were able to obtain the standard deviation of this data to be .0841s and used this for our error bars in each of the figures except figure 4. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$.  when you substitute g for its actual value (981cm/s2), you get $t=0.2006 l^{1.2}$.  this means that the theoretical value of c1 is 0.2005 and the value of c2 is 0.5.  we can compare these theoretical values to values we obtained experimentally using the equation of the line of best fit.  
this is relatively similar to the value of .2006 and .5 so they can support the theoretical math model.
there was curve fitting in figure 3 from lab 1. 
this shows that the experimental c1 value of .2589 is relatively similar to that of the theoretical equation of .2006.  our experimental value of c2 is .4527 which is relatively like that of the theoretical equation value of .5.  this shows that our data has a relatively close experimental mathematical dependence to the theoretical mathematical model.  
there was also curve fitting in figure 4 from lab 3. 
mass is not a part of the theoretical equation, so it does not matter when looking that the timing of pendulum oscillations. 
the data above in figure 2 also shows that the mass vs. time relationship is not significant because of the overlap of the error bars. 
there was no curve fitting for mass which also is indicative of its insignificance. 
angle is not a part of the theoretical equation, so it does not matter when looking that the timing of pendulum oscillations. 
our data does have a relationship between angle vs time, but there are many things that could have caused this such as an error like lack of repetition (extra data to make data more accurate and precise). 
there was also no curve fitting in figure 1, just a linear line, which is also indicative of insignificance in the data. 
random errors would be not looking head on when measuring angle, delay start/stopping when using the stop watch when measuring the time of the oscillations, and also the person measuring the string could have over or underestimated the length of the string, skewing the data. each of these could be reduced by making sure to have your eyes level with the protractor when measuring the angle, doing multiple trials when timing the oscillations, and also taking a closer look at the tape measure and making sure you are estimating to the nearest hundredth and adding +/- .05 depending on the values of the tape measure. 
tape measure potentially being stretched from years of use. reducing this error would be to buy a brand-new tape measure and use that instead of something that potentially increase your error such as an old, stretched out tape measure.

constraints in this experiment that may limit the generalizability of our results would be that there is a lot of room for random error. this random error could be coming from a lot of human error such as the example of not looking head on at the protractor when measuring the angle.
