discussion and conclusion 

the primary goal of this experiment was to derive a mathematical model for the relationship between force and acceleration of the system. that is, how does the force applied to the system change its acceleration? 

in this experiment, we produced a mathematical model of $y=5.0872 x + 0.001$ where y is acceleration, x is force, and 5.0872 is 1/mass. this mathematical model and graph is shown in figure 1. the error bars in this graph is very small which is means that the model derived from this experiment had little error. this graph clearly shows a positive linear correlation which supports the prediction.  

one group had a mathematical model of $a=0.005 f - 0.0338$. this group left their mass in grams, while we put ours into kilograms. so, both slopes are very close to 5kg/n. the c2 values for both models are very small. this means that this groupâ€™s model supports our model of $a=5.0872 f + 0.0019$. another group had a mathematical model of $a=0.0053 f - 0.0306$. this group also left their mass in grams, so their slope is very close to ours and their c2 value is also very small. this means that this groups results also supports our findings. 

the theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. this model supports the experimental mathematical model of $a=5.0872 f + 0.0019$ because our slope represents 1/m and because the c2 value of 0.0019 is extremely small. the data points on figure 1 deviate little from the line of best fit. this means that this line probably has a very high r-squared value which shows that the slope is an accurate numerical description of the mass and the relationship between force and acceleration. 

an enhanced theoretical model for the acceleration of the system is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. this model supports the experimental mathematical model because the fext/msys represents the c2 value of 0.0019. this c2 value can be explained by the force of friction from the air track and air resistance. the value is shown in figure 1 as the y-intercept. if friction and air resistance were absent, this mathematical model would lack a y-intercept value and would resemble the theoretical model of $f=m a$ much closer.  

if the string of the system was very heavy, the mass of the lower system, and therefore the force, would increase as the cart moved along the track. because of this the acceleration would increase as the cart moved and would not be constant. 

random error could have occurred during the measurement of each bobber. the uncertainty of the mass was 0.005g, so in each measurement we had to approximate the thousandth place of mass which could have led to random error. this could have been reduced by taking numerous measurements of each bobber or by using more accurate scales. another source of random error could have been due to the exact distance that the cart was released at. this means that there could have been small differences in the travel distance of the cart for each trial based on the uncertainty of the measurement on the track. to reduce this error, the same person lined up the cart for each trial. 

constraints of this experiment were the length of the air track, the external forces from friction and air resistance and the changing mass of the lower system. the air track was relatively short which means that each trail was very quick. because of the small time frame for each trial, any small error could have greatly impacted the final acceleration reading. also, because the air track could not guarantee lack of friction, there were external forces of friction. since the experiment was not conducted in a vacuum, there was an external force from air resistance. both forces showed up in the final mathematical model. the changing mass of the lower system had to be done in certain increments from which we could not deviate since we had to change the mass by one bobber for each trail. this constraint also meant that we were unable to measure very small forces. since there were only so many bobbers, we also could not measure the impact of very large forces on the acceleration of the system.
