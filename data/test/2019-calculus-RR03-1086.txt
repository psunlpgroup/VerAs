conclusion:

the goal of the experiment was to find the relationship of the period of a pendulum to the length of a string and angle of release. the independent variables being the length of the string, the weight of the pendulum, and the angle the pendulum was released at. the dependent variable was time. this experiment was conducted on february 3 2019. 

the data from table 1 helps prove that with an increase of angle of release, the period of the pendulum will increase. this is because when the angle is increased, the pendulum has to travel further to reach the same angle on the other half of the swing. graph 1 also helps prove this by having a positive slope, time increasing as angle increases. the data is justified because the confidence levels are very low, and our error bars are low enough to not be seen. these certainty values were calculated by taking several measurements and using precise equipment. to get the length certainty values low, we tool several measurements. this would only leave systematic error to have our calculations off. the only random errors that would be encountered would be through timing the pendulum and the slight adjustments made when measuring the angle of release. the major restraints of the experiment were how precise our measurements could get. with more precise equipment, the confidence levels can be even higher. this would help eliminate systematic error leaving random error to affect the results. for example, using a camera to mark the peak times of the period. and using that, the time could be recorded at 1/60th of a second or even more precise. a background can be applied to find the exact angle. this can also be tracked using image processing. 

to summarize, there is a positive correlation to period with changing the angle of release and length of the pendulum. this can be observed by plotting an equation from both graphs. 3e-05x^2 â€“ 0.001x + 1.3048 for graph 1 and 0.3165x^0.4048 for graph 2. as angle and length increases, the period of the pendulum will also increase.
