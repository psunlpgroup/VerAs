conclusion:
Our research question was, what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? Our experiment reflected the question because we tested different lengths of the string to see how it affected the time. All other variables remained constant. As a result of the experiment, we found that as we increased the length of the string that led to the pendulum, the time it took to complete its swinging cycle also increased. Our graphs clearly show this, by the slope of the line showing a correlation to the increase in time. Some other variables we tested were the weight of the pendulum and the angle from which we dropped the pendulum. From this data we found that the standard deviation of the graphs intersected a lot.
	Systematic errors were present in our beginning tests because we were timing the pendulum swings by hand instead of using the automated machine. For our later testing, we were able to use the automated timing machine which eliminated this error. Another constraint we tested was the amount of weight added to the pendulum mass. Ultimately, we found that weight added to or subtracted from the pendulum does not affect the time period.
