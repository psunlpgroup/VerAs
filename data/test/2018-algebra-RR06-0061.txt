conclusion:
	Looking at the data it is shown that the relationship between applied force and acceleration to be a positive and linear. As the force (hanging weight) increases the acceleration of the system also increases. Even though the error bars are too small to see this can be used to show that there is a significant relationship. There is not over lap of the error bars and the R2 value is really close to 1. Comparing our data to other groups further proves our findings. Looking at pictures 1 and 2 you can initially tell that the equations are linear because they are the style of $y=m x+b$. This matching the data we collected. This can then be compared the theoretical model of $y=C1 F+C2$ or $a=\frac{f_{hang}}{m_{sys}}$. Plugging our first trials data into the experimental model gets us .28 while plugging it into the theoretical model gives us .26. These numbers are pretty close. The variability can be due to random or systematic errors. Some of these include there being an outside force of friction or air resistance. This would then turn the theoretical equation into $a=\frac{f_{hang}}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{friction}}{m_{sys}}$. Also, if the string was not massless then the hanging force would not have been constant. Thus, as more and more of the string went over the pully the force would keep increasing. The generalization of there being no friction and a massless string creates constraints for the experiment.  For Random errors my group personally noticed tape on one of the bobbers after the experiment making the Fhang not be consistent. This can easily be fixed in future trials by making sure all the bobbers weigh the same. Systematic errors such as the scale being off cannot be fixed by taking more measurements. Altogether, our findings support a positive linear relationship between force applied and acceleration of a system.
