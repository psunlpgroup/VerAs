conclusion:

what impacts the acceleration of a system? what model can be made from the experiment and how do the variables impact the numerical values of the model?
for example, the first experiment we did with the bobbers as the hanging weight we said the hanging mass is m1 and the mass of the car was m2. we did two trials then took a bobber from m1 and put it on m2 and then took another two trials and did the same thing until all the bobbers had been switched. this was done to test the research question of what impacts the acceleration of a system and a model was made from the collected data. this was represented in figure 1 and data table 1. the claim made based off the first experiment is the acceleration decreases as m1 decreases. the error bars are too small to see so they have minimal impact.
present (photo of the other groups’ whiteboard is fine) and discuss the findings of at least two other groups from work completed in lab 06.  discuss how the results of these groups contribute to your understanding of what the numerical values in your mathematical model(s) might represent. remember that these other sources of data must be cited properly; such as by group #.  

mass vs acceleration is  $a=2.9498 m - 0.0377$ cv is .339kg force tilt

force vs acceleration is  $a=0.0532 m^{-3.096}$	cv is .389n  inverse
group number two’s data supports our data very they got cv vales very similar to our the got cv is .339kg forve tilt which is the exact same as our and cv is .3822n inverse which is very similar to our value as you can see above the picture. therefore, the data strongly supports ours.
group number one’s data also supports our data pretty well. they got cv values similar to our as well cv is .33968kg force tilt and cv is .384n inverse. they also got a very similar linear model to us it is $a= 3.044 m-0.042$ which is very similar to our model and supports our data.
the theoretical model for the acceleration of a system by a single force is represented by the form $a = c1 f+c2$ and my mathematical experimental model $a=2.9498 m^{-0.0377}$ does support the theoretical model because it follows the same form as the theoretical model.
the theoretical model for the acceleration of a system by more than one force is represented by $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ and my mathematical experimental model is  $a=0.0532 m^{-3.096}$ does support the theoretical model because they contain the same form and the mathematical model was form using curve fitting using the power curve.
if a heavy string was connecting the hanging mass to the cart the acceleration would decrease because the equation for acceleration is $a = \frac{f}{m}$ so if m increases the acceleration will decrease.
some random errors that were found in this experiment were the different masses of the bobbers, all the bobbers were very similar, but some had different masses then other which i do not think was intentional. this might have just been because of the random error is the scale we were measuring them with because we were using an old balance rather than a new electrical balance that is more consistent and accurate. we realized the different masses of the bobbers after we had collected all our data and just assumed, they had the same mass. another possible random error was that the person who held the cart still while air flowed through the system might have let go too early causing friction with the track this would have slowed acceleration affecting the data. a systematic error could have been a knot that was in our string that connected our cart to our hanging mass. this is systematic because the knot would rub on the pulley the same for every trial causing the data to be shifted in one direction. the random errors could have been reduced by being more patient when releasing the cart and measuring the mass of each bobber and not making assumptions.
a constraint that might have limited the generalizability of our results could have been that we did not have enough time to take more trials that could have made our results more accurate and would have allowed us to generalize them more.
