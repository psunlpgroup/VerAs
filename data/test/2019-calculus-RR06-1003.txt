conclusion:

 the purpose of the lab was to develop a mathematical model that describe the behavior of an independent variable and acceleration. this relates to the research questions that were provided within the first and second table is  how does the acceleration of the system change when an “independent variable” changes? this was conducted as the purpose of lab 05. within lab 06, creating an understanding of each numerical value and variable included in the lab to determine how aspects of the physical lab setting contribute to the mathematical models was another purpose of the lab.

 the mathematical model, as part of lab 05, was determined by creating trendlines (linear in part 1 and power function in part 2). these trendlines were developed through the use of the data that was taken from the computer measure values as seen in data table 1 and data table 2. the x and y for the relative variables were then substituted into each necessary part. in the graph 1, the x variable was applied force and was the system’s mass in graph 2.  for the y variables, both graphs used acceleration. the simplest form of each test was then derived algebraically and compared to the theoretical model by turning control variables into coefficients. the acceleration is dependent on applied force (as applied force increases, acceleration increases, while other values that may affect the experiment are held constant) and mass of the system (as mass of the cart increases, the acceleration decreases, while other values are held constant).  so, the substituted values reflected these variables of the equation. during the findings of lab 06, we knew in data table 3 and graph 3, values were determined by sensors and computed data. the computed values with the sensors led to very accurate results, yielding error bars that were not visible. acceleration occupied the y axis as the dependent set of data found while force applied was set to the x value. the acceleration was dependent on the applied force which was affected by the tilt of the track depending on how large or small the angle of tilt was. as the tilt increased, the force applied increased, and therefore the acceleration increased. our mathematical model was determined from the forces acting on the hanging mass and through another algebraic process, the equation was found, and values were substituted in for respective variables.




as seen above in both photos of group 2 and 3’s whiteboards, there is not a large significant difference between the data found by our group and by our classmates. the group 3’s data differs in the sign of the c2 value (-). this is a result of the difference that occurred between the two experiments. this could be explained by the tilt of the track leading to a seemingly negative starting component. group 3 had very similar results to our data, including the added b part of the general linear equation. our data did not vary greatly from others work, and the data they provided fits the same formula used by our group to determine graph shape. this meant that the mathematical model that our group had created was a valid model for the hanging mass and acceleration. each equation was found through the same algebraic principles for the general mathematical model also demonstrating that the variables and factors used in our lab was conducted correctly and represents the real-world model accurately. 

 in this experiment, there are multiple variables that may impact the results of our data and the experiment. even though there is negligible friction, the air resistance can affect the acceleration of the system as systematic error that slows the cart. additionally, the track could have deficiencies in it where the air being pushed out is inconsistent so there could be slight dips on the air the cart rides on to create a frictionless system. the track may have a slope that could produce a systematic error, increasing or decreasing the acceleration of the cart. any issues in the string or how well the pulley rotates, such as knots, could have led to a random error that influenced our results as well. some improvements that could be made to the experiment would be to remove any elements of friction and air resistance entirely. including the possibility of doing the experiment inside of a vacuum. another possible improvement to the experiment could be changing the masses from the fishing bobs to something that fits the cart and string better. a smoother string could help reduce friction on the rolling pulley and remove any inconsistencies while it moves.

 the limiting constraint that could greatly affect this lab is the fact that there is air resistance and an imperfect pulley. the condition we were looking for was based off of a theoretical model which should be followed as closely as possible. this means meeting perfect ideal conditions which would make these labs especially difficult due to the possible factors that could interfere. there are also additional assumptions that are made that would mean our results do not account for other such minute changes or differences. the inclusion of error bars helps show the model is not perfect, but it doesn’t negate those outside factors. 

within lab 05, knowing that f is equal to m*a from the second newton’s law, it can be derived that $a=\frac{f}{m}$. the value of f can be viewed as the sum of all forces that affect the object. in first experiment, $f = f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}$. plugging this back to the equation, it can be concluded that $a =\frac{f_{hanging} +f_{unknown}}{m}$. if the m was distributed to both f values, this equation can be written as $a =\frac{f_{hanging}}{m} + \frac{f_{unknown}}{m}$, which can be viewed as the mathematical model for linear equation, $y = c1 x +c2$. for the second experiment, knowing that f is equal to m*a from the second newton’s law, it can be derived that $a=\frac{f}{m}$. this representation of the second newton’s law suggests that there is a power relationship between iv and dv. the mathematical model for the linear equation is $y = m x+b$, where m and b are actually the values of great significance for this experiment, in sense that m is 1/mass and $b = \frac{f_{unknown}}{m}$, when derived from the equation $f = f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}$. for lab 06, we found that f is equal to m*a from the second newton’s law, it can be derived that $a=\frac{f}{m}$. the value of f can be viewed as the sum of all forces that affect the object. in the first experiment, $f = f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}$. plugging this back to the equation, it can be concluded that $a =\frac{f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}}{m}$ if the mass was distributed to both f values, which can be viewed as the mathematical model for linear equation, $y = c1 x +c2$. each value being substituted in will give us the correct equation of each graph were looking for.
