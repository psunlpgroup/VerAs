discussion and conclusion 

the purpose of this lab was to investigate the effect of applied force (measured in newtons) on the acceleration of the system (m/s2) as it moves down a track. the research question was “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?” each value of force (n) in table 2 was calculated using the equation $f=m a$ where mass (m) was dependent on the number of bobbers hanging on the end of the string in kilograms (1, 2 or 3, etc.) multiplied by acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2). the total mass of the system (cart and 5 bobbers) remained the same for all trials, .1739 kg, but the number of bobbers hanging on the end increased by one each trial, which is what altered the applied force and, therefore, the acceleration. 

our experimental model, $y=6.2851 x - 0.073$ was found using our graph of acceleration vs. applied force. this model addresses the research question by showing a linear relationship between the applied force and the acceleration of the system, just like the equation $f=m a$. as the applied force increased on the hanging string, so did the acceleration of the system with each trial. since $a=\frac{f}{m}$, the slope of the experimental model, 6.2851, should equal 1/m. in our specific experiment, 1 divided by .1739kg (experimental mass) is equal to 5.45 kg-1, which is close to 6.2851 kg-1. the numbers are not identical because of error, but close enough to conclude that our experimental model answers our research question of how applied force affects the acceleration of the system. 

a. data collected by carlie, macey, zach and nisha in 1051l section 008 phys lab. the results of this group support our hypothesis, that the applied force impacts the acceleration of the system and that it is a linear relationship. for example, the applied force of 45.08n has an acceleration of .255 m/s2, and then an increase in applied force to 180.32n also had an increase in acceleration to .912 m/s2. also, they had the same environmental factors that may or may not have affected their data, like friction on the track. 



data collected by claire, luke, george and aidan in 1051l section 008 phys lab. the results of this group support our hypothesis, in that the applied force impacted the acceleration of the system as a linear relationship. as they increased the applied force, the acceleration of the system also increased. for example, an applied of .0931n had an acceleration of .472 m/s2 and increase to .3322n increased to an acceleration of 1.71 m/s2.


other forces that may be present in the experiment is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2), friction of the track when the cart rolls down it, which would oppose the motion, and air resistance as the string pulls the bobbers down to the floor. the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model as the slope, 6.2851, or 1/m. a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart would affect the acceleration of the system, because the string is accounted for in the total mass of the system, so without the added mass of a string the cart would not accelerate at the same rate than if the string was accounted for in the mass. 

some possible systematic errors that may have occurred were due to the equipment used in the experiment. if the scale was inaccurately zeroed out when weighing the mass of the cart and the bobbers, it would have affected the total mass of the system and our calculation of the applied force. if the mass of the cart changed because of the balance, then the acceleration would also be affected. if the sensor at the end of the track was not calibrated or set up properly, then the acceleration it reads when the cart hit it would be inaccurate, and, therefore, affect the points on our graph and the slope of the line in our experimental model. to avoid these systematic errors, we could weigh multiple items on the balance to double check that the same or similar masses are being repeated. also, we could make sure that the senor is properly calibrated by running multiple trials to test its precision. a random error that occurred during the experiment could have been due to a piece of tape accidentally left on one of the bobbers, impacting the mass of the total system. this could easily be avoided simply by double checking the set up of the experiment and making sure everything is where it should be.

the generalizability of this experiment is limited due to the constraint of how much weight can be added to the end of the hanging string, as well as the height at which they can drop to. in other words, the track would only be put so high before the bobbers hit the ground, which could impact the measured acceleration of the cart. since the weight of the bobbers was so small, it would be difficult to tell what would happen if a larger mass were used. without being able to test a very wide number of applied forces and accelerations, our data cannot be generalized completely.
