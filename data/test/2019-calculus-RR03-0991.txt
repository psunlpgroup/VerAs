discussion and conclusion



	the research question for labs 1 through 3 was the following: what factors have an impact on the period of a pendulum? the factors investigated were mass, angle of release, and length.

	the experiment conducted to determine the relationship between mass and period yielded the conclusion that, in the range of 109.7 to 190.1 g, the two have no correlation. as seen in figure 1, every data point collected falls within the error bars of every other data point, which puts them well within the range of the equivalency criterion for concluding that none of the points are statistically significantly different from one another. these error bars are constructed using the standard deviation of the methods used in lab 1, which was calculated from ten repeated measurements of period for the same experimental setup.

	determining the relationship between the angle of release and period of a pendulum produced similar results; it was concluded that, in the range of 10 to 30 degrees, there is no correlation between angle of release and period. the graph of the data collected in this experiment can be seen in figure 2, with the same error bars being applied as the mass experiment. once again, every data point falls within one standard deviation of the others, suggesting by the equivalency criterion that the differences between each point are statistically insignificant.

	unlike the other two factors, the experiment conducted to determine the relationship between pendulum length and period led to the conclusion that a correlation does exist. specifically, for lengths within the range 26 to 188.1 cm and for angles of release less than 20 degrees there is a positive, non-linear correlation between the length of a pendulum and its period. figure 3 shows the graph of the data collected from this experiment. while error bars are included, their size was drastically reduced in this experiment due to the use of a photogate to measure the pendulum’s period rather than a stopwatch. with error bars too small to be visible, each data point can confidently be considered statistically different from every other data point. 

	the theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum at small angles is the following is 



in this equation t represents the period in seconds, l represents length in meters, and g represents acceleration due to gravity in meters per second squared. this equation notably does not account for the mass or angle of release of the pendulum, suggesting that the conclusions that these factors do not affect period are valid. now, simplifying this equation to include one constant and using units that match those used in experiment three gives the following is 



from this it can be seen that the calculated mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is incredibly close to the theoretically defined equation. the percent errors of the calculated constant and power are 2.991% and 1.080% respectively, suggesting that error other than the ±0.001 s from the photogate impacted the data. furthermore, the near perfect fit of the data collected to the generated model suggests that systematic errors likely shifted the shape of the data. it can be seen in figure 3 that each data point is passed through by the model and also that the model’s r-squared value is 0.9998, meaning that the model fits the data nearly perfectly.

	as mentioned previously, some error must have existed in the methods used for the experiment to yield the error seen in the calculated model. while the methods used in lab 3 did significantly reduce error compared to those used in lab 1, experimental perfection is impossible. as mentioned previously, a small amount of random error is present due to the error of the photogate. this is believed to be the only random error present in this experiment. there are a few possible sources of systematic error that may have skewed results, however. length of the pendulum was measured from the point of rotation at the top of the string to the exact center of the attached mass by removing the top half of the hanging mass plates for measurement. in reality the string and hook are not massless, meaning that the center of mass of the pendulum system was actually slightly above the exact center of the hanging mass. this means that all length measurements were slightly too long. another possible source of systematic error was the choice to record the average period calculated by the data collection software used rather than the first period recorded. while perhaps negligible, each successive oscillation of the pendulum was slightly slower than the last due to friction and air resistance, meaning that the first period measurements were always slightly larger than the average. this may have resulted in period measurements that were slightly too large.

	finally, it is important to reiterate that the conclusions made throughout the course of this and previous labs are only valid within the ranges of values tested and cannot be generalized to all possible values of all the factors tested. these values are specifically discussed in the individual conclusions for each experiment. perhaps the most important limitation of any one of the conclusions drawn, however, is that the model generated is only valid for small angles. at larger angles mass and/or angle of release may begin to affect period, and length may or may not continue to affect period as predicted. this is reaffirmed by the fact that this limitation is attached to the theoretical equation as well.
