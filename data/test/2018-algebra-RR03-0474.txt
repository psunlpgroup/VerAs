conclusion:
In this lab we wanted to determine what impacts the period of a pendulum. Each of the three experiments helped us to determine this by testing each of three independent variables and their affects on the period of a pendulum. We found that in testing how mass affects the period of a pendulum there seemed to be no trend and or correlation between the independent and dependent variables. Error bars for this factor were very small which means that the data was precise (Fig. 1). When testing the length how the length of the string affected the period of the pendulum, we found that as we increased the length of the string, the period of the pendulum also increased. Therefore, we can conclude that the length of the string did indeed affect the period of the pendulum. The error bars on this graph were a bit larger than the other graphs, indicating more spread out data (Fig. 2). Lastly, we tested to see if the angle of release affected the period of the pendulum. We found no correlation between angle of release and the period of the pendulum; therefore, the independent and dependent variable had no correlation. These error bars were very small which indicates precise measurements (Fig. 3).
The theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is as follows in the picture below (Fig 4.) This model was found online and used as a reference. In table 4, calculations were completed to see based on the theoretical mathematical model what the period would be given the same length of string that we used. I can conclude that our data fits well with this model due to the fact that in our data the period decreased as the length of the string decreased. As far as accuracy, I donâ€™t believe our data fits well with the mathematical model. We got numbers in the single digits whereas all of these numbers are double digit numbers. This could be due to any one of the systematic or random errors discussed below. As far as factors that did not affect the period of a pendulum (mass and angle of release), it can be concluded that these factors do not have any correlation with the period of a pendulum. This can be concluded because there is no variable in the mathematical model listed for mass or angles. The only variables listed in the model are time, length, and gravity. Therefore, we can assume that the only factor that affects the period of a pendulum is length of string.
	Errors in this lab were inevitable. We had many random as well as systematic errors in this lab. Systematic errors are defined as errors that result when the actual measurement is not the same as the assumed measurement. These types of errors can happen when instruments are not properly calibrated and or equipment is not functioning properly. Systematic errors that occurred during labs 1-3 were that the string sort of had a bounciness to it, so the measurements of the string may be different each time when different weight was added, we measured the string before adding weight to make sure that this error was reduced. As well as this another systematic error would be that the numbers on the protractor were starting to rub off and began to be hard to read, we reduced this error by using a different protractor.
Random errors are defined as fluctuations in measurements inherent to the measuring device itself or the chosen experimental technique. We had quite a few random errors in labs 1-3. For starters, the protractor was very hard to keep centered and nearly every time we experienced parallax error, to attempt to reduce this we held it as steady as possible and lined our eyes straight up with the protractor. Another random error that we encountered was that it was nearly impossible to stop the timer at the same time every time in order to keep the experiment constant, to reduce this we used the photogate, and this allowed our data to be more constant. 
The only possible limitation in this experiment that may limit the generalizability of our results is time given. In these labs we only had a limited amount of time to set up our plan for the experiment and to then test it and make data tables, graphs, and conclusions. Given more time in our labs, we could have completed more trials in order to make sure that the trends of our independent variables versus dependent variables did or did not show correlation. Also given more time, we could have used the photogate to test all three independent variables and we would be able to make more accurate conclusions as to which variable most affected the period of the pendulum.
