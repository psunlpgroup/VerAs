so, how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? to test for such a relationship, a cart on a level track was attached to a hanging mass, which set the system to have an applied force. these applied force changes evidently affected the acceleration of the cart on the track. as displayed in figure 1, the applied force as the hanging mass, the independent variable, increasing relates to an increase in the acceleration of the system as well. this relationship quantitatively translates to the mathematical model $y=0.004 x + 0.109$ and r^2 is 0.9757 that represents the positive linear relationship the two variables share. error in the experimental data was very small, thus the error bars in the vertical direction are not visible on figure 1. other group data (pictured on the next page) shows the same type of data that relates to the research question. both the “two women group” and “the physics phour” groups stated similar hypotheses and mathematical models for their experiment (picture 1 & 2). their information supports our claim that the hanging mass and acceleration of the cart have a positive linear relationship. the relationship on the graph is $f = f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}$ for applied force and $a=\frac{f_{hanging}+f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$ for acceleration. having such small (almost not visible) error bars on the graph shows how similar the mathematical model is to the theoretical model. in addition, the enhanced theoretical equation for acceleration with more than one force is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, which supports the mathematical model previously written. in another experiment, if there were a heavy string connecting the hanging mass to the cart, the acceleration would be affected by both the hanging mass and the mass of the string connecting the two components together. in this experiment, the string is light in mass, therefore it is not included in the hanging mass affecting the acceleration of the system. random errors include human errors like not releasing the cart from the exact same point for every trial and having the hanging mass swinging slightly versus hanging at rest. to reduce these random errors, the experiment conductors should take more caution in conducting the experiment, since this is solely human error. systematic errors could have occurred due to the system used, whether it was the track being on a slight angle rather than completely level, or the exacts of the computer software, which was used to measure the slope, or acceleration, of the system. these errors are harder to reduce, so having many trials on various tracks and computer systems would reduce the systematic errors listed. one last systematic error is friction between the tracks and the cart, which could be reduced by smoothing out and cleaning the surfaces touching. constraints that arose in this experiment that would be interesting to test would be two factors instead of just one and how other types of mass (i.e. mass of a larger cart) would affect the acceleration instead.
