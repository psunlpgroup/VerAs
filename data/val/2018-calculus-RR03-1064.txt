conclusion:
	for these laboratory experiments, the question being investigated was: what impacts the period of the pendulum for small swings? each of the three experiments conducted allowed us to get a sense of which of the three factors involved is  length of the string, mass of the weight, and the angle of release, could potentially have an affect on the pendulum’s period.

	as depicted in graph 1, the error bars allow the inference to be made that the angle of release might actually have an effect, contrary to our prediction; since as the angle grew larger, it did appear that the period of the pendulum also lengthened. graph 2 confirms our prediction by showing a clear positive correlation between the length of the string and the period; for as the length of the string increases, so does the amount of time it takes for the pendulum to swing. graph 3’s data points are scattered, with no curve able to fit properly through the data points to even hint at the possibility of any relationship, whether it be positive and negative, and thus it can be confirmed that, based on the data we collected, that the mass of the weight does not affect how long a pendulum swings.

	the theoretical math model for the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ where t represents the period, l is the length of the string, and g is the gravitational constant. thus it can be seen automatically how length would indeed have an effect on the period in our experiments as it is in the equation. and now, reflecting back on graph 1, it can be seen how the angle would have an effect due to the nature of pi in the equation, albeit the effect would not be as great as the one from length. thus, i believe that the data collected does in fact support the theoretical model of the pendulum.

	there were a couple of random errors which could have occurred during our experiments. for one, we had two people recording time for some trials, but for others there would only be one, or it would be a machine recording the time based off the motion of the pendulum. these could have been reduced by keeping a consistent strategy where we used the machine and two people to record time and take the average of the three times to reduce any possible errors. there was also the fact that our rounding/estimation methods were inconsistent as seen in the four tables, particularly table 4, and thus some of our numbers were more accurate than others.

	however, there were more than a few constraints which if resolved could have made our data more accurate. there was a time constraint during the first laboratory session which caused our group to not be able to record enough suitable data, and thus the data in tables 1 and 3 are not our own, and we cannot attest for the accuracy of their methods of calculating and receiving the data. as for when we wanted to test the effects of length and the angle of release, we were limited to how large the angle could be, and also of how long the string could be. without these constraints, we could have perhaps seen the effects for if we made the angle particularly large compared to significantly small and been able to have more solid data to present, and the same could be said in terms of the length of the pendulum.
