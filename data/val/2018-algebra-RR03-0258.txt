conclusion 
estimation while measuring using protractor.
reaction time while using stop watch. 	
not knowing when the pendulum makes a full swing.
stop watch is faulty.
length of string didn’t stay at desired measurement. 
not “zeroing” the scale when measuring the mass.
how to reduce these errors
get a more accurate protractor.
use the photogate to get a more accurate reading.


get a better stopwatch.

make sure string is at desired measurement.

zero out the scale every time before weighing mass. 
 from looking at the graph patterns there was no relationship between angle and time and with mass and time. the only significant relationship was between length and time.
