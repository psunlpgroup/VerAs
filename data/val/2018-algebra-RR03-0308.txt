	what impacts the period of pendulum for small swings? this was the research question tested in these experiments. these three experiments helped address the research question by showing the relationship between the variable tested and how it affected the period of pendulum. in graph 1, it shows that the length of string was the only variable that showed to have an effect on the period of pendulum. the standard error bars did not overlap so there was a good amount of change. the string length was the only variable that affected the period of pendulum. looking at graph 2 and 3, you can observe that the variables; mass of pendulum and angle dropped, had little to no effect on the period of pendulum. this is because the standard error bars overlapped, so this shows that there is no change. 

the theoretical mathematical model for the period of pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. our data fits great with this mathematical model, as the value for $y=x^2$ was 0.5, and our value was 0.4223. also, our r value was calculated to be 0.9984, which is very close to 1. this shows that our data fits the theoretical mathematical model. 

there were a few different errors that occurred during this lab. some of the systematic error that occurred were not dropping the pendulum at the exact angle for each trial, not starting and stopping the stop watch at the exact time for each trial, and also rounding the times for each trial. some of the random errors were incorrectly measuring the time on the on the stopwatch when rounding decimals and we only experimented with one trial which lead to inaccurate data. one constraint that occurred in this lab was that the longest string length was 180 cm, so our mathematical model would only work for string lengths under 180 cm.
