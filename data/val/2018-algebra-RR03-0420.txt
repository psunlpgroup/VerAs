discussion and conclusion:



this lab investigated what values impact the period of a pendulum swing. when initially setting up the experiment we, as the researchers, decided the values that would likely have an impact on the time for one swing would have been the mass of the bob, the length of the string, and the angle of release. in experiment 1 (table 1), string length was the independent variable. we picked 5 different values of string length in centimeters and measured the time for 1 swing (table 4) so as to observe whether there was a direct relationship between string length and period and whether this was a positive or negative relationship. after collecting the data, a graph of these points were made (figure 1) and it was determined that there was a direct positive relationship between string length and period of a pendulum. therefore, we were able to answer part of the research question that string length is a value that impact period of a pendulum swing. 

for experiment 2 (table 2), angle of release was the independent variable. we picked 5 different angles that the string would be released from and measured the time for one swing (table 5). after measuring the times for each value, the graph of angle vs time (figure 2) allowed us to determine that there was a direct positive relationship between angle of release and the period of a pendulum, as well. from this investigation, we concluded that angle is another value that impacts the period of a pendulum swing. 

for experiment 3 (table 3), mass of the bob was the independent variable. five different masses were added to the bob and the time for one swing was measured at these different data points (table 6). once the graph was made for these points (figure 3), there was no apparent relationship between mass and time for one swing. this allowed us to determine that mass had no impact on the period of a pendulum swing and that length of string and angle of release were the values that did hold an impact.

the theoretical model that was provided for the period of a pendulum was $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ . using this model, we were able to predict what should be the period of one pendulum swing at 1.418 seconds. using the line of best fit (figure 4) taken from the experiments that used a photo gate to determine period more accurately, we determined the time for one period of a pendulum to be 1.409 seconds. the theoretical time and the time that we found using the power curve were very close in value, which validated our experiments by showing that we had a small region of error. 

there were a few possible sources of error throughout the experiments. many of these being random errors such as inaccurate stopping and starting of the timer, force given to the string when being released, or inaccurate measurement of angle. these are all reduced by measuring many different values repeatedly to find the average of them all. during lab 3, the inaccuracies of the timer were reduced by using a photogate to measure time rather than a stopwatch. there may have been systematic errors present in the experiments, as well, such as inaccuracies of instruments. these errors are reduced by checking that all equipment works properly and understanding that these inaccuracies are present during all measurements, therefore, preventing random error. 

many constraints were present during these experiments that may have limited the generalizability of our results. the moment that the timer decided to stop and start the stopwatch may have differed between each group according to the protractors used and the fact that it is nearly impossible to determine when the string passed the specific angle needed just by sight. if we had used the photogate during lab 1 and lab 2 then the angle and the timing of each period may have been more general between each group because of its ability to more accurately measure the specific angle and time of release/stop for each period swing.
