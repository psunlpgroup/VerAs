conclusion



so in this lab we were trying to find out what affects the time period of a pendulum. at first we thought that only the angle of release, mass of the pendulum and the length of the string affects the time period but we discovered that the mass and the angle only affect it in extreme circumstances. but  if you change the length of the string then you will effect the time period. also if you can change the gravity on the pendulum then you can change the time period as well but we do not have a way to test that in this lab.  using our mathematical model, a pendulum with a length of 0.5m would have a period of 1.53 seconds. using the theoretical model, the period for a pendulum with a length of 0.5 m would be 1.41 seconds. this is only a difference of 0.12 seconds. theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum is             $t=2$              or       $y=1.99$     if you look at our graphs you can see no correlation between the angle of release and time and you can see no correlation between the mass of the pendulum and the time, but you can see a linear relationship between the length of the string and the time. we also find in lab that our angle of release had a random error with it the messed up our results but when we redid the experiment we discovered that yes there was no relationship between the angle and the time. when we found our mathematical model we discovered that most of the groups in the class were very close to ours then we discovered we were the group who was the closest to the the actually theoretical equation. so since we got pretty close to the theoretical equation i believe we can be fairly confident in our numbers, graphs and experiments.
