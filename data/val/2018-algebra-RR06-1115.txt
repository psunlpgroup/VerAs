discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to determine if there is a relationship between the applied force and acceleration in a system. if a relationship was found to exist, the data could be used to generate a mathematical model of the relationship. to address this research question, an experiment was conducted by measuring the acceleration of a system consisting of a cart with bobbers hanging from it via a string. the cart rested on top of an air track with the string draped over a pulley so that the bobbers hung towards the ground. when released, the cart travelled down the air track as propelled by the weight of the bobbers hanging from the string. in order to keep the mass of the system constant, the remaining bobbers not hung from the end of the string were attached to the cart. the mass of the bobbers at the end of the string were varied for a total of eight trials with eight different hanging masses. the different hanging masses were the means by which the force on the cart was changed, where the applied force equaled the mass of the hanging bobbers times g (9.8) to give a force in newtons. for each trial, the cart was released at the 600 mm mark on the air track and the datastudio program measured the velocity of the system. velocity vs. time graphs were generated by this program, where the acceleration could be determined from the slope of line for each trial. the acceleration vs. applied force data were graphed for each of the different force measurements, generating a linear plot with a best fit line of $a=4.8214 f + 0.002$ where a is acceleration and f is applied force. this equation represents the mathematical model for the system.

the linear trend of the data indicate that varying the force exerted on a system does impact the acceleration with a direct positive relationship (increasing applied force increases the acceleration), which supports our hypothesis. by changing the mass in each trial (independent variable), the acceleration (dependent variable) also changed, and this demonstrates that acceleration is dependent upon the whether a force is applied to a system. the very small horizontal and vertical error bars indicate that the observed relationship from our data is likely true because the datastudio program minimized the amount of random error in this experiment. additionally, the error bars did not overlap with one another for separate data points, indicating that the data points are distinct from one another. the equivalency criterion of 2 standard deviations still did not overlap with other data points, so the distinct data points can be assumed to not be equivalent to one another. also, the trendline passed through all of the error bars, which further supports the validity of the data and our claim that the acceleration of a system is dependent upon applied force in a linear relationship.
the data from group 2 closely agrees with the data obtained by our group for this lab (see figure 2). similar to our data, group 2 found a linear relationship between the acceleration of the system and the applied force (mass) of the system. their mathematical model was $a=4.9681 f+0.0076$, which differed slightly from our mathematical model of $a=4.8214 f+0.002$. this discrepancy could be due to the fact that the mass of their system was slightly less than the total mass of our system (186.3 g vs. 188.5 g, respectively). this would contribute to the higher c1 and c2 values for group 2’s mathematical model because c1 is 1/(mass of system) and $c2=\frac{f_{un}}{m_{sys}}$, where the mathematical model is $a=c1 f+c2$. despite these differences in mass measurements, the overall linear relationship supports our claim that the acceleration of a system is dependent upon the applied force to the system. 

the data from group 1 also closely aligns with our group’s findings (see figure 3). as we found, group 1 also discovered that there is a linear relationship between acceleration and applied force to a system. the mathematical model that they obtained was $a=4.224f+0.0858$ which was similar to our mathematical model ($a=4.8214 f+0.002$) but strayed from our model slightly more than group 2’s model. this is somewhat surprising because the mass of of the system used by group 1 was 189.55 g, which was closer to our system’s mass of 188.5 g than group 2’s system mass. this discrepancy could be due to systematic errors such as incorrect calibration of the datastudio program or the scale used to measure the mass, inconsistencies when releasing the system for each trial (letting the hanging mass swing, etc.), or differing contributions of friction and other unknown forces. this could have caused the differing c1 and c2 values in our mathematical models because these contributors would have impacted the accelerations that were used to produce the mathematical models. overall, we both determined that there is a linear relationship between applied force and acceleration, which supports our conclusion.
the theoretical model for the effects of force on the acceleration of a system is represented by newton’s second law, where $f=m a$. this can be arranged as $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. when only one applied force is involved, this aligns with our experimental model of  $a=c1 f+c2$, where  f is mg so weight of the hanging mass, c1 is 1/(mass of system), and $c2=\frac{f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$. from this equation, a theoretical model that fits our system with a total mass of 188.5 g would be $a=5.3 f +\frac{f_{un}}{m_{sys}}$, where 5.3 is the slope of the line obtained by 1/.1885. this matches closely with the equation that we obtained ($a=4.8214 f+0.002$) where the slope of the line is 4.8214. when more than one force is involved in system, the acceleration can be found using the enhanced theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. this is demonstrated where external forces such as friction and air resistance contributed to our mathematical model in the form of the y-intercept of .002. other unknown forces could include friction from the air track and the cart, friction from the string on the pulley, and the force of air resistance. these could have minimal effects on the experimental model, which could explain the discrepancies from the theoretical model, which do not include these forces. these external forces appear in the c2 value in the experimental model, which equals unknown forces/mass of the system. the r^2 value for our curve of .9965 also indicates that the curve fits the data very nicely, so this experimental model is a good representation of our data. keeping the mass of the system constant throughout the experiment by attaching bobbers to the cart when they were not included in the hanging mass also allows this to be a linear relationship because slope could be represented by 1/mass of the system, which could not be the case if the mass of the system changed. 
if the string had a large amount of mass, this would affect the uniform acceleration of the cart because the greater contribution of the mass of the string would cause a greater amount of friction between the string and the pulley. when the weight of the hanging mass is increased, the frictional force would also increase, making the acceleration less than would be expected in a frictionless system, and causing the experimental model to stray further from the theoretical model.
very few random errors were present in this experiment because the precision of datastudio program controlled for these errors. however, factors such as allowing the hanging mass to swing right before it was released could exert additional forces on the system that would cause the acceleration values to deviate from expected, contributing to the vertical error bars. making sure to stabilize the hanging mass before releasing the cart could reduce this error. systematic errors may have been present in this system as well, likewise affecting the mathematical model through acceleration and/or force measurements that were consistently higher or lower than expected, and this would affect the slope of the mathematical model. these could include the datastudio program being calibrated incorrectly, causing acceleration measurements to stray from expected values. additionally, the scale being calibrated incorrectly could cause the force measurements to be an inaccurate representation of the true masses. to reduce this error, equipment should be calibrated with a control beforehand, such as weighing a known mass and taking the difference between expected and measured mass into account for subsequent measurements. also, the speed of the air from the air track could impact the amount of friction involved in the system, and if this differed between groups, it could explain discrepancies in our experimental models. if the air traveled at a slower speed, friction would play a greater role, and acceleration measurements would be less because of this. making sure to have an air track that is properly functioning would reduce this error.
constraints to this experiment that could limit the generalizability of the results would include the limited number of trials performed. however, the overall agreement of our data with other groups reduces this limitation. additionally, our system consisted of a relatively small total mass of 188.5 g, so results cannot be generalized for mass values above or below this value. limitations inherent to the measuring devices such as the calibration marks on the scale and the degree of precision of the datastudio program, in addition to systematic errors involving this equipment, also limit how much the results can be generalized. one major limitation involving the experimental setup was that friction was still involved, despite using an air track, a thin, smooth string, and a metal cart, which explains why the experimental model strays from the mathematical model. for these reasons, our data must be interpreted with discretion.
