discussion and conclusion:

	this experiment was conducted to determine the relationship between applied force and acceleration. specifically, this lab aimed to answer how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. 

	to conduct this lab, a hanging weight was involved and changed, therefore affecting the applied force on the system and serving as the independent variable. data were then collected to determine the resulting acceleration, the dependent variable, when this applied force changed. specifically, the mass of the system was held at a controlled 174.05 grams and the track distance for the cart on the air track was held at a controlled 76.2 centimeters. though the mass was held constant, the applied force on the system would increase with each trial because bobs were taken off of the gold cart and added as hanging weights on a pulley to determine exactly how the acceleration would be affected, as demonstrated in table 1. the acceleration was able to be found through the use of the datastudio software program and the rotary motion detector. a velocity vs. time graph would be generated by the software program, and the slope of this graph was then determined to find the acceleration of the resulting system with each change in applied force. 

	after conducting this experiment, it seemed to show that as the applied force increased, the acceleration increased as well, as shown in table 2. figure 1 further supported this claim because of the linear relationship that was able to be seen. figure 1 also did display error bars but were too small to be visible because of the fact that the scale error was a given value of 0.001 for the rotary motion detector and its corresponding velocity vs. time graph. the general trendline, in conjunction with the error bars help to further support the claim that as the applied force increases in this system, the acceleration increases as well. with this data and graph at hand, a mathematical model was able to be calculated to find the specific relationship between the two variables. in this case, it was found that $a=4.1719 f + 0.047$ where a is acceleration and f is the applied force.  this equation displays a linear relationship, with a positive slope, thus showing that as the applied force increases the acceleration will increase as well. 

	another group’s findings were also used and understood to support the claim made in this lab about the relationship between applied force and acceleration of the system. as shown in figure 2, a general trend is noticed that as the applied force increases so too does the acceleration of the system, which is further emphasized in figure 4. not only is a linear relationship noticeable on the graph, but the general mathematical model the group generated of 

$a=5.1366 f - 0.0022$ where a and f are acceleration and force respectively, also shows a linear relationship with a positive slope as well. the same could be said about group 2 as well. the data displayed in figure 3 show a general trend of acceleration increasing as applied force increased which is further exacerbated in figure 5 with the linear trend of the data points and the linear mathematical model of $a=4.0317 f + 0.0603$ where a and f are again acceleration and force. therefore, all three groups’ findings support each other and support the claim that acceleration increases as applied force increases.   

	when considering the acceleration of a system, when just one force is acting on a system, the theoretical equation would be $f=m a$, where a is the acceleration of the system, f is the net force, or in this case the applied force, and m is the mass of the system. the mathematical model generated does support this theoretical equation in that the curve fitting, based off all the data points obtained in the lab, for both display a linear relationship. in this case, the y-intercept of 0.0475 in the mathematical model can be considered negligible because of curve fitting. the theoretical equation would have some form of a linear slope, which matches the linear slope, of 4.1719, generated in the model. the slope for the mathematical model was positive but, regardless of the sign, they would both support each other because of the fact that there is a linear curve fitting present. in this scenario, as the applied force increased, while the mass of the system was constant, the acceleration increased as well. when considering the theoretical equation, this increase in acceleration would be seen as well when the applied force increases, and the mass remains constant. since the mass of the system remains constant, but the applied force increases, both the mathematical model and theoretical equation would display a linear curve fitting. in this mathematical model, the mass is the inverse of the slope which is why the applied force is able to impact the acceleration of the system and the mass is held constant. 

	when more than one force is acting on a system, the theoretical equation would be 

$a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, where a is acceleration, f is the applied force,  are the external forces, and m is the mass of the system. external forces would most prominently include friction in this scenario. tension force is negligible assuming the mass of the string is negligible as well. this equation is also consistent with the mathematic model generated because of the presence of the y-intercept, of 0.0475, in the mathematical model. while the mathematical model is consistent with the theoretical equation related to a single force and multiple forces, the theoretical equation related to multiple forces is a more accurate representation because of the fact that the frictional force is no longer negligible and is considered to find the acceleration of the system. a track with friction would cause a smaller acceleration, even with an increase in applied force, compared to a track that was frictionless. this frictionless scenario can be set up to the best of one’s ability, but friction cannot just be taken away completely, and thus, will still be present in some way shape or form. this extra force is then included as part of the mathematical model with the y-intercept and is also included in the theoretical equation with /m. the relationship would still be linear, but the acceleration would be lower than what it would be if the track were absolutely frictionless. both the mathematical model and the theoretical equation take the external forces into account which is why they are even more alike with each other. 

	now, if the string used to connect the gold cart to the bobs had a mass that was not negligible, then the acceleration of the system would still display a uniform acceleration. the mass of the entire system includes the mass of the string; they are not considered as separate entities. therefore, if the string had an appreciable mass, then its mass would be considered as part of the system itself. the mass of the system is now increased, but that is the only aspect that would have changed. by changing the applied force on this new mass of the system, the acceleration would still be uniform. yes, it would be different than the uniform acceleration found throughout this specific experiment with a string of negligible mass, but in its own scenario, the acceleration would still be uniform because the mass would be larger but would still be controlled in the end. the uniform acceleration here would be higher than the acceleration that involved a heavy string, but the acceleration within the experiment itself would still be uniform in both cases. 

	throughout this lab, there were some random errors that were present which would have affected the mathematical model obtained for the relationship between acceleration of the system and the applied force on the system. one major random error includes inaccurate measurement of the bobs or the gold cart on the triple beam balance, which would have affected the acceleration seeing as how the mass of the system would have been slightly different. the acceleration would be uniform, but the mathematical model would be more inaccurate because of higher or lower acceleration values depending on if measurements were under or over the actual mass. this error could be remedied by having one person consistently measure the mass and avoid any random error associated with different individuals having different perspectives. additionally, having multiple different measurements of the mass of the bob and the mass of the gold cart could be used to find the average masses. another random error could have been inaccurately measuring the track length for the gold cart, based off the measurement increments given on the track itself. this error could have been avoided by using some form of an external mark or indicator on the track to signify exactly where each release point should be for when the cart would begin before its path of motion. lastly, if the bobs, as hanging weights, were not as evenly placed as possible on the string, then the acceleration could have been affected because the full potential of accelerated movement may not have been attained. this could have caused uneven movement and acceleration. had the bobs been evenly placed out, the acceleration could have been more consistent. this error could have been avoided by using the bobs that were most similar in mass and placing them evenly so to have a general square formation where the mass would be evenly distributed. though systematic errors are unlikely here, there was a possibility of incorrect increments on the air track and inaccurate balances on the triple beam balance. these could have been ameliorated by using multiple different tracks to see how the gold cart moved on different tracks and by using multiple different triple beam balances to calculate the average mass. 

	this experiment also involved some constraints that would have affected the generalizability of the results. most prominently was a time constraint that prevented the completion of many more trials, which would have given more consistent results, that could be observed for individuals outside of the lab as well. there was also a constraint that involved the number of group members present. had there been more group members, more trials could have been conducted and a higher attention to error would have allowed for more accurate and consistent results. another constraint was the presence of only one environment and one set of equipment that was provided. by conducting this experiment with different forms of equipment and in a different set of conditions, more consistent results would have been obtained with generalized results that could easily be understood in any and all situations. this lab does not only need to be conducted with the given equipment and in a classroom to see the obtained results; testing this experiment in different areas and with different forms of equipment would make the findings much more reliable.
