discussion and conclusion 

the purpose of these experiments was to answer the question- what factors affect the period of a pendulum? mathematical models were created in order to test the three factors hypothesized to be related to the swing of a pendulum, and once these models were tested experimentally, the raw data was used to produce a graph with which to visualize the relationship between the independent variables and the period. 
for the angle of release, it was predicted that that smaller the angle, the shorter the period. this inversely proportional relationship was shown to be false because changing the angle did not result in significantly different periods. this is demonstrated in figure 1 where the error bars overlap quite heavily already so, applying the equivalency criterion of  would lead to even more overlap. there also seems to be no particular trend between the data points. this is evidence that angle of release does not affect the period of a pendulum. 
next, it was predicted that the heavier the mass of the pendulum, the shorter the period and this was shown to be false as well. changing the mass did not result in significant changes in the period, as demonstrated by the overlapping error bars and lack of a specific trend in figure 2. again, applying the equivalency criterion would just result in more overlap of the error bars so, 95% of the values for period would still lie within the uncertainty range. we seem to have an outlier at $x=70$ but its presence does not change the lack of relationship between mass of pendulum and period. 
finally, the prediction that increasing the length of the string will result in a longer period was demonstrated to be true, as seen in figure 3. the error bars do not overlap, even when the equivalency criterion is applied, and they are in fact so small that they are not even visible in the graph. the data also shows a positive relationship between length of string and period and the data points lie in a power curve with a regression value of 0.99846. the equation from the graph was $y=0.1215568 x$ which is close to the theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum, . 
the obtention of the full theoretical mathematical model was not possible due to presence of random and systematic errors. the possible random errors present during the experiment were response time when measuring the period with the stopwatch, measuring length of the string and measuring the release angle. in order to reduce these random errors, a motion gate or a slow-speed camera can be used to measure the period while more precise measuring devices can be used to measure the length of string and angle. these measurements should be done at eye-level to reduce parallax error. the possible systematic errors were the pendulum swinging at an odd angle, air resistance and changing length of the string while the pendulum is moving due to not being secured properly by the knobs in the apparatus. these errors can be reduced by performing the experiments in a vacuum and maybe using a robotic arm to release the pendulum. to prevent the string from slipping off, a clamp can be used to hold it in place. 
for these experiments, time was a constraining factor so, it was not possible to take repeated readings to ensure more precision in our results.
