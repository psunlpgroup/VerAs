discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of the force and motion lab was to investigate how changing mass or force affects the acceleration of the system and develop an experimental model to describe the real system’s behavior. in lab five two factors were investigated, the mass of the hanging bob and the mass of the cart, to determine the relationship of the force to the acceleration in a real system. in lab six the individual variables were introduced to different levels of magnetic friction to determine whether the relationships stayed consistent with the results from lab five.

in lab five, two specific questions were asked in order to develop an experimental model to describe the acceleration of a real system. the first question investigated in the lab was, how does the acceleration of a system change when the mass of the hanging bob of the cart changes. this part of the experiment investigated the impacts of the hanging mass changing on the acceleration while keeping the mass of the cart constant. hanging bobs with a mass of 5 grams were then added one by one to the end of the pulley and the acceleration was measured by the photogate with a constant starting distance. this was repeated until eight different hanging masses and accelerations were found and graphed. in figure 1, the mass of the hanging bob was graphed versus the acceleration with the error bars depicting the uncertainties of +/- 0.01 grams for the mass and +/- 0.001 m/s^2. the error bars calculated are minuscule and do not cross one another meaning that there is a relationship between the hanging mass and the acceleration of the system. in figure 2, it is found that the mass of the hanging bob and acceleration have a positive linear correlation with a mathematical model of $a=2.8397 m + 0.015$ where a is acceleration in m/s^2 and m is mass in kg. the positive slope depicts is relationship and a high r² value of 0.9982 depict that the results were accurate as well as positively correlated. in order to find the final mathematical model to describe the relationship of this real system, all the masses were multiplied by gravity (9.8 m/s^2) to find the force of the hanging mass on the system. in figure 3, the force was graphed by the acceleration and found to have the same linear fit with a high r² of 0.9982 again. the mathematical model found is $a=2.8397 f + 0.015$ where a is acceleration in m/s^2 and f is force in newtons. the model depicts that force and acceleration not only have a positive linear correlation, but also have a causal relationship where as force of the hanging bob increases the acceleration increases when cart mass is held at a constant 0.30151 kg. 

the second question tested in lab 5 was, how does the acceleration of a system change when the mass of the cart changes. this part of the experiment investigated the impacts of the mass of the cart on the acceleration of the cart with a constant hanging bob mass. the experiment was conducted first with the initial mass of the cart (301.15g) and utilizing the photogate to find the acceleration. this was then repeated eight times with 50 gram increments. in figure 4, the mass of the cart in kilograms was graphed versus the acceleration, with error bars depicting the uncertainties of the mass and acceleration as before that is minuscule and do not cross meaning a relationship exists between the two variables. in figure 5, the mass was multiplied by 9.8 or gravity to find the force of the cart and compared it to the acceleration of the system. it graph depicted a negative exponential fit as the highest r² value was 0.9881 which depicts a high correlation in the slope to the data points. this creates a mathematical model of $a = 1.864 e^{-0.194 f}$ where a is acceleration and f is force of the cart. the mathematical model demonstrates that there is a negative exponential correlation between the force of the cart and its acceleration. it also has a casual negative exponential correlation meaning that as the force of the cart grows larger, the acceleration becomes exponentialy smaller when the mass of the hanging bob is held constant at 0.040 kg.

the lab six investigation was focused on determining the deeper relationship between how the mass of the hanging affects the acceleration of a system in part one of lab five by adding the impact of magnetic friction. the question trying to be answered in lab six was, how does the change in the applied force due to gravity affect the acceleration of the system with changing amounts of magnetic friction. in order to find the impacts magnetic friction had on the relationship between the applied force of the hanging mass and the acceleration the group added four magnetic strips, two on either side of the cart, and repeated part one of lab five with changing the mass of the bob eight times. this was then repeated with two acting magnetic strips, one on either side, and two on the top to account for the mass of the overall cart being held constant. it was also repeated one more time with the four magnetic strips on top of the cart, but not acting on the track as well. when the force of bob was graphed in figure 6. with the acceleration when there were four acting magnets there was found to be a positive linear correlation like the figure 3. from the first experiment in lab five. this is represented a linear relationship with an r² value of 0.9987 and by a mathematical model of  $a = 1.8483 f – 0.0381$ where a is the acceleration and f is the force of the hanging bob. the slope is positive and greater then one depicting that as the force of the hanging bob increases the acceleration increases if all other factors are held constant. the same relationship was depicted in figure 7. when only two magnets were acting on the cart. the mathematical model is $a = 1.8625 f -0.0197$ where a is acceleration and f is the force of the hanging bob. it was found by the mathematical model that the force if the hanging bob has a stronger positive relationship than the four magnetic strips because it has a larger slope by 0.02. this demonstrates that there may be a correlation between the amount of friction in the system and the acceleration at different applied forces. lastly, in figure 8. it is depicted that there is an even stronger positive linear correlation between the applied force of the bob and the acceleration because the mathematical model has a slope of 1.8747 which is approximately 0.01 larger than the two magnets. the final mathematical model for no magnetic friction is $a = 1.8747 f -0.0004$. the correlations were then graphed together in figure 9 where it was depicted that the relationship between the applied force of the hanging bob and the acceleration were affected by the magnetic frictional force meaning that the less force applied on the system the more correlation between the applied force and the acceleration.

	group 5, pictured on the bottom left, also conducted the affects of magnetic strips on the relationship between the applied hanging force from the bob and the acceleration. in their hypothesis they claimed that as friction changes, the acceleration of bob also changes. their hypothesis is then supported by similar data of the slope of the force becoming smaller as more magnetic strips acted on the system. their claim and data support the findings of our group because we also found a negative correlation between the force of friction added to the system and the applied forces. group 5 also found that the applied force of the hanging bob and the acceleration had a positive linear correlation at each of the frictions, further supporting our findings. the information from group 5 allows for a larger confidence in the relationships found between forces and acceleration. 

	group 6, pictured on the bottom right, did not test the magnetic friction on the system, but instead the angle on the acceleration if their cart. there was no claim presented on their board; however, their findings depict that the relationship between force and acceleration is positively correlated and linear for each tested angle. in addition, their data demonstrates that angles above the horizontal decrease the acceleration in the slope and as angles below the horizontal increase the acceleration increases. unlike our data, group six utilized mass as their independent variable instead of force depicting a slight smaller impact on the acceleration the magnetic friction had. although group 6 did not do the same investigated variable, their results depict that their lies a positive linear correlation between the applied hanging force and the acceleration as well as depict that as more force is added to the system or required of the cart, the smaller the slope is.
	within both lab five and lab six there were many random errors and some systematic errors that occurred and were reduced as the experiments took place. random errors that could have occurred include starting the cart at a slightly different place each time, calculating the mass of the hanging bobs slightly incorrectly. if the cart started from a different measurement due to human error, the acceleration of the cart would be off in small increments changing the slopes slightly. in order to reduce this subtle error, there would be a specific point on the cart that is always used to line up the cart. the mass of each bob measured was 5 grams; however, some of the bobs are worn down and have cracks which would cause for a slight difference increments of the mass that could affect the acceleration. utilizing better equipment such as an electronic balance would allow for each of the bobs to have more accurate measurements. a large systematic error that occurred for our group was the in lab five when the computer system would not graph our system. this caused for the group to have to wait for other groups to be done utilizing the equipment and for the use of two different tracks. although each of the two tracks were the same, there could be slight inconsistencies with each of the pulley systems and the track itself causing the quantities to be measured inaccurately. this error could be eliminated by utilizing the same system the whole time, so the results were more precise and could be accurately measured against one another. also, if there was one system where all the controls could be constant the data would be more accurate, and the group would not have to rush causing other errors like putting the cart at the incorrect place causing slight errors.

	constraints that may limit the generalizability of the results found were the factor of air resistance was not accounted for, as air resistance could lead to friction on the cart slowing its acceleration as the cart moved throughout the track. also, the mass of the string and pulley were accounted as massless; however, the small amounts of mass that were present may have caused some slight inaccuracies in the data. also, there may have been friction between the string and the pully which would have caused for energy and force to leave the system, slowing down the acceleration of the cart and not accounting for the thermal heat loss. lastly, the system could not be made a vacuum originally with completely no frictional force, so their may still be friction causing the system to not be completely accurate.

	the mathematical models found of  $a=2.8397 f + 0.015$ from part one of lab five with the changing hanging mass, $a = 1.864 e^{-0.194 f}$ from the changing mass of the cart, and $a = 1.8483 f - 0.0381$ from the four acting magnet strips are all consistent with newton’s second law of motion. newton’s second law states the force is equal to the mass times its acceleration. in all examples of our mathematical models, if constants were ignored the constants or y-intercepts and acceleration by the slope, there would be the generic form of newton’s second law. in other words, the equation is broken up as  $c1 f +c2 = a$, where our c1 value is 1/mass in kilograms. this would then recreate newton’s second law of $f = m a$, which makes our findings consistent.
