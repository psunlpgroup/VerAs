	the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of real systems, like a car on a track. in the second part of the lab, variables in the equations were related back to the experiment. the experiments in lab 05 led to the mathematical model $a=0.0027 f - 0.0441$. in this equation, a is acceleration, f is the force applied, and the coefficient at the end is left for error. you can see this pattern represented in the graph because as force increases, the acceleration increased with a linear relationship. the second equation from lab 05 was $a = 6e^{-06} m2 - 0.009 m + 3.1507$. 

	random error could have been present in our experiment. this could have been from the equipment we used. systematic error is more likely, though. if the car was not placed in the exact same starting point each time, our data could have systematic error. to reduce these errors in the future, a more precise way of measuring the start point could have been used. a constraint in the experiment that could limit generalizability is size. a much larger range of data could be recorded if larger forces or friction could be applied. another factor that could reduce generalizability is amount of data. with more trials and data points, it is easier to show patterns on a large scale. the two models are consistent with newtonâ€™s second law. this is the sum of all forces is equal to the mass of the system times the acceleration. both of the mathematical models are the same form as this formula with force applied and mass of the system affecting acceleration.
