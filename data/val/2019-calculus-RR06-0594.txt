discussion and conclusion:

	the purpose of lab 05 is to develop mathematical models to see how acceleration is impacted by either the hanging mass or the mass of the system. both experiments tested a real system to see how close the mathematical models would be to newton’s second law. the purpose of lab 06 is to create an understanding of where the numerical values from the mathematical models came from.

	for our first experiment of testing how the hanging mass will affect acceleration we started with just one bobber as the hanging mass and the other 7 bobbers on the cart. after each trial, we moved on bobber from the cart to hanging mass and repeated this for all 8 trials. doing this made sure we kept the control variable of the system mass the same throughout the experiment. we took all the data from table 4 and plotted it with a linear fit trendline creating our mathematical model as shown on figure 1 of $a=2.923 f - 0.0293$. the 2.923 from the model represents 1 / mass. the value under the table 4 is 2.954 which is 1 / 0.338g. both values are very similar showing how accurate our data is. the second numerical value from the model is -0.0293. we concluded after doing lab 06 that this value represents the opposing force to the system which could be caused by a slope that is slightly inclined instead of perfectly horizontal allowing gravity to pull the cart some in the opposing direction. if the track was perfectly level and there are no other opposing forces, then the second value should have been 0. the r^2 value from figure 1 is 0.9999 which is extremely close to the value of 1. this means that nearly all the data points fit perfectly to the trendline that the model was created from.

	our second experiment tested to see how the system mass impacted the acceleration of the system. to do this we added weights to the top of the cart and then removed one after each trial leaving the control hanging mass the same. all the data for the trials were collected into table 5. the data was then plotted on a graph and fit to a power trendline. this created the mathematical model as shown on figure 2 of $a=\frac{0.267}{f^{0.997}}$. the 0.267 represents the hanging mass of 0.0288 * 9.8 m/s^2 to get the hanging weight. when you calculate the hanging weight from our data in table 5 you get 0.282 which is close to the value from the model showing how accurate our data is. the second value from the mathematical model of -0.997 should be -1 this way it makes the model relate to newton’s second law. when looking at the graph of the data shown in figure 2 it can be seen that the r^2 value for the data points is 1 which means all the data points fall perfectly on the trendline showing that the mathematical model is very accurate.

	in lab 06 we created an experiment to get a better understanding of what the numerical values from the mathematical models represented.  to test this, we repeated the process from experiment 1 above three times, but we changed the slope of the track for each trial. the three different slopes were 1 cm decline, 3 cm decline, and 1.2 cm incline. we collected all this data into table 6 above. for each trial we created a graph of the data along with a mathematical model from the linear trendline on figures 3-5. for the 1 cm decline we had a model of $a=2.9005 f + 0.0121$. for the 3 cm decline we had a model of $a=2.8165 f + 0.1086$. for the 1.2 cm incline we had a model of $a=2.9333 f - 0.0894$. from this we can see the first numerical value did not really change from the original, but the second numerical value is affected by the slope of the track. when the slope was at a decline the second number is positive showing that there is some force that is helping to accelerate the system and the greater the slope then the greater the additive force. this makes sense because then gravity would be helping to pull the system down the decline. for the trial with an incline we got a negative second force which is like our original model from experiment 1.

	the picture in figure 6 shows the results of group 5 that also tested different slopes with hanging mass vs acceleration experiment. their conclusion supports our conclusion from lab 06 of that as the slope increases it increases the applied force of gravity on the system. also, when looking at the models they came up with you can see that their first two models for a decline slope have a positive second numerical value and their model for the incline trial was a negative value just like our models from lab 06. 

	group 4 is shown in figure 7, they test a different experiment than us for lab 06. they tested how the distribution of where the mass was placed impacted acceleration. their models show that when the mass is close to the top instead of the bottom then it has increase in second numerical value. this increase in value they hypothesis is from friction because the different displacement in mass affects how the cart sits on the track changing the friction value. this could be another reason why we did not get 0 for our second numerical value in experiment 1.

	we had systematic error in experiment 1 for testing the hanging mass against acceleration. our second numerical value from the mathematical model that represented y-intercept was -0293 instead of 0. this could have been because the track was at a slight incline based on our lab 06 testing or there was a frictional force as tested by group 4 in lab 06. to try to reduce the amount of friction we could have tried to move the displacement of mass on the system or we could try adding some type of lubricant to the track to help with the air make the track frictionless. random error was shown from the error bars on figure 1 and figure 2. however, the error was so small that the bars cannot be seen telling us that there was no real random error.

	the biggest constraint in this lab was time. if we had more time would have been able to test another experiment for lab 06. one like group 4 did this way would have more evidence to see how our data stacks up to other groups and create a better understanding of the mathematical models. with this information we had even more data to prove that both the models from experiments 1 and 2 are based off newton’s second law. therefore, we wanted a value of -1 for experiment 2 to show that we are dividing the force and mass to get acceleration. for experiment 1 we had a secondary value added on to the end of the model this shows the other forces that acting on the real system like newton’s second law equation.
