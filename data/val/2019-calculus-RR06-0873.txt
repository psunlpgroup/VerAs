discussion and conclusion

from both experiment with one being no friction and the other with friction, the research question was able to be answered. from the hypothesis of, â€œthe acceleration will decrease as the mass (m2) increases, with the provided evidence shown, that it is not true. however, the conclusion of the group came to be when an applied force increases, the acceleration will increase. therefore, the applied force would be the hanging mass. from testing, the group was able to see that the was a change in acceleration once changing the mass to the hanging object. where it ranged from 4.5 grams to 33 grams in total to determine whether the acceleration increases or decreases. by looking at the graphs and data provided, there was a relationship between the force and acceleration, where both was increased as the masses changed. 

	however, there were some limitations within this lab, there were a variety of masses from the bobs. therefor having to measure it on the balance which is also another factor. the balance does provide accurate measurement with a 0.1g of uncertainty, which is a systematic error. even though these constraints were given upon the group, the conclusion that was provided from the data supports the research question. although the hypothesis was wrong, it still followed newtons second law of physics by using the equation $f=m a$. where m is the mass of the system, showing that it is constant throughout the experiment making the equation turn into $a=\frac{f}{m}$. which causes the force and acceleration to increase, thus proving the research question to be valid and true.
