conclusion:

	what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? after the three lab periods were spent testing whether or not string length, mass of the pendulum, and angle effects a period length, we concluded that only the length of the string does. for our mass vs period length graph, the slope of the line of best fit was practically zero. the slope of the angle vs period length graph was slightly sloped upward but so slight that its practically zero. as for the string length vs period length graph, the slope is clearly very linear and very positive. the r-squared value was .97 so obviously the two have a correlation between the two. we had two main errors from our data points but those were simply because of human error. our best guess is that the time was just taken poorly for one round. this could have been avoided by using some sort of machine that starts ad stops the stopwatch as soon as the pendulum is released and goes for one whole period.
