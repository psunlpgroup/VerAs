discussion and conclusion- 

	the research question that was investigated through out the last three labs was to test whether angle of release, mass of weight, or length of string influenced the period of the pendulum. the three experiments addressed the researched questions by testing the hypothesis, find the error analysis in each trial, and finding the mathematical model that fits the data. the first lab allowed for data to be collected by changing the three different variables and testing them each individually and running multiple tests on each variable to have an accurate sample that can be later used to find the most accurate conclusion to the research question, and to show that despite error the only variable that had an effect on the period of the pendulum as shown in graphs 1-3. the second lab allowed the systematic and random error to be found in the experiment and show the different external variables that affected the minimal fluctuation between different tests, this is show in data tables 1-3. the different tests could be averaged to find a more accurate period for the pendulum. this lab showed systematic and random error in the start and stop accuracy in the stop watch, the lengths being slightly different each time it was measured, and the release time compared to the actual start and stop of the stop watch. the third lab allowed for a mathematical model to be created by testing the single variable that had the most affect on the period of the pendulum. this allowed for more testing on a system that was more accurate which allowed for less human error to be involved in the final data. this also allowed for more in-depth testing by running more test and having a more accurate average time. the mathematical model for the period of the pendulum was that as the longer the string the more time it would take for a period to be completed. this was shown in the final testing of the length which gave an accurate example of this hypothesis and proves its validity, as shown in graph and table 1. the other factors such as angle and mass were also tested but showed no effect on the period of the pendulum even taking into account the systematic and random error that occurred through out the lab. there were multiple random and systematic errors that occurred through out the lab such as in the first lab the length of the string wasn’t measured from the center of the string. other errors that occurred were slight differences in start and stop time with the stopwatch, release angles changing slightly based on test because they were measured in accurately or the measuring device wasn’t extremely accurate, and the lengths being slightly different between the three tests. these errors were corrected by using a computer-generated time that measured the time of a period more accurately then a stop watch and measuring the length multiple times before running each test to ensure that the measurement was correct. constraints that effected this experiment and limited the generalizability of our results were that the equipment provided didn’t allow for precise measurements and the timing of the release of the pendulum include random error that wasn’t able to be corrected. this creates a degree of uncertainty that would impact the overall results of the experiment.
