conclusion:
This experiment was performed to identify which factor has the biggest impact on the period of the pendulum. The factors included in this study included length of string in inches, angle of release of pendulum and the mass of the pendulum. Each factor was tested multiple times to reduce error for each individual component. The data in the graphs included in this report represents the factor vs time relationship. Each Factor was tested at five different measurements to determine if there was a relationship that could be identified numerically. Of the three factors it was agreed upon that the angle of release would have the largest effect on the period of the pendulum. Below are our results for this experiment. 




Errors associated with the three completed experiments would include random errors and systematic errors. One random error that was not considered was measuring the time using a hand-held stopwatch. Visually determining the length of the period with a hand-held timer may not have been as accurate as measuring it with a photogate. Another random error included with our experiments was using the 90-degree angle of release. Because of such a great angle of release it would be hard to accurately determine that the pendulum was released at the correct angle. Any fluctuation in the releasing hand could change the angle of release. Also associated with the angle of release, it was noticed that there was a little bounce in the swing of the pendulum due to a moment of freefall. Once the weight was supported by the string it snapped into the swing. This may have affected some of our results. Along with random errors we were able to identify a few systematic errors with our study as well. The first being the calibration of the stopwatch. We assumed that the stopwatch would work consistently every time we used it for each test. There was no stopping to ensure that the measurement device was consistently calibrated. Another factor we determined was the recorded masses on the plates used for the mass of the pendulum may not have weighed what was indicated on each plate. We did not weigh each plate when we added them to the pendulum. 
From the graphs of our three experiments we were clearly able to identify two distinct relationships that affected the period of the pendulum using the trendline on the graphs. The length of the string in EDP 1 and the angle of release in EDP 2. It was determined that the mass of the pendulum (EDP) had a negligible effect of the period of the pendulum. To further reduce our error of our experiments we decided to complete the experiment again using more precise measurement instruments. More precise measurements and better accountability on our controls gave us more evidence on our two remaining factors. 
For our second round of testing we tested the effect of different lengths of the string on the period of the pendulum first (EDP 4). To reduce error in our follow up experiment we used a photogate to record the period of the pendulum.  We also changed the angle of release from 90-degrees to 20-degrees and changed the mass of the pendulum to 50 grams. The length of string was increased by ten inches for each test. Each test at each length was completed more than once to reduce any error in our recorded times.
For EDP 5 we retested the angle of release and how it affects the period of the pendulum. For this retest we the set the length of the string at 15 inches and the mass of the pendulum at 50 grams. For this test like the previous, we used the photogate to determine the period of the pendulum. The angle of release was increased by 15-degrees for each test. Each test was completed more than once to reduce any error in our recorded times. The graph shows us that the relationship between the angle of release is not as strong as what we recorded in the length of string vs time test (EDP 4). The error bars on EDP 5 are very small and are hard to see.


The data collected, and the graphs show us that the strongest relationship between the three factors and period of the pendulum to be the length of string. The curve that best fit our graph in EDP 4 is  length of string vs time was the power line with equation is  $y=0.3681 x^{0.471}$. From our testing in this each of the five experiments we were able to identify variables that influence the period. It should be noted that when measuring anything by hand or visually that has a very small precise value there will always be some degree of human error needs to be accounted for. However, with our results we can clearly see that through two experiments and numerous tests in each experiment that the length of string has the largest effect on the period of the pendulum.
