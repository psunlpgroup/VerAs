discussion and conclusion

the research question being investigated is what impacts the period of the pendulum. three factors that were tested in this experiment are is  the weight, the angle of release and the length of the pendulum. the experiment with the mass as the independent variable and the period as the dependent variable showed no correlation with each other. the plotted data did not follow or come near the trendline. because of this, the r^2 value was less than 0.4, showing no correlation.  the experiment with the angle of release as the independent variable and the period as the dependent variable showed no correlation with each other.  according to the graph, the data fell in between the y-values of 1.5 seconds and 1.62 seconds. the difference is only 0.12 seconds. in addition, the error bars overlapped. even though the graph shows a positive correlation, there is none. the difference in time is caused by random error due to human timing. the experiment with the length of the pendulum as the independent variable and the period as the dependent variable showed direct positive correlation with each other. all the plotted points were on or very close to the trend line. in addition, the r^2 value was 0.9972.

the theoretical mathematical model for the length of the pendulum as the independent variable and the period of the pendulum as the dependent variable is is  			            $t=0.0135 l + 0.733$ with a r^2 value of 0.9972.  our group has confidence in these values because other groups obtained similar models. in addition, the points on the length versus period graph fall on or very close to the line. the models of the weight experiment is in accurate because it has a r^2 value less than 0.4 and the data points do not follow the line and the angle of release is inaccurate because only three data points were plotted on the graph. 

there are two possible sources of systematic errors. one is with the scale to measure weight. the scale could be improperly calibrated; this would lead to a one side error (systematic), either the weight measured is too heavy or too light. the second source is the photogate. like the scale, the photogate could be improperly calibrated. this leads to a one side error; ether the photogate stops too early, or too late. there were two possible random errors that occurred in the experiment. first, using a human to time the period of five swings. this is random because the timer could have stopped the timer before or after the pendulum completed five swings. to combat this, a photogate was introduced.  this significantly improved the timing of the pendulum and lead to more accurate results. the second source of random error is the angle of release. the protractor labels every one degree. if a person wanted the angle of release to be 60 degrees, he could have accidently set the angle of release to 59 or 61 degrees. to combat this, the protractor was placed in the same position every time and the same person measured the protractor to provide constant angle of releases. 

	there are a few constraints that limited the generalization of the experiment. not having an automatic dropper affected the way the pendulum swung. at time it would swing at an angle instead of perpendicular to the arm. in addition, having more lab time could have increased the amount of data we took. this would have increased the accuracy of our mathematical model.
