conclusion:
the purpose of our experimentation was to develop the mathematical models that describe the behavior of a real system as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model using controlled mass and magnetic forces. 

	in lab 05 we investigated the effects of applied force on acceleration. in our experimentation we kept the mass of the system constant, but alternated the total force acting on the hanging mass being first equal to then getting larger than the mass attached to the cart. keeping the mass as an independent variable and then taking data of the resulting acceleration, we were able to then plot the applied force that resulted from the hanging mass vs acceleration to get our mathematical model is  $y=2.7875 x - 0.0216$. the experimental model tested shows that there is a relationship between the force acting on a system and its acceleration when the system mass is kept constant.  this relationship is summed up in newton’s second law is   .  the positive slope found on the trendline accurately reflects the positive relationship between force and acceleration described by newton’s second law.

	in lab 06 we investigated the relationship between mass and the acceleration of the cart. the factors of both mass of the cart and the magnetic pull between each of its sides tested, with increasing values of the mass of the cart kept constant and taking data of the resulting accelerations. exploring the physical characteristics of the numerical values produced in our previous lab, our mathematical models represent the conclusion that as mass and the magnetic pull increase, the acceleration of the cart decreases, which represents the relationship in $f= m a$. graphing the change in mass vs the acceleration resulted in our mathematical model is   $y = -17.664 x  + 5.9847$. this model shows the relationship between mass and acceleration being inversely proportional, which is accurately represented by the negative slope. from our data, we can also conclude that external factors can affect each component of $f = m a$, such as friction and magnetic force, but the relationships between each variable stays constant.

above is the mathematical model presented by group 5 for lab 05. comparing their graph to ours we find that our results were very similar to theirs. with their model being $y = 2.8501 – 0.0124$, and ours being $y=2.7875 x - 0.0216$, this similarity is well supported by the closeness of our slope values. talking with group 5 and seeing on the board that other groups (1 and 2) were obtaining similar results for the slope values, we can support our experimental findings with the similar findings of our peers.

errors with our experimentation are possible to arise mainly from the effects of friction and air resistance. possible random errors include the air movement against our cart, since we were positioned close to the door the sudden gusts of wind from the hallway could have caused periods of increased air resistance, which would affect our data randomly with reading lower values of acceleration when a gust rushes in, and higher values when the gust pulls outwards. possible systematic errors include failing to pull the cart to the correct marked location of 300 mm and instead pulling short by 5 mm, which would cause the acceleration to be slightly less than the expected value for 300 mm, but since this is systematic it is unnoticeable to our results. factors that may impact the acceleration of a system include the friction experienced the pulley, the friction experienced by the air track cart, and the air resistance.  it would be extremely difficult to investigate friction and air resistance in our lab setting.  however, they could likely be better tested in a low gravity vacuum that would minimize the friction caused by gravity paired with normal force, and it would eliminate the effects of air resistance.

	if the investigation were repeated, one improvement to be made would be to lower the value of the masses used.  having a lower mass acting on the system would help to minimize the effects of friction and allow for a more accurate result.  in the experiment, it was assumed that the force of friction was negligible.  however, friction is always present in real-world experiments, and so it could potentially be measured in order to account for the lost acceleration in the final mathematical model.

	as regarded under the evaluation of our mathematical models, the effects of applied force on the acceleration investigated in lab 05 and the effects of mass on acceleration in lab 06 were both representative of newton’s second law, . regarding the first model, the positive slope indicates that as the applied force increases, the resulting acceleration also increases when mass is held constant. this accurately represents the direct relationship between force and acceleration that newton illustrates in his second law. regarding the second model, the negative slope indicates that as the mass of the system increases, the resulting acceleration decreases when the applied force is held constant. this accurately represents the indirect relationship between the mass and the acceleration that newton illustrates in his second law.
