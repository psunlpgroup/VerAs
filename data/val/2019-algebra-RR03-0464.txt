we were assigned to find out how much time, mass, and release angle affect the expected time of one period. for each experiment, we changed the independent variable in order to see the effect it had on time of the pendulum’s period. our prediction was that the length of the string would have an effect on the time of the pendulum's period. we can see that in graph 4 that there is a positive treadline in our data. with this graph, we calculated its linear regression and found an r-squared value of .9961 showing our data to be almost linear. this supports our prediction that when the length of the string is increased the amount of time in the period is also increased. the error bars in graph 1 show a small standard deviation thus showing our data to be comprehensive, validating the positive trend. graph 2, however, shows little to no correlation between the weight of the pendulum and the length of the period; there is no considerable trend shown between the plotted points. the error bars on this particular graph are the largest of all of the graphs. this means that there is the greatest standard deviation. graph 3 shows a positive trend between the angle of the release point and length of the period; there is a positive trend between the plotted points. this means that as the angle of release increases as does the period of the pendulum which goes along with our prediction. the error bars on this graph are also relatively big so the standard deviation would be relatively large itself.

the theoretical equation for the period of the pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ where t is time of pendulum swing, l is length of pendulum string, and g is the acceleration of gravity. the mathematical model produced in lab has a significantly lower coefficient than the theoretical model. i believe this is due to the human error and lack of accuracy while measuring the data points. although the theoretical doesn’t use a square root within its equation so that will have an effect on the coefficient. our model of $y=2.1269 x^{0.4111}$ would not produce the same as the theoretical model provided.

there are several errors that could potentially negatively affect the validity of our data. initially, we were concerned with using one stopwatch to time the length of the period. so, we initially used two stopwatches and found the mean time. eventually we used a motion sensed apparatus to time the length of the period. moreover, the length of the string could also present an issue. with simply our tape measure and eyes, it is difficult to measure out the exact needed length. a possible solution for this would be to have the string properly measured and cut so that the length becomes more exact.  another potential error was the release point angle. for every trial we measured to the release point wit a protractor just held up to the crane so it’s not likely that we measured the exact same angle for each trial. we possibly could have tried to secure the protractor to the crane with tape so that at least that was constant, but ideally with unlimited resources it would be best fitted to design an apparatus that would be able to hold the pendulum at the desired angle each trial with confidence that it would be consistent from time to time.

	a constraint of this experiment would be when we began the experiment with only a stopwatch to measure the time of each period. this lead to inaccurate measurements for the times. if we were to have began the experiment by using the motion sensor and computer program to measure time it would have been much more accurate and time efficient. this brings in the largest constraint that we had in this experiment which was time. since our class is only a certain amount of time long we were unable to run as many trials as we may have wanted to. with more runs and more accurate readings we could have had more accurate results.
