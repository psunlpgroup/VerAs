discussion and conclusion: 

	throughout this set of experiments the goal was to determine what factors affect the acceleration of a frictionless pully system. in lab 05 we first tested the force of applied to the system by moving masses from the cart to the hanging weight and determining how more weight that is hanging will affect the acceleration of the cart without changing the mass of the system. according to the graph of this independent variable, the more hanging weight we have the higher the acceleration gets. the graph is linear in this case, and the error bars are too small to be seen, the uncertainty is extremely low because the accuracy of our measuring devices. secondly for lab 05, we tested changing the mass of the system without changing the force and testing how it affects the acceleration. the graph shows that as mass is added to the system the acceleration gets slower. looking at data from other groups and comparing to our own looks similar. this supports our data and appears to be correct in our claims. in lab 06 we tested the tilt of the track and how the higher the tilt in the direction that the cart is traveling affects the acceleration of the cart. we found that as the tilt is increased the acceleration of the system increases as well.  the error bars in each of these graphs are too small to be seen because of the accuracy of the equipment and limiting the error in our recording. our results were supported by the findings of other groups as seen above. the other group that did the same independent variable got similar results and came to the same conclusion as us. 



	we used two different theoretical equations through these experiments. the first is simply $f=ma$. newtons second law applies here because it is a frictionless system that is being acted on by only one mass which is that which is being pulled down by the acceleration of gravity. for the second part of the lab we had to consider the force and the tilt affecting the acceleration of the cart. we were able to use the equation   in order to model the acceleration of this. 



	in the scenario where a heavy string is being used to connect the hanging weight and the cart because the heavy string will cause more friction rather than a said to be frictionless string will cause the acceleration of the cart to decrease. this is due to the friction between the pulley and the string that causes the cart to face resistance that did was not an issue prior. 

	errors will occur in any experiment because we are unable to create an environment where everything is perfect. these things we are unable to avoid is friction, although we can minimize the friction that exists, there is still some that will always be there. measuring errors are also something that can be minimized by extremely precise measuring tools however there will always be a level of uncertainty that comes with any measuring tool, even if it is almost negligible. considering data points that are useless to the data is also an error that could be made. in order to minimize our error, we only considered data points that were critical and left out those where the cart was not moving or had stopped and changed direction. we also limited our rounding to get the most accurate numbers we could find. 

	from these results we concluded that force applied, and tilting the track have a liner correlation to the acceleration of the cart. we also concluded that adding mass to the system created a power relation to the acceleration, as more mass was added the acceleration was decreased dramatically. measuring tools and an ideal experiment environment could minimize or even eliminate error in our experiment.
