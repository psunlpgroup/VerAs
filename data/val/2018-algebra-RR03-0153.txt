conclusion/discussion

from observation, the length of the string displayed a correlation between length of string and time. the longer the length of the string, the longer the period of the pendulum. 

	the experiment overall gave insight on the impacts of the variables, which include angle of release, mass of pendulum, and length of string, on the period of the pendulum in a small swing. our group was able to complete the experiment over three weeks of testing, creating data and graphs, as well as analyzing the data. the research question we intended to answer was “what variables impact the period of a pendulum in a small swing?” our first variable tested was the angle of release as the independent variable while keeping the mass of pendulum and length of string constant. after five trials were completed and graphs were produced, it displayed that there was no clear relationship between the angle and period length. the second variable tested was the mass of the pendulum as the independent variable while the length of the string and angle of release were kept constant. after five trials were ran and graphs were constructed, it displayed no clear connection between the mass and period length. finally, our last variable tested was the length of string as the independent variable while keeping the mass of the pendulum and angle of release constant. after fiver trials with graphs created based on the data results, it displayed a non-linear line which indicated a relationship with the period of the pendulum. a further look was taken into the length of the string impact. the theoretical model used was $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. the mathematical model of the length graph was represented by the equation $y=1.5788 x^{0.4039}$, where “y” is the time of the period in seconds and “x” is the length of the string in centimeters. this was determined by plotting the graph using excel and using the line of best fit feature to derive the equation. this is a strong model for the relationship as the trendline closely relates to the theoretical equation as length is raised to the .5 power, and the constant is approximately 2. this is a close match for the theoretical equation. based off of the theoretical model, a length of 0.5 m would produce a period of 1.419 seconds. our closest experimental value is 0.52 m which produced a value of 1.541 seconds. given that 0.52 m is slightly greater than 0.5 m and produced a period slightly greater than the theoretical value for 0.5, our model and theoretical equation produced similar values. based off of the experimental model, the length of the string must be 17.35 meters in order for the period to be 5 seconds. based on our previous data, the mass has no impact on the period of the pendulum. random errors that may have occurred are incorrect string measurement and the timing of the stopwatch. systematic errors that may have occurred are the scale being incorrect and the protractor angle being off. random errors were and can be reduced by using better technique when performing tasks such as using the stopwatch. practice may also help reduce random error. systematic error can be reduced or stopped by using better equipment that works correctly such as purchasing a new stopwatch that does not malfunction. error bars help with understanding and viewing any trends in the graphs, but the angle and mass graph showed no correlation. the length of the string graph does hold a trend. future experiments of the period of the pendulum could be to test it with a larger sized pendulum and more advanced equipment to acquire the most accurate results.
