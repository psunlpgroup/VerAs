discussion and conclusion

the reason our group conducted this lab was to investigate if the applied force on a system affects the acceleration of the system. during this experiment the pulley-cart system was placed on an track of air with strings and bobbers attached. by changing where the bobbers were, either hanging or on the physical cart, we could find the relationship between mass and acceleration. by looking at tables 1 and graph 1, we see that they produce a linear relationship. the mathematical model is newton’s second law, $f = m a$.  further, our data in tables 3-5 and graphs 3-5 backup our findings. our experimental models for those graphs were $y = 18.146 x -0.0334$, $4y = 18.202 x - 0.0264$, and $y = 18.729 x - 0.0211$. this shows that when a larger force is applied, the larger the acceleration of the system.

as mentioned before, the theoretical model in this lab is newton’s second law, $f = m a$. referring to graphs 1, 3, 4, and 5, every equation from the graph is in slope intercept form, $y = m x + b$. the x value is found by dividing one by the mass of the system and the b is from the force of friction and air resistance. the m is the slope of the graph, so therefore it is the force applied to make the cart accelerate. all this comes together and creates newton’s second law.



unfortunately, group 2 measured the number of bobs instead of measuring the mass of each bob, so the data compared to ours is completely different. compared to our data they said the number of magnets will make the acceleration of the system smaller, while our group stated the exact opposite. regardless, their model still somewhat represents newton’s second law and a linear relationship between mass vs. acceleration. group 3 had similar results to us. their b values in $y =m x + b$ is all negative like ours. however, their b values changed quite drastically unlike ours, and that probably happened because they were told to increase the height of their experiment. in the end, their mathematical model still represents newton’s second law like ours and the other groups in our lab.

although our lab group did not run into too many systematic or random errors in these experiments, there was still plenty of room for them. first and foremost, the force sensor could have been faulty, and the triple bean balance only goes to the tenth value and needs to be calibrated before each lab is started. although our data trends towards the right way, there is still a slight chance that some of our calculated masses for each bobber and the cart are off due to random error and humans not being perfect. 

as always, a constraint in this lab was time. in only a two-hour long period, there are only so many trials a group can perform to get accurate and concise data. if we were given more time, we could have conducted more trials and therefore decreased the error in the lab. another constraint could have been the equipment given. if we were given a balance that measures out to a farther decimal, then our mass measurements would have been more accurate in our data.

our two mathematical models are consistent with newton’s second law, , by the linear relationships that tables 1, 3, 4, 5, and graphs 1, 3, 4, 5 produce. because the data represented from the tables and graphs mentioned above give us an equation that is easy to understand and calculate the force, acceleration, and mass of a system in the experiment we conducted. newton’s second law is a direct relationship. therefore, when you increase the mass of the system, the acceleration goes up and vice versa. in addition, when you increase the applied force of the system, the acceleration of the system must increase as well.
