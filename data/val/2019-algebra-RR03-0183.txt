discussion and conclusion 

the purpose of this experiment was to determine what factors impact the period of a pendulum swing. 

table 1 shows the testing of the impact of length on the period of a pendulum swing. the mass was kept constant at 250g and the angle was kept constant at 45 degrees. the length of the string was changed each period swing with values of 100 cm, 80 cm, 60 cm, 40 cm, and 20 cm. the results of this data was then graphed, shown in figure 1, and it was determined that there was a non-linear relationship between length and time. because of these results, a second experiment was done using length versus time. a photogate was used to record the time it took the pendulum to complete one period swing. table 4 shows that mass was kept the same at 230 g and the angle was kept the same at 15 degrees. the length of the string was changed using values of 175 cm, 155 cm, 135 cm, 95 cm, 55 cm, 35 cm, and 15 cm. from these results we were able to determine a mathematical and theoretical equation shown in figure 4. table 2 shows the impact of angle of release on the period of a pendulum swing. the mass was kept constant at 250g and the length was kept constant at 60 cm. the angles of release varied from 30 degrees, 25 degrees, 20 degrees, 15 degrees, and 10 degrees. figure 2 shows that the relationship between angle of release and time it takes to complete one period swing is linear. this data determined that the angle of release has no impact on the period of a pendulum. table 3 shows the testing of the impact of mass on the period of a pendulum swing. the angle of release was kept constant at 45 degrees and the length of the string was kept constant at 60 cm. the mass on the string was varied from 250g, 210 g, 170g, 130g, and 90g. figure 3 shows that the relationship between the mass on the pendulum and the time it takes to complete one period has a linear relationship. this data determined that mass has no significant effect on the period of a pendulum swing. 

the theoretical model was determined using figure 4. this data came from testing the impact of the string length on the period of a pendulum swing. the theoretical model is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. our data of time can be used as t and our data of length can be used as l. each time data for length is plugged into this model for time, there are different intervals of time. if the data of mass was used to determine a theoretical equation, there would not be much of a change. values of mass would be plugged in and values of time was stay nearly the same due to the linear nature of the graph. the same results would occur the same techniques were used for angle. 

errors that could have occurred during this experiment were reaction time when using a stop watch. another error that could have occurred was determining one period of the pendulum and if this was kept the same during each test. a possible error that could have occurred in the class room would be a gust of wind that would speed up the swing of the pendulum. the factor of error with reaction time was reduced by using a photogate. the photogate had an uncertainty of 0.001 second. the factor of wind in the classroom could be avoided by making sure the classroom door was shut and all windows are sealed.

constraints in the experiments could be due to the fact that the longest length of the pendulum that was tested was 175 cm so our mathematical model is only generalizable to pendulum lengths no longer than 175 cm. the same constraints apply with mass and angle.
