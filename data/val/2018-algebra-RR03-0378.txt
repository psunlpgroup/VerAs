conclusion

the research question for this experiment was “what variables impact the period of the pendulum for small swings?” from the data, we can conclude that the angle of release and the weight of the bob did not have an affect on the period of the pendulum. according to table 5 and figure 2, there is no correlation between the weight of the bob and the period of the pendulum, as the slope is nearly zero. the error bars for all points overlap with each other. this leads to a rejection of the hypothesis and an unacceptance of the prediction found in table 2. according to table 6 and figure 3, there is no correlation between the angle of release and the period of the pendulum. the error bars for all points overlap with each other. this leads to a rejection of hypothesis and an unacceptance of the prediction found in table 3. the length of the string did have an affect on the period of the pendulum. according to table 4 and figure 1, there is a positive correlation between the length of the string and the period of the pendulum. as the length of the string increased, the period of the pendulum increased as well. the error bars do not overlap. this leads to a failure to reject the hypothesis and an acceptance of the prediction found in table 1. 

the equation for the period of a pendulum is . this equation can be supported by the data as it states that the time taken for a pendulum to swing for a full period is equal to two pi times the square root of the length of the pendulum over gravity. since gravity is a constant number at 9.8m/, then the only factor that can affect the period, is l for length. this is demonstrated by our results. 

random error was in the methods used to measure the variables, for example rounding from the stopwatch. these rounding errors where accounted for by adding error bars to the graphs or .001. these error bars were so small, that they cannot be seen on the graph. systematic errors were also included in the experiments. during the first two labs, a stopwatch was used to measure the periods, which was affected by slow reflex. to get the best data, multiple trials where run, and the average was taken for the final data. it is also important to note that there was some slight systematic error in the preciseness of calibration when measuring the length of the string and angle of release. these errors could be improved upon in the future by using more precise methods of measurement, such as using more advanced technology or software.
