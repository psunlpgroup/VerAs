conclusion:
	to restate, the goal of this lab was to see what aspects of a pendulum affect its period length. in experiment one we tested the effects of each variable by keeping two of the variables constant and altering the value of the third so that we could see how, if it all, the period changed. after this experiment we were able to safely conclude that mass had no effect, however our graphs, seen above, led us to believe that both angle of release and length did affect period length. in experiment two we calculated standard deviation so that we could check how both random and systematic error could have affected our data and while conducting this experiment we were able to discover that angle of release should have no effect on period length. for the third experiment we tested period length in relation to length of the string. in order to guarantee the best results possible, we also used a photogate to get a more accurate time measurement. by the end of the third lab we were able to safely conclude that length is the only variable that has an impact on period length seeing as the graph above displays a direct power function. 

	the true theoretical formula for period length is found by $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. our equation was 0.2886 * l0.4322. our coefficient is different, also the true equation takes the force of gravity into consideration. however, both equations feature the length raised to a power that is less than one. the theoretical model also confirms our assessment that mass and angle of release have no impact on period length as they are not present within the equation. 

in terms of errors that were present in these experiments, one random error is that in order to calculate the period of the swing we had to use a stop watch and eyeball when it reached the end of its swing, which likely led to calculated times that were off by a few milliseconds. another random error was that it was hard to keep the string steady on the correct angle of release after we measured the angle. a systematic error was if we released the mass at an angle so that it wasnâ€™t moving in a perfectly straight line. to reduce the error caused by the stopwatch we decided to have more people time the pendulum and then we took the average of those values. we fixed the problem of an inaccurate angle by having one person ensure and accurate measurement right before we dropped the mass. we also made sure to keep the string taught at the time of release to decrease the chance of the string swinging at an angle.

most of the constraints had to do with either the accuracy of our tools, or the environment where we were testing. our tools, while they were accurate enough for us to see whether a variable had a correlation to period length, were not able to give us accurate enough answers for a proper general formula. also, since we were executing these experiments in a classroom we had to work with outside forces, like air resistance, interfering with our pendulum.
