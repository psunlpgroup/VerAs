conclusion:
Based on this Data we determined that the length of the string was the only variable that truly showed a correlation with the period of the pendulum. Now for the mass and angle, the correlation between the them couldn’t be determined because the values fluctuated and didn’t have a good R value when plugged into a graph. Thus, we can conclude that when the length of the string increases the period of the string increases. With that being said, we then went further to truly see the relationship between the string and the period of the pendulum. We then conducted another experiment to show this relationship. The new question for this experiment was how does the length (cm) effect the period of a pendulum? Hence, our independent variable for this experiment was the length of the string. The Dependent variable is the period(s) of the pendulum. The control variables were the mass (90g), angle (10 degrees) , and how many swings. The hypothesis for this experiment is As the string increases in length, the time of the pendulum will also increase. Then we predicted that The time of the period will increase as the string gets longer. The equipment for this experiment are the same as before except instead of a stop watch we will use a photogate that only has a .001 percent error. 

There are error bars for this graph they are just very small. However, to restate, the research question for part 2 of the experiment was how the length effect the period of the pendulum.  To find this answer we took 5 trials at 5 different lengths to find what the period was. We determined that the values were correct because the range of uncertainty was .001 and all our values fell within the range. Then when we plugged the data in and ran graph to find the relationship between the IV and DV. At first we believed that the relationship was linear, but then we learned the R^2 determines how closely the IV and DV correlate to each other, we then found out that the power format was the most logical relationship pattern because the R^2 value is exactly at one which is a perfect correlation. Once that was determined, we used the slope of the line equation to show the true relationship which was $Y= 0.1902 x^{0.5099}$. We used this equation to determine what variables were in the equation. We were given a theoretical model for the relationship for the length of string and period which was $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. We than put a predicted length of 5cm into the theoretical model and our slope equation. Using the theoretical mathematical model would be 1.419 seconds. Based on our data the Period would be 1.399 so the numbers are similar showing that this is the true relationship between the IV and DV. The errors seen in this experiment were mostly random errors this is because all of our data was collected by using measuring tools that require the person measuring to conclude the final measurement. To reduce these errors all you would have to do Is take more measurements and find an average because most of the measurements are likely to fall within the true value of the measurement.
