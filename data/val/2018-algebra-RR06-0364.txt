discussion and conclusion-

in this lab, we investigated how the acceleration of a system will change when the applied force changes. in order to determine how the acceleration would change we attached five bobbers to a cart that was on a frictionless track. for each trial, one bobber was taken off of the cart and added to a string hanging over a pulley in order to increase the applied force on the system starting with four bobbers on the cart and one on the string. although the location of the bobbers changed throughout the trials the total mass of the system remained the same. this allowed us to make the force of the hanging weight our independent variable and manipulate it in order to investigate whether or not it affected acceleration. our data table 1 and figure 1 displayed a positive linear relationship between the force on a system and its acceleration, which led us to conclude that as force on a system increases so will its acceleration. although there were error bars present in figure 1, they did not affect the relationship between force and acceleration.

	our data was compared to two other groupsâ€™ data as seen below is  

in both other groups a positive relationship was displayed between the force of the hanging and the acceleration of the cart which supports our findings that increasing the force will increase acceleration. although the relationship between force and acceleration was the same for our lab groups, our experimental models differed. our group produced an experimental model of $y=0.1919 x+2e^{-5}$ while the other groups had models of $y=4.486 x+0.023$ and $y=5.36 x-0.0436$ respectively. the difference between our models was caused by our group forgetting to convert grams to kilograms when calculating the force on the system (mass of the system x gravity). 

	a theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m}$ of the system was produced for the acceleration of the system by a single force. this model matched our experimental model of $y=0.1919 x+2e^{-5}$ where .1919x represents acceleration and the y-intercept represents the force of friction as it produced an r^2 value of .99 when it was fitted to our data as shown in figure 1. additionally, an enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of the system by more than one force was produced. our initial theoretical equation was $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ but we assumed that the cart on the track and the string on the pulley were frictionless and therefore there were no outside forces acting on the system. this changed our theoretical model to $a=\frac{f}{m}$ of the system, which we used to predict the amount of hanging mass needed for an acceleration of .6 m/s^2. using this equation and a given acceleration we were able to calculate the hanging mass. after the mass was calculated another trial was run in order to verify that our calculation was corrected. our experimental model from this trial was $y=0.59x -0.322$ (+/- 6.1e-4). this supported our theoretical model because both were accurately able to predict the hanging mass when given the acceleration value of .6 m/s^2. 

we also considered a scenario where there would be a heavy string connecting the hanging mass to the cart and how that would affect its acceleration. we determined that if the string was massive the acceleration would increase exponentially rather than linearly because as the string moved down the pulley the force acting on the cart would increase from both gravity acting on the sting and bobber rather than just the bobbers in the initial set up. 

error incurred in this lab was mostly random such as knots in the string running over the pulley causing a frictional force or an air track not being completely frictionless as they were assumed to be. sources of systematic error could come from the balance not being calibrated correctly resulting in mass measurements being consistently too high or low. 

although we believe we collected accurate data and drew an accurate conclusion about the relationship between force on a system and its acceleration we may have not run enough trials to completely generalize this relationship. additionally, we only tested a gravitational force on the cart and did not investigate whether other types of applied force had the same effect on acceleration.
