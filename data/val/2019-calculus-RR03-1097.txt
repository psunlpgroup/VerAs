conclusion:

     the point of this lab was to see what affected the period of the pendulum between mass attached to the end of the arm, the length of the arm, and the angle the arm was being released from. a test was conducted for each of these factors and based off of our data, only length affects the period of a pendulum. conducting the first experiment with mass, different masses were used with length and angle being held constant. the table and the graph represent a relatively straight line with no slope. with this, we can make the conclusion that mass and period have no relation with each other. the next test done was with angle. looking at the table and graph after the experiment was done, it can be shown that there is also a relatively straight line with no slope. with this we can make a conclusion that the angle doesn’t affect the period of a pendulum. the last experiment done was with the length. looking at the table and graph after the experiment, a relatively straight line with a positive slope was found. with this we can conclude that the arm length of the pendulum does affect the period. it was thought that the relationship between the length and period of a pendulum were linear but after more accurate data was taken, it was found that a power model better fit the curve of the graph. this gave an r^2 value of .9931 and a power equation of 2.0869x^.3878. the theoretical equation found was $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$. our model fits the coefficient well because when the formula is reconfigured, the coefficient for the theoretical equation was about 2.007 which is very close to the 2.0869 we found. gravity is included into the original model but since it is always the same, it is included into the coefficient. the exponent was a little bit off but still came close. the theoretical yield found should have been about l^.5 but we came up with l^.38. gravity was a factor that would have changed our answer, but it is always constant, so it is generally not put into consideration. 

     there are multiple errors that happened during the experiments. systematic errors included the mass not being exactly what was stated, the scale not being able to be zeroed properly, and stopwatches having different time intervals. these errors could have been reduced in many ways. the mass could have been weighed to see if the value matched the amount stated, the scale was fixed to be properly zeroed or maybe zeroed to a consistent starting measurement and using the same stopwatch, so the same time interval was used. the random errors included stopwatch reaction time, inconsistency in the angle measurement of release at each test, the string length slowly lengthening after each test because the clamp wasn’t tight enough, the initial velocity of the pendulum wasn’t the same every time, and the string wasn’t measured correctly. these errors could have been reduced in many ways such as the string length being measured to a small degree and it being checked after every test to make sure it hasn’t slipped, having a device that would be able to more successfully release the pendulum at a consistent angle and velocity every time, finding the average period over a group of oscillations instead of finding the period for each swing with the assumption that the harmonic effect wouldn’t affect the data in the first few oscillations. the constraints of this lab include the same gravity as that on earth (-9.8 m/s^2) and relatively little to no air resistance.
