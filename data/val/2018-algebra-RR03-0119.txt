discussion and conclusion

	throughout all three labs, the research question remained constant: what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? amongst our group, we came up with three possible factors that may affect the period is  the length of the string attached to the weight, the mass of the weight, and the angle at which the pendulum was released. to see if any of the factors affected the period, three experiments were conducted with one factor being changed throughout each experiment to determine whether it affected the period or not. according to the graphs, the only one that seemed to not have the final error values cross each other and have a positive slope was the graph from experiment two, where the length of the string was changed. the mathematical equation for the period of a pendulum is 2 π* √(length of string/9.81), fits the claim. if one were to look at experiment 2’s graph and the lab 3’s “pendulum vs. time” graph’s best fit curves, a positive correlation between the time and length of string can be seen. as the length of the string increases, so does the time for a full oscillation to complete. the model also helps to prove the accuracy of experiment 1 (mass was changed) and experiment 3 (where the angle was changed), whereas it appeared that neither factor affected the period. however, the graphs are not 100% accurate due to a few random errors such as the fact a stopwatch was used to record the oscillations. it was difficult to obtain extremely accurate data, therefore we used photogate to get a more accurate measurement of the time it took for a full oscillation to complete.
