discussion: 

	we spent the last two labs investigating the question “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?” this was answered by setting up an experiment where the mass of the hanging part of the system changed and each acceleration was recorded. our experiment was set up based on our hypothesis, as the lower system’s mass increases, the acceleration will increase, and allowed us to define the weight of the hanging mass as our independent variable and the acceleration our dependent variable. we started with 6 bobbers on the cart and one hanging; two trials were taken, and the velocities were recorded; one bobber or around 4.75g was moved from the cart to the hanging mass; another two trials were taken, and the accelerations were recorded; this was repeated until there were no bobbers on the cart. the graph of the average accelerations is presented above and labeled figure 2. there are error bars, but our error was so small that they are not visible on the graph. the conclusion that can be made from our graph would be that as the weight of the hanging mass increases, the acceleration will increase as well. we can make this conclusion from our theoretical model which is defined as $f=m a$ . the slope of the graph (5.0872) is calculated from 1/m when m is defined as mass. we have a b value of .0019 which represents the error that could be present in the experiment. some of this error could include; systematic error from the scale being inaccurate, data studio inaccuracies, and friction from the air track. if the string had mass, as the system moved there could be increasing mass on the lower force. this means that the acceleration of the system would be increasing ever so slightly as it moved. the presence of this value also tells us that there are other force factors acting on the system. these could be friction or air resistance. there may have been a small amount of error but there weren’t many constraints that kept us from getting accurate data. the constraints present would be in the cart, maybe it didn’t sit on the track evenly; scale, maybe it was less accurate because it wasn’t digital; and string, because there was a knot in it; but were so small that only a very small amount of error is present. all our data can be represented by a theoretical and mathematical model. a more advanced theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ 

was then analyzed. i think this is more accurate because it is looking at the individual masses in the system rather than the mass in general affecting the acceleration. i think both theoretical models are related to our mathematical model $a=c f+c’$. c’ is defined as 0 and c is defined as 1/m. this gives us another reason to say that our data supports our hypothesis as the lower system’s mass increases, the acceleration will increase. 


after completing our experiment, we were able to look at the data of the other groups. based on their data above, figure 3 and 4, we all had the similar hypotheses. in group 1 data, they ended up with a slope of .0053-.0306 based on their theoretical model $f=m a$. their slope is a lot smaller because we converted our masses to kilograms and their masses are in grams. they had similar results as us. you can tell because the data gave them a positive slope with little error. their error could be from things like systematic error from the scale being inaccurate, data studio inaccuracies, and friction from the air track as well. group 3 ended up with a slope of .005- .0338 based on their theoretical model $f= m a$ . we were all similar in the fact that we had the same theoretical model. their slope, again, is a lot smaller because we converted our masses to kilograms and their masses are in grams. group 3 data is very similar to group 1 which increases the credibility of the experiment because it can be repeated with similar results. this helps support all our claims because knowing more than one group with similar hypotheses get the same results, the results are more accurate. the more trials of an experiment the more accurate.
