conclusion

	the objective for this experiment was to determine what variables would affect the length of a pendulum’s period. in consideration of how the experiment was to be conducted, three independent variables were chosen, the mass of the pendulum, the starting angle where the pendulum was to be released, and the length of string attached to the pendulum. it was predicted that the mass of the pendulum and the starting angle would not influence the length of each respected period but the length of the string would. 

each independent variable was tested with the other two state variables chosen as constants to keep testing conditions as consistent as possible. a constant value for each variable was chosen and kept the same when one of the three variables were being tested. each independent variable was tested once by hand and it was determined by the graphs that the hypothesis could not be rejected. as seen in figures 4 and 5, there are no obvious trends in the data which denote that the regardless of how each variable changed (mass of the pendulum or starting angle), the period would not change if the length of the string stayed consistent. as seen by figure 1, the graph of the length of string vs period, an obvious power curve was observed since a line could not be drawn through the error bars. the power curve of that experiment is displayed on figure 2 which also shows a very high r^2 value which denotes high accuracy with the actual data. since the claim that the length of string would change the pendulum’s period could not be rejected, the experiment was performed again on a photogate and the results are displayed on figure 3. as shown on the graph, the curve does not display an obvious power curve but more of a linear curve (which is not displayed on the figure 3) which is an interesting anomaly considering that the photogate is usually more accurate than testing by hand. in observation of other groups, the graph obtained by the first experiment done by hand was the most consistent with other results. 

as discussed below each set of experiments, there were errors that could have caused the measurements to have been skewed. in all the experiments done by hand, random error would have played a factor since our group only let the pendulum swing once before being caught by hand. the reaction time of the catcher varies with each swing so it is not unreasonable to consider that each result could have been slightly inconsistent with the others. the reaction time of the person with the stop watch also played in as a random error and with the combination of the two variant reaction times and the fact that two people cannot perfectly sync together to perform an action at the same time and verbalize it, it potentially increased the factor of error within the results. one way to remedy this problem was to let the pendulum swing four or five times before catching it instead of once. in theory this would not have been a good idea because the pendulum would never return to this same spot but in practice that difference is negligible so letting the bob swing a few times and taking the average would not impede with the accuracy as long as it gets to swing the same number if times in each trial. another error that was found was that since the difference in length of string of the photogate experiment was too little, the curve that was derived did not accurately display the power curve that would have been consistent with the other groups’ results. this is a systematic error and can be remedied by increasing the difference between each measured length of string. there is also a possibility that the photogate could have been poorly calibrated which would be a systematic error and could only be remedied by finding the factor of error and adding it or subtracting it from each data point.

this lab’s results can only be truly representative of the conditions that were provided in that physical lab with the other control variables. for example, the material of the components could have been tested with varying sizes and density and even the amount of gravity present with this experiment being conducted on earth. all these variables could have an effect on the outcome and limit how general our results can be.
