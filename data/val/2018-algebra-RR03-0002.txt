Discussion and Conclusion:

In this experiment, not only was the factor that affects the period of a pendulum determined but was compared to the theoretical mathematical model to analyze error. During the first week, the three factors chosen were mass, length of the string, and angle of release and they were each tested to determine whether or not they affected the period time of a pendulum. This data was graphed and during the second week, the standard deviation and error bars were determined and added to these graphs. The data collected from the mass shows that there is a slight increase in the period of the pendulum as the mass increases, but the slope is not significant enough to indicate any relationship between mass and a pendulum’s period (Figure 1). This conclusion is supported by the fact that the error bars in the graph do overlap, indicating that the data is dependent of one another and that there is no significant relationship between mass and period time. The overlapping error bars are also an indication that the increased slope could be due to a lack of precision and a presence of many errors. When analyzing the effect of the angle of release to the period of a pendulum, the graph shows little to no increasing or decreasing slope, so it can be said that the angle of release shows no effect on the period of a pendulum. This is supported by the error bars overlapping in the graph (Figure 2), meaning that there is a dependency of the data and that there is not a significant enough change to conclude that there is a relationship between the angle of release and the period time. However, the graph that shows the relationship of length of the string and the period times shows a significant increase and it can be concluded that as the length of the string on a pendulum increases, the period time increases. This is supported by the error bars that do not overlap one another, showing that the data was precise enough to mathematically support a relationship between the two. 

After determining and finding enough support to conclude that there is a direct, increasing relationship between the length of the string on a pendulum and the period time, the mathematical mode and theoretical mathematical mode were compared. Using the equation $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, the theoretical equation was determined to be $y=0.201 x^{0.5}$ Using Microsoft Excel, the power fit line was determined and then the mathematical mode equation for our experiment was determined. This equation turned out to be $y=0.2727 x^{0.5}$, which is comparable to the theoretical equation. The equations are comparable until the tenths place (or +/- 0.1) and it can be said that the experimental equation supports the theoretical mathematical model.

There was a plethora of random and systematic errors within this experiment. An example of the systematic errors present is the uncertainty in the photogage (which is 0.001), uncertainty in the phone timers, and uncertainty in the measuring devices such as the ruler and the tape measure used to determine the length of the string. The number of trials done would have slightly decreased this error. These are hard to fix because these uncertainties cannot be changed or reduced, however, the random error associated with these tools can be reduced greatly. When handling these tools, only one person should consecutively measure each item to decrease the estimating of measurements. During the experiment, the method of trials and determining the average were different and to reduce error, the experiment should have remained consistent throughout. For example, when measuring the period with various masses, the pendulum was released and let go three times for each mass difference, which not only increases random error but is different from how the rest of the experiment was executed. By timing ten oscillations, we’re reducing the random error caused by human relapse time and miscoordination. However, this increases the amount of systematic error. Due to random error of slanted release angles and relapse, the oscillations may vary from one another and also decrease over time due to the acceleration of gravity pull downward on the pendulum.
