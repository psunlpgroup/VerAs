conclusion:

our motivation for this lab was to discover how newtons second law can be utilized for items to discover the increasing speed of articles. for the two labs 005 and 006 our examination point was $f=m a$. lab 005 was over the how to mass of the balancing object on the cart impacts the acceleration of the cart. lab 006 was over how the edge of tendency on the track will influence the speeding up of the truck while changing the draping mass like in investigation 005.our research question for lab 005 was the manner by which do the mass of the hanging object impact the increasing speed of the cart, while in lab 006 our examination question was the way does the quickening of the vehicle change with various edges of tendency.
 our three tests prompted the models by gathering the information through the pc programming and charting it on excel. utilizing the excel we could locate the scientific conditions for every one of the charts. the variable of weight changes the speeding up of the cart the best. being a frictionless surface, the truck expecting to go up at a more extreme point doesn't influence the increasing speed so much contrasted with the hanging mass. despite the fact that the conditions and charts bode well, the diagrams are distinctive in light of the fact that one is contrarily related and the other is straight. this is because of when you change the condition $f=m a$ around, that changes the manner in which the diagram looks. our cases for the charts were right when taking a gander at our experimental design templates. this can be seen by the diagrams and the information caught from the product.
in lab 005 there was one systematic error that we found could be available amid the examination. our tracks are made to indicate insignificant grinding all through the test, anyway the tracks are not flawless and can't really play out the trial splendidly. this mistake in the examination is a systematic error since this mistake can be found in each trial performed. in lab 006 there was a critical tilt to the track that caused issues at an early stage with attempting to make the track superbly straight. we attempted to change this by utilizing a dimension and adjusting the track to end up flawlessly level to stay away from inconveniences in the issue. all together for the test to lead deliberate more preliminaries will make progressively precise information.
the track angle of inclination was increased and decreased at small increments. for our tilts we used 1/3rd inch, 46/100th of an inch, and 79/100th of an inch. our data was still relatively accurate and could work on larger scale projects as well.
for every model we tested to find what could possible happen when you change mass of an object or force of the object or the acceleration of the object. our group did find that when you increase the force it also increases the acceleration of the system. this can be found to be correct when you keep the other variable in the system constant. newtons 2nd law show value because when the forces are put in into $f=m a$ properly you will find relatively similar accelerations to what our data that we found on excel to be.

the equations for the graphs make sense because our data corresponds with known formulas. just because one graph is different however doesn’t mean that it isn’t correct. the first graph is actually inversed so it looks different from “normal” graphs.

linear  $a = \frac{f}{m}$ this is just like the graph of ($y=x$) since you are dividing by a constant number/variable it doesn’t cause the change of the graph to be exponential. for the inverse graph is  $a =\frac{f}{m}$  the mass of mc increases which in turn makes the fraction smaller causing the acceleration to decrease.
