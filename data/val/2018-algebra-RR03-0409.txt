discussion and conclusion:

	the purpose of this lab was to determine what exactly impacts the period of the small swing of a pendulum. specifically, the mass of the weight on the string, the angle of release, and the length of the string were the independent variables involved while the dependent variable was the period of the small swing of the pendulum. in this experiment, error bars and equivalency criterion were considered in conjunction to determine if the specific independent variable did or did not impact the period of the pendulum. error bars were created for each graph based on the 95% confidence level in microsoft excel which considers two standard deviations. if the error bars were to overlap, then the independent variable likely did not affect the period of the small swing of the pendulum, while if the error bars did not overlap then it did likely impact the period of the pendulum.

	when considering the mass of the weight on the string, it is likely that this independent variable does not affect the period of the small swing of the pendulum. the data displayed in table 4 showed that the period of the pendulum was relatively consistent; the error bars displayed in figure 1 were used to justify the fact that there truly was no relationship between the independent and dependent variables. the error of uncertainty for the mass of the weight on the string was 0.014832 (table 4) which is the length of the error bar above the point while 0.014832 (table 4) would be the length of the error bar below the data point as well. when comparing all data points in figure 1, the error bars overlapped which displayed that the mass of the weight on the string did not impact the period of the small swing of the pendulum. 

	the next independent variable observed was the angle of release which also did not impact the period of the small swing of the pendulum. based on table 5, the data shows that the period of the pendulum is relatively consistent; however, the only way to ensure that there was no effect on the period of the pendulum was to look at the error bars displayed in figure 2. the error of uncertainty for the mass of the weight on the string was 0.038987 (table 5) which again was the length of the error bar above the point, while 0.038987 (table 5) was the length of the error bar below the data point as well. the error bars shown in figure 2 displayed an overlap between the data points which verified that angle of release did not impact the period of the small swing of the pendulum.

	the last independent variable observed was the length of the string which, based on table 6, did seem to impact the period of the small swing of the pendulum. however, when generating figure 3, the error bars seemed to be overlapping which would have implied no relationship between the independent and dependent variables. the error of uncertainty was 0.533695 which was the length of the error bar both above and below the data point. there seemed to be an inconsistency between what the data in table 6 was showing and the graphed data in figure 3. for that reason, a new experiment was conducted in which ten trials were completed where the mass of the weight, angle of release, and length of the string were controlled variables. the purpose of conducting ten trials with just this experimental design was to help minimize the random error involved. the data displayed in table 7 along with the graph with error bars shown in figure 4 have much more consistent period values with all three variables being held constant, thus showing that the error of uncertainty, 0.028848 (table 7), of the pendulum apparatus and the length of string measurements could be minimized. in effort of understanding if the length of the string did truly affect the period of the small swing of the pendulum, an experiment was conducted involving the photogate to further minimize error of uncertainty to 0.001 (table 8). the data was then graphed with the error bars, as displayed in figure 5. in this graph, the error bars were not overlapping, which effectively displayed that the length of the string did affect the period of the small swing of the pendulum. 

	when generating the graph in figure 5, a trendline was created to match the data points. the equation of this trendline was then found to be $y=0.2709$. the trendline was a clear power function, specifically a square root function. in this case then, the exponent on the x, which was 0.4439, was very close to what the theoretical equation would represent on the x which would be 0.5. the theoretical equation is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, where is the length of the string, or the same as the x variable. in this theoretical equation, t is the time period, and g is the gravitational acceleration. the fact that the exponents on the independent variable were quite close shows that there not only was a relationship between the length of the string and the period of the small swing of the pendulum but there was specifically a square root power function relationship between the two variables.  

	the differences between the constants involved in the theoretical equation and the equation generated in lab can be attributed to random error. the fact that the value of (2/ is different than the constant value, 0.2709, obtained in lab was likely due to random error. these random errors included not putting the photogate directly under the pendulum before the swing began. the photogate needed to be at equilibrium before the pendulum swing began but that may not have been exactly the case which would have affected the period of the small swing of the pendulum. another random error also included the fact that the measurement of the controlled variable of the angle of release may have been slightly incorrect. the angle of release was meant to be 10, but it may not have always been exactly on the 10 mark when conducting the experiment with the protractor. this error likely occurred in the experiments conducted before the one involving the photogate as well. another random error associated with the initial experiments includes having a slowed reaction time when using the stopwatch and not measuring the length of the string as accurately as it should have been. in terms of systematic errors, it would be very difficult to be confident that they existed in the first place; however, if they were present it would likely involve the tape measure having incorrect increments of measurements, or the weights not being exactly the designated mass. to minimize random errors, consistent trials were conducted, as demonstrated in table 7 and figure 4. by having many trials, averages are able to be considered thus allowing for less room for random error. another method to reduce error was having one person do one part of the experiment consistently throughout all experiments; one person was in charge of setting up the angle of release, another person was setting up the length of the string, and another person was using the stopwatch, when needed. this would minimize the possibility of random error associated with different people doing different activities and having varying judgements for these measurements. lastly, random error could have been decreased by having the experiments conducted in the same part of the room, thus limiting extenuating circumstances not related to actual parts of the experiments conducted. by taking these measures to reduce random error, overall experimental data would have been more accurate to display whether or not there was a relationship between the independent and dependent variables. 

	when conducting this experiment, there were some constraints that would likely inhibit how generalizable the results could have been. one major constraint was the number of trials that were conducted. table 7 and figure 4 involved ten trials being conducted, but they were mainly completed to minimize error of uncertainty for that specific set of variables. the mass of the weight, angle of release, and length of string were all held constant throughout all trials. however, more trials could have been conducted for the experiment involving the photogate as that would have allowed for more accurate measurements, thus making the obtained results more generalizable. the time constraint that existed prevented a larger number of trials for each experiment, thus making the results much more specified. in relation to the number of trials was a constraint involving the number of people in each group conducting the experiment. more group members would have allowed for more trials to be conducted, thus allowing for more generalizable results. another constraint was related to the environment that we were in, where it was difficult to have longer length of string measurements because of the fact that the pendulum would eventually touch the ground and would not be swinging. had we been in a different environment with a possibility of having longer length of string measurements, a more evident and generalizable relationship could have been graphed and displayed from the data. lastly, a constraint involving the equipment might have caused errors, thus causing differences between what the results obtained in lab were and what the results may be with someone who conducted the same experiment in a different lab. the equipment used in lab, such as the specific tape measure, string, and photogate, may be different than those used in other labs thus causing for a discrepancy between the results observed and, therefore, a lack of generalizability as well.
