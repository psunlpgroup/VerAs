conclusion:
	This lab report is based off of 3 different lab periods, all which contributed valid information and data that will be analyzed and discussed in the remainder of the report. During the first lab period, the independent and dependent variables were chosen and carried over into future lab periods. The dependent variable chosen was the period of the pendulum. These variables would be used to fulfill the research question as following, “What effects the period of a pendulum?” The independent variables chosen were the mass of the weight, the length of the string, and the angle at which the pendulum was released. Hypotheses’ were written for each of these variables. For the first experiment, we used the independent variable of mass, with the controls being the string length and the angle of the release, while the dependent variable stayed the period of the pendulum. The mass of the weights were 50 grams, 70 grams, and 90 grams, while the angle stayed at 45˚, and the string length was 61 cm. The hypothesis for this experiment was as follows, “The period of the pendulum is directly affected by the mass of the weight”. While considering this hypothesis, we predicted that while the mass of the weight increases, the period of the pendulum will get smaller. The table for this given experiment is labeled Figure 1, Data of Mass Experiment shown on page 4. 
The second experiment conducted in this lab period used the independent variable of the angle of release. The controls included the string length and the mass of the weight, while the dependent variable stayed the period of the pendulum. We used the angles 30°, 45°, and lastly 60°. The weight stayed consistent at 50 grams with a 61cm string. The hypothesis read, “the period of the pendulum is directly affected by the angle of the pendulum”. This hypothesis lead to our prediction that if the angle of the pendulum increases, the period will get larger. The table for this information is labeled Figure 2, Data of Angle Experiment on page 5. 
The third experiment conducted in this lab period used the independent variable length of the string. The controls included the mass of the weight, and the angle of release, while the dependent variable stayed the period of the pendulum. We used the lengths 61cm, 51cm, and 40 cm. The mass stayed 50 grams, and the angle used was 45°. The hypothesis formed for this experiment was “The period of the pendulum is directly affected by the length of the string”. This hypothesis led to the prediction that the period of the pendulum would decrease as the length of the string decreases. The table for this information is labeled Figure 3, Data of String Length Experiment on page 5. 
	The second lab period was used to discuss systematic and random error. Since our graphs would not work on excel for the first class (this was something discussed with our TA), we used the data provided from other lab groups previous experiments. This data will be cited upon further conclusions and in the tables and graphs below. Based on the graph of “Period vs. Angle”, the R2 value was found to be .0011, leading to the conclusion that there was no correlation between the angle used and the period of the pendulum. The second graph, “Period vs. Mass” found the R2 value to be .0071, also showing there was no correlation between the mass used and the period of the pendulum. Graph 3, “Period vs. Length” showed an R2 value of .964, concluding that there is a strong positive correlation between the period of the pendulum and the length of the string. For each of these graphs, the uncertainty was found to be .1 seconds. It was also concluded that with a small standard deviation, the values are found to be closer together, not showing much difference in the results because the values are closer to the mean. With a large standard deviation, the values are more spread out which would show more of a difference in the results dues to the values being further from the mean. A random error would have a large standard deviation, while a systematic error would show a smaller standard deviation. The data collected led to a standard deviation of .075. 
	The final lab period was spend conducting an experiment with the length of the string; this was because the string length was the only graph that showed significant results and had a positive correlation between the period of the pendulum. 5 trials were conducted, each time using the same angle of release, 10°, the same mass, 50 grams, and each time decreasing the length in centimeters of the string. The table of results is on page 6, labeled Figure 6, Table of Descending Lengths. The graph created is on page 7 and shows the Period vs Length with error bars, and the R2 value. The theoretical model we were given was       $T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$        . Our model was   $y=0.2309 x^{0.4728}$           These values were very close to the values that were expected. 
	All of these experiments conducted led to the proper results to find significant results. The research question was assessed properly, and all the proper techniques were carried out. The graphs are located on the pages below and show the data collected for each part of the overall experiment. We found the independent variable that showed significant results and conducted an experiment based solely off that, along with the theoretical model. These led to correct results that were close to the expected values.
