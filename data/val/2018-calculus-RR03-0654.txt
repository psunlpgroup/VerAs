conclusion:
During the mass vs. period experiment it was seen that the mass did not affect the period of the pendulum’s swing. As the weight of the pendulum increased the period did not change, showing that the mass of a pendulum does not influence the period for small swings. The graph shows all data points very close to one another. The error bars all over lap showing effectively the same number was measured every time despite the mass of the pendulum changing throughout. 
During the first length vs. period experiment it was seen that the length of a pendulum does affect the period of the pendulum’s swing. As the length is increased so too does the period of a pendulum’s swing. The graph shows that the length of the pendulum is linearly related to the period. As one increases so too does the other. The error bars on the length vs. period graph are very small and do not overlap showing that different and larger periods are measured as the length is increased. 
	During a second experiment more data was gathered with the use of a photogate to further verify that length does indeed affect the period of a pendulum swing. The mass and angle of release were kept constant the entire time. The only change was the length of the pendulum. The length varied from 0.2m to 1.4m. The period varied respectively from 0.867 to 2.367. By using the photo gate the random error of a person’s reaction time when timing was eliminated and this final experiment showed even more definitely that the length is relational to the period of a pendulum’s swing. 

During the angle of release vs. period experiment it was seen that the angle of release did not impact the period of the pendulum for short swings. The angle of release graph vs. period shows that the angle of release does not affect the period. The data does vary slightly. This is due to reaction time of the timer and mismeasurement of a period. The period was counted and then divided by 15 seconds, so gauging the fraction of the pendulum’s swing was an area for inaccuracy. However, the data still shows that overall the period of a pendulum is not affected by the angle of release for small swings. The error bars are all close to one another, but as was mentioned above they do not overlap entirely due to inaccuracies in measurement. 
The theoretical equation for a pendulum swing is is  $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$
Our mathematical equation for a pendulum swing is is  $y = 0.8699 x^{0.5156}$ 
The mathematical equation from our labs supports the theoretical equation in that the power to which x is raised is very close, 0.5. However, the coefficient is very off. This is because the lab lacks a proper representation of theoretical mechanical physics. 
The first random error which was addressed is the reaction time of the person with the stop watch. In the third lab a photogate was used to measure the period which allowed for the random error of a person’s reaction time to be completely eliminated. Also, the measurements were taken three times and averaged so that the random error would be reduced. 
Another error was the systematic error of measuring the period in fifteen seconds. This was addressed by considering the pole from which the pendulum hung to be the quarter or three fourths mark of a period depending on which way the swing was. 
Some restraints of the experiment include the fact that the experiment only applies to pendulum small swings. Large swings are not effectively compared to the conclusions and data gathered in these experiments.
