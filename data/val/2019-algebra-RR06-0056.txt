discussion and conclusion 

the purpose of the lab (lab 05) was to develop a mathematical model for the cart system as mass was moved from the hanging section to the cart.  the purpose of lab 06 was to determine which other factors may affect the acceleration of the system and to determine where the numbers in the mathematical model come from.  lab 06 helped us to develop an understanding of each variable.

the first experiment in lab 05 led to the model that is shown on the graph (figure 1) because the increase in hanging mass led to a larger acceleration of the cart.  the variables increase with each other, which shows a positive correlation as we predicted (as shown in table 3).  i believe that the slope of the line (.0209) in figure 1 is 1/mass.  this is because the y-axis is acceleration and the x- axis is force, which means that the slope comes from acceleration/force which equals 1/mass.  the y-intercept shows that there must be some error, because when the force is 0 the acceleration should also be 0 (meaning the y-intercept would be the origin).  the second experiment in lab 05 led to the model shown in figure 2 because as the cart’s mass was increased, its acceleration decreased.  this is what our group predicted would happen.  the negative exponent shows that the cart’s acceleration decreases as more mass is added to it.  the slope of the graph is the acceleration over the mass, which is why the slope decreased.  as the mass got larger, the acceleration was smaller and smaller leading to a negative correlation to show on the graph.  for the third experiment (lab 06), the mathematical models (shown in figures 3-5) are a result of the acceleration increasing when there was more mass on the hanging section.  however, the slopes shown in the figures (2.288, 2.32, and 2.4063, respectively) are less than they would be without the magnets attached because the magnets slowed down the acceleration of the cart.  the slopes are equal to 1/mass, similar to the slope of the mathematical model derived from the first experiment in lab 05.  the y-intercept of this model is due to some sort of error, because when there is 0 force there should also be 0 acceleration; the graph should pass through the origin and not above it.
these two groups have models and conclusions that support our group’s conclusion.  the results from group 6 (on the left) support our model (figures 3-5) in stating that as friction is added (1 magnet, then 2 magnets, then 3 magnets) the acceleration is going to become increasingly less positive.  while the acceleration is still positive and the cart has some acceleration, this acceleration is going to decrease as more bobbers and magnets are added which increase the cart’s mass and friction.  the whiteboard on the right (which is from group 2 i believe) supports our findings that mass and acceleration have a direct relationship, and as mass of the hanging section is increased, the cart has a larger acceleration, and as the mass of the cart increases, the acceleration decreases.  this shows how these two variables are directly related.

the errors that may have been present are some extra force of friction that we may not have been able to account for (due to the track most likely not being 100% frictionless).  this most likely would have been a systematic error, because the acceleration would have been slowed down due to this.  it is a one-sided error because friction only would have slowed it down rather than sometimes speeding it up and slowing it down other times.  there was not much we could have done to reduce this error, because we were given a track to use and did not have any other options.  also, there may have been some error with air resistance that we could not account for.  this would have been due to the bobbers hanging off all sides of the cart, making the cart less aerodynamic.  just as with the possible error with friction, this error, if present, would have been systematic because it only would have slowed the cart down rather than slowed it down at times and speeding it up at other times.  there was not much we could do to reduce this error because the bobbers were what we were given to change the mass on the cart, and this one option may have come with some unwanted air resistance.  

a constraint in this experiment that may limit the generalizability of our results is that we had a small-scale system to work with, and the masses we used (bobbers) were relatively light and did not give us a large range of data to pull from.  if we had different objects to move from the hanging section to the cart that weighed more, we would have been able to test this on a larger scale.  another constraint in this experiment was our method of giving the cart friction.  the magnets were most likely not very effective in making the cart have a friction force.  the magnets could only be placed on one side, and they most likely had only a small attraction to the tape on the track due to being some distance away from it.  these factors limited the generalizability of our results.

the first mathematical model that we derived from lab 05 is consistent with newton’s second law because the force increases with the acceleration.  this shows that newton’s second law is in effect, because there is a direct correlation between the two.  this is due to the equation $f= m a$.  the mass comes into play because the slope is 1/mass.  the second mathematical model that we derived from lab 06 is consistent with newton’s second law because while there is the force equals the mass * acceleration, with the acceleration being a little slower due to friction.  the graphs show a positive correlation between acceleration and force, which is consistent with newton’s second law because as the acceleration increases, the force does too.
