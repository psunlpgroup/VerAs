conclusion:

the purpose of the lab was the investigate how the acceleration of the system changes as the applied force changes; the applied forces being the mass on the end of the string. the results found show that as the hanging force increased, the acceleration increased. this is shown in the table 3 and graph 1. as the newtons of force increase in the far-right column, the acceleration increases in the second from right column. the graphâ€™s trendline increases in a linear fashion, as shown above. the mathematical model found was $y=3.8971 x-0.0255$ (meters per second squared per newton of force). this mathematical model states that the acceleration increases by 3.8971 m/s2 per newton of force.

	both of the finding by the other groups support what was found in the experimental data. it can be seen that as their hanging forces increase, their accelerations increase in a linear fashion. the mathematical equations they found were also very similar to the that in graph 1, further supporting the claim made.

	the actual theoretical mathematical equation for this experiment was (1/mass of system)f + (friction/mass of system). the found actual model was $y=3.8971 x-0.0255$. these compare well because the mass if the system found was 0.1912 kg. 1/0.1929 which is equal to 5.23. it is close to what was actual found which was 3.8971, and the discrepancy can be due to the fact that the string was no massless. since the string was not massless, it would increase the mass of the overall system, decreasing the slope of the trendline found, also decreasing the acceleration of the cart, per newton of force. the track was to be frictionless, which is why the y-intercept found was such an odd number. friction is the other force that can be found in the experimental and theoretical models, and it is represented in the y-intercept.

	random errors that were present include imperfections in the track. some trials taken would be far off what they would be if repeated, because some of the air holes needed a second to get going to full speed, and there were little debris on the track in some places. to fix this, a good wipe of the track with an alcohol wipe would clean the track off and make it smoother. some systematic error that occurred is air resistance. the equation assumes air resistance is negligible but is present and affects the acceleration of the car. this could be resolved by repeating the test in a vacuum or finding out how much air resistance affects the acceleration of the car. other than these errors, there are no constraints that limit the generalizability of the results. everything found is accurate to the best of the ability of those who performed the experiment.
