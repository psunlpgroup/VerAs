discussion and conclusion

in the lab, we had exams three different independent variables to find out what might affect the pendulum. the first independent was the mass where we changed the hanging mass six times in order to know if its effect on the period of the pendulum. there was only a small difference between the result, in the beginning, we thought that the mass has in effect, but by cambering the different with the other independent, it appears that the period of the pendula does not affect be the mass. the second independent variable is the length of the string, and in our hypothesis, we expect the period of the pendulum is directly related to the length of the string, and that was sillier to what we found in the experiment. that because all the six different lengths of string had provided us with a definite difference period. the third independent variable was the angle of release, and in our hypothesis, we expected the same of the other two independents that it is related directly to the period of the pendulum. there was a small difference between the different angle and not always occur, and that brings us to know that the angle of release does not affect the pendulum’s period. the theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum is equal to 2 π * sqrt of l/g "l is the length of the string.” the error impact in our model due to same factors as inaccurate measuring of the length of the string, the air resistance and friction that caused by the movement around the pendulum, and the slipping in the frame of the pendulum. for having a better result, we might have a set point for the string hang from in the way of not adding a fraction of touching the string not to decrease the period and for smoother shifting. also, adding more mass would decrees the effect on air friction. one of the constraints is the imperfect test area where we had an unclose system that let air friction not constant because of the movements and its effect differently in each try. not having the ability to make the air fraction constant and not having a study of how much it would affect the period of limit our understanding of how much it affected the period pendulum.
