whiteboard 2: group 6, use of magnets

whiteboard 1 is  group 2, angle of track

whiteboard 1 is  group 2, angle of trackthe purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical model for the impact that force applied, and mass of the cart has on acceleration. as well as understand the variables and constants in the models. the experiments conducted in lab 05 led to the mathematical models and the experiment in lab 06 led to the understanding of the variables and constants. the experiment consisted of changing the force on the cart or the mass of the cart and collecting the acceleration of the cart. this data, figure 1 and 2 were used to calculate the model in graph 1 and 2. to get a better understanding of what the models truly meant we focused on the force applied vs acceleration and changed the angle of the track to try to spot a difference in the models. the variables and constants remained the same in graph 1,3 and 4 except for the y intercept, this led us to conclude that the change in angle impacted the friction between the cart and the track. the slopes remained the same depicting that with the certain force, as long as the force remains constant and there is no friction the acceleration will be the same no matter the angle. 





groups 2 and 6 findings show the change in the y intercept as the independent variable changes. both groups findings show the constant for the y intercept is impacted by the angle of the track and the number of magnets. the magnets and angle increase caused the friction to also increase. as the more magnets are added to the cart, the cart is pushed against the track with more force causing more friction. the errors in the experiment were in the starting distance and the force applied. the distance is a random error due to human error with the placement of the car. the distance could be off by millimeters in both directions. the force applied is a systematic error due to the possibility the scale is not calibrated correctly. resulting in an error on one side of the true value. the constraints that limited us was the amount of air being pushed out of the track. we were unable to experience zero friction between the track and cart. this limits the generalizability of our results by not having a perfect mathematical model. the two mathematical models are consistent with newtonâ€™s second law, $f=ma$ because as the force increases and mass remains constant the acceleration also increases. for the second model, the mass increases and the force remain constant resulting in the acceleration decreasing.
