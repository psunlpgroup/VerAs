discussion and conclusion:
	

the research question for this experiment is what truly effects the acceleration of a system containing one hanging mass, and another mass on a cart.  based on the hanging mass graph, it can be determined that acceleration and hanging mass have a direct relationship. this makes sense because as the acceleration increases, so does the applied force on the track. the relationship makes sense because the equation $f = m a$ holds true.  the experimental model may experience several systematic errors, and does not consider friction, which has a profound effect on the acceleration of the system.  we are confident in the numbers that we acquired from our experimental procedure. the ranges of uncertainty were well within an acceptable deviation.

mathematical model was determined by using newton's law $f=m a$. during the experiment we found the velocity of the cart and used the slope from the velocity to get the acceleration. once we had the acceleration, we already knew the mass of the system therefore we knew f. mathematical model 2 was determined by using newton's law again. during the experiment the mass of the cart was changed in order to see how this affected the velocity which would then affect the acceleration. once we calculated the mass and acceleration, we knew the relationship with f that was created.

we are very confident in our mathematical model 1 $a=2.4159 x+.0505$ r^2 is 0.9997 because the trendline passes through the graph sufficiently. also, our a and r^2 values are slightly like the values other groups presented.

		groups 5 and 6 came up the following values $a=.0024 x-.0292$ r^2 is 0.9885 and $a=0.0029 x-.008$ r^2 is 0.999. the findings of groups 5 and 6 challenges our findings and it could be for several reasons whether systematic or human error.  the difference in findings does.

		 the experimental mathematical model, $a=c1 w+c2$, supports the theoretical model because it shows the same relationship.  the enhanced theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$.  c2 represents the force of friction of the cart.  the larger the force of friction, the smaller the y-intercept is of the trend line.  as the force of friction increases, the acceleration decreases, this is an inverse relationship.  force and mass are still directly related.  factors that contributed would be the relationship between force and acceleration, along with the relationship with friction. it is friction plus the horizontal force of gravity. this is the “b” value of the equation. the c1 value is the inverse of mass.  friction and acceleration of a system are inversely related.  using a string that was not weightless would impact the acceleration of the system because it would have to be added to the mass of the system.  the acceleration would be smaller.

our results do support newton’s second law as since the force is equal to the mass times acceleration, as we increase the mass, the acceleration is also changing. since both variables increase, so will the resulting force. 

the only differences between our models and newton’s second law would be that for some of our data, the trend line doesn’t change tremendously, or it changes a lot. newton’s second law has a more consistent change between the relationship between force and mass times acceleration. 

of course, the experiment wasn’t perfect, there were defiantly a few errors that can be applied.  the distance that we started the cart at could affect our results. we only made sure to start each trial at the same spot, but we did not test it from different starting points to see if the distance made an impact on anything. they could be investigated by finding velocity and seeing if the acceleration has a major difference within the results.  maybe have the track set up so where you load in the car, so it starts at the same spot every time. this would help as if we were to put it at the starting point each time, we could have it slightly off each time. 

	there is a correlational relationship between the net force and acceleration because if acceleration increases, then so will the net force, if the mass remains constant.
