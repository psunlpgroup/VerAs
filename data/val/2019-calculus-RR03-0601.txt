conclusion:
 what impacts the period of the pendulum?

the first experiment performed was weight as iv and period length as dv. the claim that was made was that there is no correlation to weight and period length. the graph and data showed that as weight increased the length of the period did not show a strong correlation. however, there is a decent amount of error due to the data being collected by hand through a stop watch. the data can still show that there no correlation between the two.

the second experiment performed was angle of release as iv and period length as dv. the claim was that there is a positive correlation between angle of release and period length. the graph showed that there could be some sort of positive correlation after the angle is larger than 20 degrees, however, the error bars in the graph are quite large. this could be due to the data collected being recorded by hand through a stopwatch.

the third and fourth experiment performed was testing the string length as the iv and the period length as the dv. the claim was that there is a positive correlation between the two. as the string length increases the period length will too. the third experiment was performed through hand with a stopwatch and had large error values and was hard to determine the positive correlation between the iv and dv. when the experiment was performed again using photo gates to measure when a period was completed. this eliminated almost all the error and created error bars that were too small to notice. the fourth experiment showed the actual power relationship curve that the string length and period length have.

$t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ this is the actual equation for the length of a period of a pendulum. the equation we derived was $y=0.2038 x^{0.4989}$. this was derived using the equation for the line in excel. the 2nd string as iv graph includes the equation and the line. you can see that angle of release and weight are not included as variables in this equation because the angle is assumed to be less than or equal to 20.

 errors that were present in the experiment were that in the experiments with a stopwatch present the person using it could be slow or fast in there stopping of the watch. another possible error would be that the weight is not being released at exactly the right angle or is being released more to one side. what was done to reduce those errors was a photo gate was implemented to track exactly when the pendulum passes through a point, and a protractor was held up to the string every trial to get it as close to the desired measurement as possible.
 constraints in the experiment that limit the generalization of the results are that there was not a very large length of string tested to achieve the equation, the experiment was only performed with a certain pendulum set-up, and certain weight distribution of the pendulum. these factors make the results less generalizationable because they can be different if the experiments are reproduced.
