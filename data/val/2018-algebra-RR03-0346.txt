conclusion:
What impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? The data in the graph indicated that there is a relationship between the period of the pendulum and the length of the string. The longer the string was, the longer it took for the pendulum to make a full period in one small swing. The measurement of the string may have been incorrectly measured due to the ruler not being placed correctly against the apparatus, resulting in a possible random error. This experiment has a smaller standard deviation, which suggests that there is a smaller chance for systematic error. 

Our mathematical model resulted with an equation of $y=0.1783 x^{0.5224}$ which is very comparable to the theoretical mathematical model of $y=0.2x^{0.5}$. The theoretical mathematical model equation results with a period of 1.4142s when the length is 50cm $y=0.2^{0.5}$ . While our mathematical model equation resulted with a period of 1.3762s. The calculated period of our mathematical model equation and the theoretical one is very comparable.

To reduce the systematic errors given in our experiment, we could have tested the equipment before beginning the procedure to make sure that all of the necessary items were calibrated correctly. To reduce random errors presented in our experiment, our group could have taken more data and completed more trials to ensure better quality of the experiments.
