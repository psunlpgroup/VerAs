discussion and conclusion



the pendulum lab examined what variable(s) impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. the first experiment was a preliminary exercise to develop an idea of how the three variables, length, mass, and angle, affect the period of a pendulum. with only three data points for each graph (graphs 1-3), the relationships that were determined could not be said with certainty for their accuracies. the second experiment delved deeper into the errors of the experiment conducted in week 1. we examined our research and measurement methods to determine a variety of errors, and conducted a small experiment to determine the uncertainty of our measurements. using the uncertainty, we could determine whether or not the relationships we previously made between the variables and period were correct or not. we did this by adding error bars to our graphs from experiment 1 (graphs 3-6). we used an equivalency criterion of ±2σ to determine if two values may be equivalent. seeing that the first and last values overlapped, meaning they could be the same, in both the period vs. angle and period vs. mass, but not period vs. length, we determined that the only variable that had a distinct relationship with the period of a pendulum was length. we also looked at the size of the error bars. the error bars in graph 3 were much smaller than in graph 4 and graph 6. this is further evidence to say that period and length have a valid relationship compared to the other two variables. now that we determined the correct relationship between variables, or lack thereof, experiment 3 examined if the mathematical model we predicted was correct. to do this, we collected data over a much larger range, with 100 cm difference between our first and last lengths, and did multiple trials to reduce random error, graphing the average period for each length. we tried a linear fit, only to discover that with more data points, the points did not line up as well as before (graph 7 vs graph 1). we then tried an exponential fit when we noticed the line was slightly curved, and the graph was nearly perfect, with a correlation of 0.9999 (graph 8). 

the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ where l is the length of a pendulum and g is the gravitational constant. if the constants were simplified and the variables tweaked to show an exponential equation, the theoretical model would be $t=2.007 l^{0.5}$. the constant is an approximation. our equation was $t=0.1946 l^{0.5071}$. we definitely got the exponent of 0.5 very close, but our constant is significantly off. 



to account for this discrepancy from actual values, there are a variety of errors that we encountered in the experiments conducted. the random errors we could have encountered were not measuring the length correctly and not measuring the angle correctly and dropping the pendulum from the exact same spot each time. another random error could also come from incorrectly measuring the period of the pendulum with the stopwatch; if the experimental setup is viewed from different angles, interpretation of how long the period lasts varies. human error from simply being unable to catch the exact moment when the period starts and ends and being unable to catch it on the stopwatch is also plausible. we also discovered that our tape measure’s metal end plate, the part that juts out to hold onto a surface, is not tightly attached to the tape measure itself, leaving about 1.5 cm extra to the measurements. because the plate is loose, it could randomly move and attribute to another source of random error in measuring length. finally, another source of error comes from letting the pendulum go and perhaps accidently applying a small force to the pendulum instead of letting it free-fall. we also discussed possible systematic errors. first, the stopwatches we used could have not been calibrated correctly, and the weights that we used could have had a slight deviation from its supposed values. also, depending on where you live, the gravitational constant can vary from 9.8.  finally, during our last experiment, we discovered that we had been measuring length incorrectly by only measuring the length of the string and not the handle of the weight as well. we were only able to fix the last experiment’s data by adding this extra length to all of our string lengths. to fix these errors, at least the random errors, we were more careful with our measurements for length and angle, trying to repeat the same technique every time. we also used multiple stopwatches to measure the same period and average them. in conjunction with using multiple stopwatches for one period, we repeated this for several trials and averaged the times. in measuring the period, we all also tried to stand at the same angle of viewing and established exactly when the pendulum period started and ended. fortunately, we were able to detect a systematic error in measuring our lengths and fixed this, as aforementioned, but other systematic errors are hard to determine and difficult to remedy. fortunately, it seems our efforts were not in vain as our last experiment and data were of good quality. we didn’t have any constraints, other than in the first experiment we only collected 3 data points, and therefore we did not have a big enough range of length values and we only did 1 trial. in order to understand and correctly see the relationship, we had to take a much larger range and conduct multiple trials (see table 9).
