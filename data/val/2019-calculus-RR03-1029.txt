discussion and conclusion:


to find the research question asked, what impacts the period of the pendulum? we considered three main factors is  the mass of the pendulum, the length of the pendulum swing, and the angle of release. our team did several tests with each as the independent variable and the period length the dependent variable in every test. 

when mass was the independent variable and length and angle of release were constants, we found there to be no correlation between the mass and the pendulum period. using the data in graph and table 3 supports this statement. in graph and table 4 the uncertainty values and error bars are displayed, that data also proves there is no correlation between the mass and the period (iv and dv). therefore we can conclude that the mass does not affect the pendulums period length. 


when the length of the pendulum swing was the independent variable and the mass and angle of release were the constants there was a non-linear correlation displayed. overall when you look back to the data displayed in graph and table 1, you can conclude that there is somewhat of a positive correlation and as the string length increases the period of the pendulum increases as well. using the equation when t is the period length, $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{f_g}}$ , our data and correlation is modelled well. after the experiment we produced our own power equation of $t=0.0189 l^{0.52}$ along with the other tables who had similar power equations, which were all very similar to the actual power model that has a power of ½. the data in graph and table 2, which includes the error and uncertainty values, matched up with the equation 100%.


when the angle of release of the pendulum swing was the independent variable and the mass and length were the constants there was not a correlation between them. we tested several different angles, with large and small jumps in between the angles, and every time we found the data was all very close together. the data from these tests can be found in graph and table 5 and 6. 5 showed that there was no real correlation and 6 contains the error bars where in theory the actual values are within.


we found that all of our tests throughout this experiment contained a lot of human error, equipment error, and outside influences. originally the period of the pendulum could not be accurately measured using the stopwatch, but to fix this in the last lab we used a photogate which calculated the period a lot more accurately and precisely. another human error factor that we had was the angle the pendulum was released from and how it was dropped. this problem was not fixed in our experiment but in the future a devise that could be used to more accurately drop the pendulum. other equipment error that should be taken into account is is  tape measure, stop watch, photogate, or the stand the pendulum was on. 
	the constraints of this experiment include, the string, the pendulum stand, and the mass tied to the string. the string and the pendulum stand worked together in a way and the string could have slipped down from its position because the stand was not tight enough or it could create a swing that isn’t as straight as we would want it. the mass at the end could not accurately be the mass displayed along with creating another swing apart from the pendulum swing, throwing data off.
