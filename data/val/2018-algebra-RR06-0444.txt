discussion and conclusion:
the purpose of the lab was to develop a mathematical model to predict the motion of an object due to an applied force by using an air track, rotary motion detector, cart, and weights. the prediction was that there would be a positive linear relationship when the applied force is increased then the acceleration will also increase. from the data collected, the hypothesis stated can be supported and this is shown in figure 1. figure 1 shows a positive linear line and the mathematical model obtained from the graph is $y=0.005 x - 0.017$. the r² is 0.99568 value is significant because it shows that it is very close to the value of 1 which shows that the data is very close to the regression line. the average uncertainty value is 0.0106 which is very small. some systematic errors that could have affected these values include is  the air track was not completely smooth, the string had knots so it could have created some friction, the scale was not set correctly when measuring out masses. air resistance and friction could be a possibility but they are negligible. another factor that could have caused error includes kinetic friction, not having a consistent mass for each fishing bob, or mass of the string. some random error that could have affected these values include is  not using the scale properly to measure the masses and not knowing how to use the sensor. the environmental factors also mentioned in figures 2 and 3, which is also what we came up with as a group.


the theoretical equation is formed by using $f=m a$ and when it is rearranged it can be used to find the acceleration, $a=\frac{f}{m}$. the enhanced version of that equation is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. the mass of the system is already known we can place it into the equation, therefore it will be $a=\frac{f}{186.75}$. the experimental model that was obtained from figure 1 is $y=0.005 x - 0.017$ and this can be compared to the model that was shown in class which is, $a=c1 w+c2$. c1 is the slope which is 0.005 and the c2 is the y-intercept which is -0.017. 

when comparing the experimental data from the other 2 groups, they are somewhat similar. in figure 2, the mathematical equation that they obtained was $a= 5.1366 f-0.0022$ and in figure 3, the mathematical equation that they obtained was $y=6.285 x-0.073$. the reason why both of their slopes are a lot greater than our value of 0.005, is because that they converted their fishing bob mass to kilograms and we kept ours in grams. our values are not exact and this can be due to systematic error because we did not use the same exact equipment or random error. 

the possible errors could be voided by having one person assigned to each task. for example, it would be ideal to have one person measuring the mass of the fishing bobs, one person setting up the system on the air track, one person starting the rotary motion detector. this would possibly remove a lot of random error that is created due to the consistency. another way to remove error is to repeat the trial for each mass multiple times then average them before plotting the value onto the graph. if there was any random error or systematic errors this could help in our data system the values will be averaged. some constraints that could affect the generalizability of the results would be not knowing how to use the equipment that was provided. for example, if the researcher did not know how to use the computer program that graphed the system it would be difficult to obtain the values we needed to create the mathematical model. or even not knowing what type of materials such as string or the type of track that would give the least amount of friction.
