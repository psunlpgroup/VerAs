discussion and conclusion:

	the purpose of this lab was to investigate what factors contribute to the period length of a pendulum.  the factors being investigated were pendulum mass, pendulum length, and angle of release.  experiment 1 addressed this question by holding pendulum mass and angle of release constant to examine the effects of pendulum length on period length.  based on the experimental data found in table 1 and figure 1, it was found that period length was directly proportional to pendulum length, so long as the angle was held near to below 30.  the error bars in this plot were found to have no overlap and therefore the values were almost certainly different.  experiment 2 addressed the research question by holding pendulum length and angle of release constant in order to examine the effects of pendulum mass on period length.  based on the experimental data found in table 2 and figure 2, it was found that pendulum mass had no discernable effect on period length, so long as release angle was near or below 30.  this is because the values in the plot were supposed to be the same in period length, as their error bars overlapped.  experiment 3 addressed the research question by holding pendulum length and mass constant in order to examine the effects of release angle.  based on the experimental data found in table 3 and figure 3, it was determined that release angle had no discernable effect on period length, so long as the angle was less than 30.  this is because the values in the plot were supposed to be the same in period length, as their error bars overlapped.

the theoretical mathematical model of period of a pendulum is  , where t is the period in seconds, l is the length in meters, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.  our data fits this model reasonably well as it showed a linear relationship between pendulum length and period length.  shown in figure 1 is the plot of the data produced from testing this relationship, and the trendline is clearly linear, represented by the equation

 , where y is the period length and x is the pendulum length in cm.  this relationship is also linear in the theoretical model.  this relationship of 0.013 was a much stronger indication of a relationship between the variables than the trendlines produced in figures 2 and 3.  the slope of the trendlines investigating the effect mass and release angle were 0.0025 and 1e-4 respectively, indicating no relationship.

	the most significant source of random error in the experiments conducted were associated with the timing of the period.  this was done by hand with stopwatches, which is subject to human error.  this error was reduced to the best of our ability by having two timers, taking the average of the two times recorded, and then taking the average of three trials under each set of conditions.

	the fact that only angles of 30 and less were used during experimentation limit the generalizability of our results to pendulum circumstances for small angles.
