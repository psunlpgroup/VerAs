discussion and conclusion

	what impacts the period of a pendulum?

		three variables were investigated experimentally to determine what impacts the period of a pendulum is  length of the string, mass of the weight attached (bob), and angle from which the pendulum is released.  the experimental design plans shown in tables 1-3 explain how each variable was investigated.  to determine the impact of string length, five different lengths were tested, while the mass of the bob and angle of release were controlled at 50 grams and 60 degrees, respectively.  for the impact of bob mass, five different masses were tested, as the length of the string was held at 9 inches and the angle of release at 60 degrees.  the impact of release angle was determined by testing five different angles and keeping the string length at 9 inches and the bob mass at 50 grams.  for each test, the time it took for the pendulum to complete ten full swings was recorded using a stopwatch.  these times were then divided by ten to determine the period, and the average of the trials was determined and graphed.  the data is depicted in tables 4-6.  it was claimed that as the length of the string increases, the period of the pendulum will increase; as the mass of the bob increases, the period of the pendulum will decrease; and finally, as the angle of release increases, the period of the pendulum will increase.  of these three, only one claim is valid and supported by the results.  figure 1, which is a graph of the data from table 4, suggests that there is a positive correlation between string length and period of a pendulum â€“ that is, as string length increased, the period of the pendulum increased.  however, figure 2, which is a graph of the data in table 5, indicates that there is no correlation between bob mass and period of a pendulum.  this is also true for figure 3, a graph of the data in table 6, that is, there is no correlation between release angle and period of a pendulum for small swings.  it was concluded that length of the string does impact the period of a pendulum, but the angle of release and mass of the bob do not.

		the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is as follows is 

	         or      

	this is true such that l is the length of the string and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s).  due to the square root in the equation, this would be considered a power relationship.  the mathematical model was determined experimentally using the photogate apparatus.  string length was the only variable tested because it had evidence, mentioned above, that it affected the period of a pendulum.  it is also evident that release angle and bob mass are not taken into consideration in the theoretical mathematical model.  the data from photogate is represented in table 7 and shown as a graph in figure 4.  the best-fit trendline had an equation of

	

	and an r2 value of 0.9954, given a power function, which was the closest to 1 out of all the mathematical models. this means that the trendline passes through nearly all the data points and that there is a statistical correlation between the string length of period of the pendulum.  the coefficient of the theoretical model is 2.0071 and in the experimental model, it is 2.0368.  though there is some discrepancy, the numbers are very close given that gravitational acceleration was never accounted for in the experiments.  because the experimental model is a power function like the theoretical model, it successfully displays a relationship between string length and period of pendulum.

		both systematic and random errors were present in the experiment.  systematic errors included air resistance affecting the motion of the pendulum. this could only be reduced by changing test conditions, e.g. conducting the experiment in a vacuum, or by taking air resistance into consideration.  random errors include slow reaction time by the experimenter causing the period of the pendulum to be shorter or longer than it actually was; not using a spherical weight causing the center of mass to be off; or misaligning the protractor to measure release angle.  random errors could be and were reduced simply by increasing the number of trials and adjusting procedural techniques, such as fixing the position of the protractor.  by taking more measurements, the more accurate the average value is, i.e. the closer it is to the true value.  a constraint in this experiment is that the period of pendulum for small swings was investigated.  given lab materials, the mass of the bob was never going to exceed 150 grams and the length would never be longer than that of a measuring tape.  therefore, the results can only be generalized towards small-scale pendulums.
