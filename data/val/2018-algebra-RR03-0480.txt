discussion and conclusions:

the question being investigated through the first two experiments was what variable affected the period length of a pendulum. the first experiment allowed us to understand that the only true variable that affected the period length was the string length. this can be seen in the figures 1-3. figures 1 and 2, which explored the affects of mass and angle of release, have data values which have overlapping error bars. the overlapping error bars indicated that the measured values could have been equal due to the uncertainty the accompanied the stopwatch. the data in figure 3 does not have overlapping error bars, which indicated that the measured values for each string length are unique to that certain string length, even when uncertainty is considered. 

the research question to the third experiment was to determine a mathematical equation for the relationship between string length and period length. the data in figure 3 shows that the relationship between string length and period length is a nonlinear relationship. in fact, with the line of best fit drawn, it is easy to see the relationship is a power relationship. the error bars that were added to the graph, 0.001, were too small to be seen. the uncertainty value is the error value that is accompanied by the error of the photogate.

the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, where t is the period length, ùëô is the string length, and g is acceleration of gravity which is -9.8. through the third experiment, we derived a mathematical equation that was very similar to this equation. rewritten, this equation has a constant, 2œÄ/‚àö(g), which is equal to .2007 cm/s^2. through the data collected in table 4 and its accompanying figure 4, the graph shows that power line of best fit to be $y=0.1997 x^{0.5008}$ which has a constant that is very similar. mass and angle of release are not included in the theoretical model; therefore, they do not have an affect of the period length (t).

there was random error that could have accompanied our experiment. the stopwatch could have been started and stopped at different point each period length. this error was reduced by taking multiple trials and finding the average of them. another random error that could have occurred was incorrect reading of the length of the string. to reduce this error in the future, we should have two lab members read the length of the strings and take the average of their two readings.

some constraints that might limit the generalizability to our experiment is the low trial numbers for each experiment and the low variability in our factors, such as angle length and masses.
