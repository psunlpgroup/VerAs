conclusion: 
the slope on the airtrack has an impact on the acceleration, as the slope becomes more negative so does the c2 constant
 how does a negative slope on the airtrack effect the acceleration?
 lack of air resistance testing, this could be corrected by testing the experiment in a vacuum

inaccuracy in weights, which could be corrected by weighing our weights on a scale before using it in our trials

lack of enough data points, which could be corrected by taking more data samples
