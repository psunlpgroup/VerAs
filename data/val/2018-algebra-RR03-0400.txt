discussion and conclusion

	the research question for this lab was whether or not the weight, length, or angle of release would have an impact on the period of a pendulum. all three experiments helped us learn a lot about the period of the pendulum; with some of the experiments showing us more than others. in table 4/figure 1 the weight has a slight impact on the period of the pendulum. it speeds up slightly but is not significant by our error bars standard. they all fall within the same error which means our data points may be different just because of error. in table 5/figure 2, the length of the string has the most impact on the period of the pendulum. the data shows that the points are well far enough away from one another to show it is significant. the data is also consistent with our prediction from table 2 of a larger length causing a longer period of the pendulum. in table 6/figure 3, the angle of release is like the weight of the pendulum. our data shows that our prediction in table 3 was inconclusive because of our error bars. all our data points fall within the error bars except on that was an inconclusive because it was a point that was not in the data set given from the professor. 

		to further confirm our findings of the impact of weight, length, and angle of release, we looked up the mathematical model for the period of a pendulum. we found that it is       $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$                 (allain) and contains only the length, not weight or angle of release. this information helps confirm that our length data was the only significant data we have collected. to prove this point we went further and tested the length again with a photogate which has a scale error of 0.001s. this data can be seen in table 7/figure 4 and is backed up by the fact that the mathematical model for a pendulum follows a power series; which our length graph also followed. the two other graphs however, followed a linear path which can be seen by drawing a line through their error bars. when it comes to error that was involved in these experiments, most of the error was found to be systematic error within our measuring devices. the only random error we ran into was the starting and stopping of the stop watch. this was solved by using a photogate which had a smaller error. the systematic errors we ran into were the weights being off, and the string being old. for these to be fixed, anyone trying the experiment should use new materials. our group did not run into any experiment constraints; however, with this being our first lab together, the social aspect of the lab was lacking. we overcame these constraints and were able to determine that only the length of the string can have a significant impact on the period of a pendulum.
