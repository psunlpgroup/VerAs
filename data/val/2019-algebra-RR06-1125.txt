discussion and conclusion

the purpose of the lab 05 was to develop mathematical models that help describe how the real system is. also the purpose of lab 06 was to learn about other factors or variables that change the numerical values in the models.
the three experiments done in lab 05 and lab 06 allowed us to come to a conclusion about the impact of different variables on the acceleration of the system. in the first experiment we were focusing on the variable of hanging weight this was the independent variable. the dependent variable was the acceleration of the system and when we plotted the force of the hanging weight on the x axis and the acceleration in the y axis (as seen in graph 1 lab 05) we can up with a linear regression. the acceleration was found after finding the derivative of the speed of the system using the computer program and repeated trials. the mathematical model of the first model is $a=c f + c$ or $a=26.798 f+0.0048$ for our data. the 26.798 represents 1/kg. looking at the standard deviation we can see that it is less than .001 so there are no error bars which helps us know that our data is more accurate. this further explains that the mass and acceleration are positively correlated.

with the second model we left our hanging mass the same and changed the mass of the cart. the mathematical model for this experiment is $a=c1 m^{-1}$ or $a=0.1339 x^{-0.971}$ for our data (as seen in graph 2 lab 05) the .1339 represents f. the physical meaning of the c1 value is 1/kg.

the model shows us a power relationship as seen in the graph between the mass and acceleration. the relationship between increasing the  mass of the cart and the acceleration was a negative or inverse correlation. our for the ^-1 was fairly close so this supports that our mathematical model is close to the theoretical model. 
in lab 06 we looked at the impacts of changing the forward tilt of the track and its effect on the acceleration. the independent variable was the tilt of the track and the mass of the system was kept constant. we found as the tilt increased by .25 inch increments the acceleration also consistently increased as well. we can clearly see the c2 value increasing when comparing graph 3, 4 and 5 in lab 06. increasing c2 value means that the acceleration was increasing because the physical meaning of the c2 value is f. 
their hypothesis and conclusion support our hypothesis and conclusion. they also use the same evidence of the c₂ increases as the tilt of the air track is increased. c₂ is the value which represents the force acting on the object.  
they knew that the acceleration was decreasing because their data showed the c₂ value decreasing. their data indicates that friction impacts the acceleration of a system. according to their graphs and equations, their acceleration decreased as they added more magnets. this is shown by their c₂ value which is steadily getting more negative. 
the first thing that we could do would be to perform more trails. this is the easiest way to ensure that we have more accurate data. we could have used weights that were identical so that we didn’t have to account for the mass of each bob being different. this could have lead to calculation errors as well. also we could use an electric scale for measuring the bobs rather than the triple balance beam so that there is no human error involved. any differentiation could be systematic error which is much better than random error due to humans since the standard deviation would be impacted less. 
one constraints we encountered was that we had a limited amount of bricks to put under the system this meant that we could only measure the height to .75 inches. the problem with this was that we weren’t able to get more data to further support our conclusion that the tilt impacts the acceleration of the system. another issue we had was with the length of the string. due to the placement of the system we weren’t able to use a heavier hanging mass. also we were limited with the amount of weight we could use to attach to the string and system. all of these factors restricted different parts of the lab.  
our two labs showed mathematical models that were consistent with newton’s second law. the equation is $f=m a$ and in the first model c1 is describing 1/kg and c2 is describing the change of force of the system. using the reciprocal of 1/kg we can see that it is a force since it would be a mass of some kind and then the acceleration would become into play in the equation $a=c1 m^{-1}$. adding the forces together would give you the sum of the forces.
if a heavy string was used then the acceleration of the hanging mass would decrease as the mass moves down since there is more heavy string pulling it down. in this case the graph wouldn’t be linear it would be more like a power regression.
