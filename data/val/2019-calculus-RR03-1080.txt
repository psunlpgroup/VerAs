conclusion:

in this lab, we investigated how three different factors affected the time length of one period of a pendulum; the mass of the pendulum, the length of the pendulum, and the angle the pendulum is released at. in our first experiment, we focused on the angle of release. in our experiment, we released a 150g mass attached to a 44.00cm long string from angles of 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees from vertical. heather measured and dropped the mass each time, while dival and i both timed how long it took for the pendulum to complete five periods. we took the average of our times for each trial and divided the result by five to come up with the time it took to complete one period. jack recorded the information. as we found with our data, there is no real correlation between the angle the pendulum is dropped at and the time it takes for the pendulum to complete one period. as you can see in figure 1, while the period changes slightly with each angle, the error bars overlap more than enough to determine that there is no correlation. for our second experiment, we compared the mass of the pendulum to the period. we followed the same procedure, releasing from an angle of 15 degrees, and chose the masses 110g, 130g, 150g, 170g, and 190g. this experiment also resulted in no correlation. as you can see in figure 2 the time values are all nearly the same and are well within the error bars of each other. in our final experiment, we compared the length of the string used to the period. we used a string of lengths 18.50cm, 26.20cm, 34.00cm, 44.00cm, and 52.30cm. this experiment did yield a result. while many of the points are within the error bars of another, as seen in figure 3, from the shortest length to the longest length there is a clear positive correlation. 

the equation that we came up with for the effect of length of string on a pendulum is . the theoretical equation found online was , which computes to be the same as  assuming earth’s gravity.  remains constant on earth and is within .09 of the value we came up with. the power of l that we came up with was 0.0526 off from the theoretical power. as discussed earlier, angle and mass did not affect the period of the pendulum, which makes sense as neither variable is in the theoretical equation. we did not test gravity, as we cannot possibly change the gravitational force of earth, however the impact of length is an exponential function as we assumed.

most of our probable error in this experiment was random. it is very well possible that the angle the pendulum was dropped at was not entirely consistent, or that dival and i didn’t accurately measure the time. as is clearly seen in figure 6, some of our data, for example with the 18.50cm length string, was very precise, while other data, such as with the 52.30cm length string, was very random. to try to account for the timing error, we had jack time the pendulum as well in future experiments, to get a more diverse set of data that would possibly lead us closer to accurate values. some systematic error that we did experience is that the weights weren’t exactly 20g each, which we found out after conducting the experiment. in the future we should double check all given data before starting the experiment.

constraints in this experiment that could limit generalizability include that, as stated earlier, the weights were not exactly 20g as we expected. another constraint is that it is impossible to confirm that the angle we dropped the pendulum at was exactly the correct measure with the way we were measuring it. heather eyeballed the measurement and could have easily also moved the string slightly while getting everything else set up or waiting to drop the pendulum.
