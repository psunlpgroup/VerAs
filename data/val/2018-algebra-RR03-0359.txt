conclusion:
The first factor tested was the mass of the bob. The pendulum was set up to where the control variables remained constant (length of string 86.5cm, angle of release 30degrees). The independent variable for these trials is the mass of the bob, with the dependent variable being the period of the pendulum. Two students would time the period, while one ran the pendulum, and the other student would record the period and average the two times when necessary. The testable hypothesis included that there would be a correlation between the mass of the bob and the period of the pendulum. It was initially hypothesized that while the mass of the bob increased, the period of the pendulum would occur faster/become a shorter time. (Uncertainties estimated includes half of the smallest unit of measurement possible. Uncertainty for each measurement includes is  (plus,minus) 1 degree, (plus,minus) 1g, (plus,minus) 1 cm, and (plus,minus) 0.002s)



The second factor tested was the angle of release. The pendulum was set up to where the control variable remained constant (length of string 45cm, mass of bob 50g). The independent variable for these trials is the angle of release, with the dependent variable being the period of the pendulum. The pendulum was run, and the period was timed and recorded just as it was in the trial before. The testable hypothesis stated that there would be a correlation between the angle of release and the period of the pendulum. It was initially hypothesized that as the angle of release increased, the period would become longer. (Uncertainty for each measurement includes is  (plus,minus) 1 degree, (plus,minus) 1g, (plus,minus) 1 cm, and (plus,minus) 0.002s)

The third factor tested was the length of the string. The pendulum was set up to where the control variables remained constant (mass of bob 50g, angle of release 30 degrees). The independent variable of these trials is the length of the string, with the dependent variable being the period of the pendulum. The pendulum was run, and the period was timed and recorded just as before. The testable hypothesis stated that there would be a correlation between the length of the string and the period of the pendulum. It was initially hypothesized that while the length of the string increased, the period would become longer as well (vice versa). (Uncertainty for each measurement includes is  (plus,minus) 1 degree, (plus,minus) 1g, (plus,minus) 1 cm, and (plus,minus) 0.002s)

	To be able to calculate standard deviation, another trial was set up. Similarly, to before, the pendulum would be set up and the period would be timed and recorded. However, to calculate the standard deviation, all the factors of the pendulum remained constant for these 10 trials. The standard deviation was revealed as 0.050884.
While investigating what factors impacts the period of a pendulum with small swings, it was revealed that both the angle of release and the mass of the bob do not impact the period. The only tested variable that impacts the period of a pendulum is the length of the string. Therefore, it can be claimed, that for a pendulum with small swings, the mass of the bob and the angle of release have no impact on the period. To find an accurate claim of the relationship between the length of the string and the period of the pendulum another trial was set up. To account for any random errors, a photogate was used instead of having two students time the period. The trials were run with the control variables remaining constant, and the independent variable as the length of the string (with the dependent variable being the period of the pendulum).
Thus, one can state that for a pendulum with small swings, the period of the pendulum increases with the length of the string increasing as well.
	With the previous trial, the experimental mathematical model equation was calculated with having a power curve function as the line of best fit to give R^2 a value closest to one (0.9961). Our mathematical model resulted with an equation of $y=0.1783 x^{0.5224}$, which is very comparable to the theoretical mathematical model. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the trial and the mathematical model equation is quite representative of the period of a pendulum with small swings.
	Possible random errors experienced in this lab may include the timing of the period, as well as the measuring of the three tested independent variables. To minimize some of the random errors, the timing of the pendulum was recorded by a single photogate. This method represents a more accurate timing of the period, rather that having the average of two values. It seems that there are no systematic errors worth mentioning because the systematic errors would not impact the period of the pendulum anyway. 
A possible constraint of this lab includes that the mathematical model only applies to pendulums with swings smaller than 30 degrees. The calculated mathematical model equation does not apply to swings of a pendulum with a release angle greater than 30 degrees.
