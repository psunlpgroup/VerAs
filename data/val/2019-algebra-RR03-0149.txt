the research question that was being investigated in this lab was “what affects the period of a pendulum?”

for the mass of the object versus the time it took to complete one period we concluded that it is not related to the time. we were able to draw this conclusion by changing the weight and keeping all other variables controlled. the graph showed no correlation and an r^2 value of .0196 and from this we made our claim. for the length of the string versus the time it takes to complete one period we determined that they are related. based on the graph we can see positive correlation which indicated that the independent variable and dependent variable do relate. the r^2 value was also .9875 which allows for us to make our claim. for the angle of release versus the time we concluded that it does have somewhat of a correlation but is not completely related. when we tested the angle, we found that when the angle value is less than 30 degrees it has no correlation and only when it is above 30 degrees, we see a correlation. by this we can claim that the angle has some relation to the time, but it is dependent on the scenario.

the accurate equation for the period of a pendulum is ) where l is the length of the string. we can see by the table and graph for length of string versus time that it does relate and that is because it is within the equation. within this equation there is no variable that is assigned to the mass and the graph and data table backup the mathematical equation because there is no correlation between the data. lastly, we see that the angle does play a part in the mathematical model. the angle comes into play when you are determining the horizontal and vertical direction for “mg”. when the angle is below 30 degrees it has very different affects on the pendulum, but when it is above 30 degrees, we are able to see some correlation. our data and graph for angle vs. time supports this claim.

different errors occurred throughout the experiment. random error occurred when we were using a stop watch to calculate the period of a pendulum. the error involved was that different people started and stopped the stop watch at different times, so we had to take averages of the values. to minimize this error, we first took multiple attempts per trial and took the average of all the values. the most efficient way that we minimized error was by replacing the stopwatches with photogates. this allowed for our data to be accurate and give us values that had less uncertainty. random error also occurred in measuring the angle. it was hard to tell if we were exactly at the angle we recorded to be at. in the future we could have used a more consistent method.

constraints that limited the generalizability of our results was the time we had. with more time we could collect more data and lower our uncertainty. this would allow for us to have more points on our graph and make our claims stronger.
