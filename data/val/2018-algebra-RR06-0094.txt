discussion:

the data we obtained helped us to answer the question, “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?” both the data and the graphed showed that there is a linear, directly proportional relationship between applied force and acceleration. this is shown through the equation; $f=m*a$. similarly, we can solve for acceleration and obtain the enhanced theoretical equation; $a=\frac{m_{hanging} g}{m_{sys}} +\frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ . the graph (figure 3) shows our equation to be $y=0.0045 x +0.028$. the constant in our experiment should be equal to 1/m , which is the theoretical value of 0.0053. our actual constant was slightly lower (0.0045) which could be due to the uncertainty value of the air tract or friction not accounted for. we consulted two other groups in our lab to compare values for the constants. for this comparison, we multiplied our constant by 1000 because we are now in kg and not g. we also used the general mathematical model $y=c1 x + c2$. here is the data for both groups is 

our equation is  $y=4.5 x+0.028$




the theoretical  value is equal to 1/mass of system (kg). our theoretical value was 5.33 . our actual  value was 4.5 . our theoretical value was almost the exact same as group 1. our value from our graph was more similar to group 2. we had a value of 0.028 and they had a value of 0.037. group 1 had a significantly smaller  value. finally, the external force (n) is equal to *.  our external force was 0.006n. this value was similar to both groups 1 and 2. our original prediction was accurate. we predicted there would be a linear relationship, and there was. constraints in our experiment included the amount of force(n) we could test on our system. we only had a certain number of bobbers and if we had more, we could further test our hypothesis.  another constraint we had was amount of space. we had a certain distance on our air track device and we could not go above that distance. if we had more space, we could most likely get more accurate results. these constraints will affect the generalizability of our results because the data points are constrained to certain values. we could have greater generalizability with less restraints.
