	the results from lab 05 show that force affects acceleration as originally hypothesized. graph 1 is very close to the prediction made in the experimental design template at the beginning of lab 05. the linear relationship of $a=4.3797 x$ fits the theoretical model from the prediction. the data from groups 2 and 3 support our data as well, however group 3 did use grams as the calculation for force which resulted in a very different equation. this equation, however was still linear and fit the mathematical model as well. the theoretical model for this experiment was  

	in our mathematical model of $a=4.3797 x$, x is representative of m1g. the y intercept of .002 is representative of . this represents the constant mass of the system which was necessary as a control variable to avoid skewing results and having unnecessary calculation errors. when conducting the challenge experiment with the heavier sled to further understand force applied we were able to conclude that the heavier sled required more force applied to accelerate which would lead to the assumption that a lighter sled or string would require less force to accelerate. there are a few spots in this experiment that could lead to error. one such spot was in the measurement of the masses of the bobbers and the sled. if there was an error in the calibration of the scale it could have impacted the force applied value, however, the scale was not recalibrated during the experiment, so this was a systematic error and effected all results equally. another systematic error was that of the friction between the sled and the track. we calculated our results as if there was no friction because the track had air holes to slightly lift the sled and minimize friction, however, one could assume that a small amount of friction would still be present. this would have led to a smaller acceleration value. to reduce these systematic errors, one should make sure all lab equipment is properly calibrated and try to calculate the force of friction to see if it is statistically significant.

	this experiment was limited with the time involved, with two hours not being quite enough time to properly compare results with other groups and examine why mathematical models might be different. extra time would have also allowed the groups to run more trials to find a more accurate mathematical model.
