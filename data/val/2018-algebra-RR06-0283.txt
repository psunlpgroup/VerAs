discussion and conclusion: 

	the purpose of this lab experiment was to test the relationship between the mass and force of a hanging and acceleration.  from our graph shown above we received our experimental model as $y=0.0025 x + 0.3176$. our model presents f-hanging as x, 0.0025 represents            (1/m-system), + 0.3176 represents (f-unknown/ m-system), and y represents a. the theoretical model written in the form of our experimental model can be written as                 $a=\frac{x}{m}+\frac{f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$. with this model we are able to test any data point along the lines of our research question by plugging in an unknow/ hanging amount and solving for the, a, value which is acceleration. the theoretical model indicates there is a positive relationship between the applied force and the acceleration of the object. this makes sense because the applied force is equal to mass *acceleration. since the mass doesnâ€™t change, the acceleration must increase to compensate for the applied force as stated by newtons second law ($f= m a$). in our experiment the mass of the string was negligible but does actually have an effect on the acceleration. this is because as more of the string passes through the rolling dial it becomes part of the hanging mass, therefore increasing the hanging mass and acceleration. because of the string the system would not have uniform acceleration. two other groups conclusions stated below also agree with our final conclusion that as the hanging mass increases so does acceleration.
