discussion and conclusion

the purpose of lab 05 was to determine if mass has an impact on an object’s acceleration. we determined a mathematical model to observe if there was a relationship between these two variables. the purpose of lab 06 was to determine if any outside factors will impact the acceleration of a car traveling on an air track with a constant mass. 

after running trials to test the impact of cart mass, hanging mass, and magnetism on an object’s acceleration, the data was recorded for each individual factor. it was then plotted in a graph where the acceleration was the dependent variable (the y value) and the independent factor (cart mass, hanging mass, or magnetism) was the independent variable (the x value). once the data was plotted, the line of best fit was chosen for the graph. referring to figure 1, it is noticeable that the data follows a negative, curved trend for the cart mass. this indicated that the line of best fit would be a power curve. therefore, the equation for the mathematical model contained an exponential value. as for figure 2, it is evident that the data follows a positive, linear trend for the hanging mass. therefore, the mathematical model is a linear equation. lastly, figure 6 shows that each of the different quantities of magnets produce a positive, linear trend as well. the conclusion we can draw from figure 1 is that as mass of the system is constant, the increase in force causes an increase in acceleration. similarly, as the mass of the cart increases, the acceleration decreases. as for figure 2, we can conclude that as mass decreases, acceleration increases. lastly, figure 6 indicates that as magnetic force is increased and mass is held constant, acceleration decreases. concludingly, the y-intercept decreases as magnets are added because they produce an eddy current that causes an opposing force to the motion of the cart. 

	to the left is group one’s data, which displays the impact of forward tilt of the track on acceleration. their data concludes that as forward tilt is increased, acceleration increases. a graph of their model would indicate that as forward tilt increases, the y-intercept would increase. their graph would also contain parallel, positive, and linear trends with increasing y-intercepts. in comparison to figure 6, their data is opposite of that of magnetic influence. that is, when magnetic force is increased, the y-intercept and acceleration decreases. however, when comparing group one’s data to the data we obtained, the two analyses would be similar to one another. however, this is an error on my group’s part, because our y-intercepts are increasing when they should be decreasing as magnetic force is increased. furthermore, we reviewed our instructor’s data, which is represented in figure 6. this is the same experiment that my group conducted, which was magnetic influence on acceleration. figure 6 indicates parallel, positive, and linear trends with decreasing y-intercepts. however, our data displays parallel, positive, and linear trends with increasing y-intercepts. as stated earlier, this is because the scale of the x-axis is incorrect, and our data is scattered. however, if we would have increased the number of trials performed, our data would more likely be more accurate.

	some systematic error that may have occurred would have been if too much weight was added to the cart. if too much weight is added, then the track that is supposed to be frictionless may gain some kinetic friction. to reduce this error, minimal weight was added; for example, bobbers were used instead of metal weights. some random error that may have occurred would be if the cart was not released from the exact same length every trial. another random error that may have occurred would be if the datastudio program had a glitch.

	a constraint in this experiment was the inability to attach the magnets in a secure position to the cart in lab 06. in some instances, the magnets fell off on impact with the rotary motion sensor, forcing us to repeat many trials. 

	the two experimental mathematical models are consistent with newton’s second law. this is because they both show a relationship between force, the mass of a system and acceleration. according to figure 1, if the mass of the system is held constant, but the force is increased, acceleration will increase. according to figure 2, if the hanging mass is increased then the acceleration was increased.
