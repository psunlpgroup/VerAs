discussion & conclusion: 



the purpose of this lab was to explore how the force applied to an object effects its acceleration. the independent variable of the experiment was the force of the object, or the hanging mass, and the dependent variable was the acceleration. my group predicted that the two would have a linear relationship and as the hanging mass increased, so would the acceleration. this was an accurate prediction as can be seen in graph 1. during lab 6, we compared our findings with other groupsâ€™ and found that overall, the data and hypotheses were similar. the first group we compared our findings to, found in data table 2, had a similar hypothesis and had the same control variable which was the mass of the system, or the number of bobbers total. the second group we compared our data to, data table 3, also mentioned gravity and tension as control variables, which although my group did not, the data was not affected. both groups had similar data points and an uncertainty of .001, as did we. 

during week 5, an experimental and theoretical model was identified. the theoretical model was is  $m a=m g-friction$, whereas the experimental model was $y= 0.2309 x + .0785$, where x is  the number of bobbers, and y is acceleration. both of these confirmed that the relationship between the force applied and acceleration is linear. error in this experiment was systematic, which was due to the string having been tied and could have added friction to the system. in week 6, we were given a goal acceleration and needed to calculate what hanging mass would get us as close as possible to that value. my group was given a goal acceleration of 0.45 m/s and the equation $a= \frac{m_{hang} g}{m_{sys}}- \frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. through this equation, my group calculated that a hanging mass of .016174 kilograms was required. because each bobber weighed about .005 kilograms, we chose to use 3 bobbers and the acceleration was 0.46 m/s, which was within the range of acceptable values. although this experiment allowed us to explore the initial research question, there were still a few limitations such as friction and air resistance, which could not be controlled but were nonetheless still present, a limited track length, and only certain increments of weight could be added to the system.
