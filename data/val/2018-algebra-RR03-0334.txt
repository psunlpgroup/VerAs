discussion and conclusion:  



    the purpose of this lab was to find which variables, out of mass, length, and angle of release, affect the time it takes for the pendulum to complete one full oscillation. this lab consisted of three main experiments and two other experiments that help make the data collected more accurate, the results of all five experiments helped answer the research question. the first experiment tested the mass, to see if it affected the time it took to complete a full oscillation. as shown in tables 1 and 5, the angle of release (15) and the length of the string (52.7cm) were kept constant because they were the control variables. since the mass was the independent variable, the masses were changed and the time it took to complete five oscillations was measured for each mass using a stopwatch. because time was being measured, it was the dependent variable. the angle of release versus time experiment, as seen in tables 2 and 6, was carried out similarly to the mass versus time experiment. in the angle versus time experiment, the length of the string (42cm) and the mass of the bob (50g) were kept constant because they were the control variables. the time of oscillations was measured at different angles of release making the angles of release the independent variable and times the dependent variable. in this experiment, the angle was measured by hand using a protractor, and the time was measured using a manual stopwatch. like the previous two experiments, the first length versus time experiment, as found in tables 3 and 7, was conducted with the angle of release (15) and the mass of the bob (250g) staying constant as the control variables. the time of oscillation was measured using different lengths of string. the length was the independent variable which was measured using a tape measure and the times were the dependent variable, measured using a manual stopwatch. 

    the data collected in mass vs. time experiment was very scattered (refer to figure 1), there was no visible line of best fit, indicating that there was no relationship between the mass of the pendulum and the time it takes the pendulum to make a full oscillation. since the true value of a measurement can never be known for sure, all measured values will have some level of uncertainty associated with them. this uncertainty value is usually represented by error bars, this means that the true value of the measurement falls somewhere within the error bars, but it does not necessarily have to be the exact value of the data point. even with the uncertainty range (one sigma) added via the error bars (0.01841s), there is no distinct pattern within the data, a line of best fit cannot be drawn through each of the data points or their error bars. the equivalency criterion further supports the conclusion that the timing of the oscillations is not affected by the mass of the pendulum. when the error bars are doubled in quantity (two sigma) a horizontal line can be drawn through all of the data points, this means that the data points are not distinct. in other words, as the mass of the pendulum is changed, there is no significant change found in the time it takes to complete one full oscillation. the absence of a trend line indicates that there is no correlation between the mass of the bob and the time it takes to complete an oscillation. the final conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that the mass of the bob should not affect the time it takes to complete an oscillation. this result does fit the theoretical model.

    the data from the angle versus time experiment is graphed in figure 2 and shown in table 6. the error bars (0.01841s) represent the standard deviation of the time measurements (found in the fourth experiment), also known as one sigma. increasing the size of the error bars to two sigma can check the equivalency criterion. if the error bars were to be doubled in length, a horizontal line could not be drawn through all of the data points, this shows that all of the data points are distinct measurements and that there is relationship present between the angle and time. the graphed representation of the data shows a linear line of best fit. based on the results of this experiment, there is a relationship between the angle of release and the time it takes to complete an oscillation. the data suggests a positive correlation between the angle and the time, this means that the angle at which the pendulum is released should affect the time it takes the pendulum to make a full oscillation. however, results from previous studies, on the same experiment, differ from the results of this experiment. based on the mathematical theory, the angle of release should not affect the oscillation time, that is why the angle of release does not have a variable in the theoretical equation. some factors that could have skewed the data from this experiment would be the angles tested. the mathematical model that was used to compare this data to was specific for small angles, so the use of large angles could result in data that shows a correlation between angle and time. another reason for the differing results could be random error, if the angles were not measured accurately and precisely, the results would be affected. lastly, the small data sample might have resulted in skewed data; conducting multiple trials for each of the different angles could have helped reduce the random error. since that data sample is so small, it is less reliable, less precise. in conclusion, the results of the angle vs. time experiment show that there is a relationship between the angle of release and the time it takes to complete an oscillation. however, it is also important to keep in mind that the data from this experiment is not the most reliable, it could have been subject to many random errors. thus, these results do not support the theoretical model.

    the length vs time experiment tested if the length of the pendulum affected the time it takes to complete a full oscillation. the results of this experiment can be found in table 7 and graphed in figure 3. the graph shows that the data does have a line of best fit, but it is not linear. the line of best fit for the length versus time graph fits a power model, the equation is as follows is  $y=0.1230915 x$. this means that the length of the pendulum (measured by the length of the string) will affect the time it takes to complete a full oscillation. the mathematical model for the pendulum is also a power model, this indicates that there should be a relationship between the length of the pendulum and the timing of the oscillations. the equivalency criterion can be used to further support the conclusion being drawn. the error bars (0.01841s) for this graph were based on the standard deviation of the time measurements (found in the fourth experiment), which was one sigma. when the error bars are doubled in value (two sigma) a horizontal line cannot be drawn through all of the data points, meaning each point is distinct and there is some kind of relationship between the two variables that were tested. the data collected in this experiment does follow the theoretical model.

    since the true value can never be measured (accurately), there is always a level of uncertainty associated they any data collected. the fourth experiment was conducted to find the level of uncertainty in the previous three experiments. the level of uncertainty was found but keeping all of the variables previously used as independent variables, constant. this means that the angle of release (15°), the mass (50g), and the length (32cm) were all kept constant, they were used as control variables. in a perfect world, the timing of the oscillation should have all been the same. however, in this world, there is always room for error, and this experiment will help find the level of uncertainty created by the error. as expected the times recorded for this experiment did vary. the variation of the timing shows the uncertainty associated with the measurement technique. the standard deviation of this data set provided the level of uncertainty for the previous three experiment, as shown via the error bars. in the angle vs time, mass vs time, and the length vs time experiment the time was measured by hand (using a stopwatch), meaning the measurements were not always accurate. the level of uncertainty represents a range within which the true value of the measured time should fall. 

    the fifth and final experiment was conducted to double check the accuracy of the results from the length vs time experiment. this experiment was conducted the same way the first length vs time experiment was, the only changes were that the control angle was 10° instead of 15°, and the time was measured using a photogate (table 9). the use of the photogate significantly increased the accuracy and precision of the time reading of the oscillations, this is true because the photogate has an uncertainty value of 0.001s, whereas the stopwatch used before had an uncertainty of 0.01841s. the possibility of any potential errors in reading the time of oscillations was significantly reduced by using the photogate. the error bars are set based on the level of uncertainty, which is one sigma (figure 4). to test the equivalency criterion, the error bars must be doubled to two sigma. however, with this data set, even after the error bars are doubled, a horizontal line will not be able to cross through the error bars of all of the points. this means that the value of each data point is distinct and that there is some sort of relationship present between the two variables tested. the results of this experiment were very similar to those of the first length vs time experiment. this supports the theoretical model and our initial results, that there is a significant relationship between the length of the pendulum and the time it takes to complete one full oscillation. 

    the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, which is in the form of a power model. the pendulum theory also indirectly shows that the angle and mass of the pendulum should not affect the time of oscillations. the lines of best fit in both the length versus time graphs are also power models.  the c1 and c2 values from the length vs time graphs are very similar to those of the theoretical model. the c1 value in the theoretical mathematical model is 0.2005, the c1 value from the original length vs time graph is 0.285, and 0.2598 for the second length vs time experiment. the c2 values are similar also, ½ for the theoretical model, 0.4319 for the original length vs time data, and 0.4387 for the second length vs time experiment. both of these similarities show that the data obtained from this experiment fits the theoretical model. the mass versus time experiment shows no correlation between the two variables, this also supports the theoretical model. the results of the angle vs time graph deviate from the theoretical model, this data shows a linear line of best fit which is not similar to the power line of the theoretical model. however, this could be attributed to random errors that occurred when this experiment was conducted. 

    there were some opportunities for error in this experiment. specifically more random errors than systematic like when the measurements were made by the researchers, the researchers could have misread the measuring tools leading to a random error. delays in starting and stopping the stopwatch led to random error when measuring the time. the photogate helped reduce the random error when measuring time because it was more precise and accurate than a human using a stopwatch. a possible systematic error could have occurred if the tape measure was stretched from overuse or if the protractor used to measure the angle was bent. this could be corrected by getting a new tape measure or protractor then comparing the difference in measurements, and correcting the data. 

    some factors that limit the generalization of the results would be the amount of data collected. for some of the experiments such as the mass versus time and angle versus time, there were not many data points collected. as mentioned earlier, a small data sample can be unreliable. the best way to fix or address this issue in upcoming experiments would be to collect more data by conducting more trials for each variable.
