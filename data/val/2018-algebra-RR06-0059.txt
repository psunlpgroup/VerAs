discussion and conclusions



the purpose of this lab was to determine how the applied force on a system (in this case an air cart, a pulley, and a hanging mass) can affect its acceleration and to determine a mathematical model for this relationship, if any. this experiment was conducted by varying the applied force on a system of constant mass, and this data is summarized in both table 2 and figure 1. also in figure 1 is the determined mathematical model, $a=4.8642 F + 0.0106$ . this model is very similar to the one found by group 6, which was $a= 4.873 f+0.0077$. not only were our slopes and y-intercepts very close, group 6 also presented a linear model, which supported our own findings of a linear model. group 1 too suggested a linear model—again corroborating our data—but their slope and y-intercept varied slightly from the numbers we found is  they suggested that $=5.25 f +0.06$, still close to our values, but less so than group 6. the equations and graphs of both these groups are presented as figures 2 and 3.

although these two groups had similar equations to our own, we all deviated somewhat from the theoretical model which would have been $a=5.288 f$. this is derived from newton’s second law $F=ma$,  which can be manipulated into $a=\frac{1}{m} f$  where m is .1891 kg and inverse of m is 5.288. what is noteworthy is that all the experimental models provide a y-intercept other than 0, whereas the theoretical model indicates the graph should cross the y-axis at exactly 0. this y-intercept represents the frictional force acting on the cart, opposite the direction of motion and the applied force. an enhanced theoretical model would be $a=5.288 f -f $  where f is the force of friction acting opposite the applied force of the hanging mass, but we presently have no way to calculate , as we do not know the coefficient of friction along the air track. nevertheless, this enhanced theoretical model more closely matches our experimental model as it gives a nonzero y-intercept and accounts for the effects of friction, which our original theoretical model ignored.



what cannot be as easily explained in our experimental model is how the slope differs from the theoretical slope of 5.288, or  where m is the mass of the entire system (.1891 kg). it is possible that our slope differs from the theoretical value due to the fact our string was not entirely massless. this would, of course, increase the total mass of our system, but such an effect should decrease the slope rather than increase it. instead, we suggest that the mass of the string positively affects the applied force on the cart and thus makes the actual applied force greater than what we calculated (a larger slope) and makes the acceleration of the cart no longer entirely uniform, as it would increase as more of the string falls over the pulley and begins to contribute to the applied force. these reasons, combined with air resistance and the friction of the pulley, explain why our slope differed from the theoretical slope.



possible sources of error include the random error associated with how data studio calculates the acceleration of our cart is  it gives the average slope of the selected region of a velocity-time graph. since it is entirely possible that we did not select every single data point within our region of interest, our calculated acceleration may have varied somewhat from the actual average acceleration across this entire duration. due to the heavy string and the non-uniformity of the cart’s acceleration, the direction of this error depends on whether early or late data points were accidentally neglected, and it is thus considered a random error. this could be reduced by meticulously verifying that every single data point was selected. 

potential sources of systematic error include air resistance (always opposes movement so would result in measured accelerations lowered than expected) and the air track being not exactly level (downward slope-> higher accelerations, upward slope-> lower accelerations). air resistance could be eliminated by conducting this experiment in a vacuum and any issues regarding the levelness of the air track could be removed by checking it with a level.

as with any experiments, constraints were present. first and foremost, data was only collected with a single system mass that also happened to be incredibly low. it is possible (but unlikely) that at substantially greater or lesser masses our experimental model no longer holds true. additionally, only one data point was taken for each set of forces and accelerations, so any random or human error would have been carried throughout and impacted the linear model at the end. to truly verify the theoretical model, a similar experiment would have to be conducted in a frictionless vacuum and with a different method of generating a precise and immutable constant force.
