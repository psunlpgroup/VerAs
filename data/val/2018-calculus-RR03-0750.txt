discussion and conclusion

the research question for this lab was “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?”

the first experiment addressed the research question by determining what factors, or independent variables, have and impact on the period of a pendulum. in this experiment, an independent variable was selected, then tested over a series of lengths as the period was observed and recorded. the results were then graphed to determine whether a relationship existed between the variables. the graphs in figures 2 and 3 of period v. mass and period v. angle of release demonstrated no relationship, since the equivalency criterion does not demonstrate the values between data points to be significantly different. however, the graph of period v. length in figure 1 does demonstrate statistically significant differences between its data values, and so there is a correlation between the period of a pendulum and its length.

the second experiment addressed error. drawing and the use of error bars and the equivalency criterion were established, which allowed the data from the first experiment to be analyzed more thoroughly. the possibility of random and systematic errors was also introduced, and carefully considering these possible errors allowed better data to be taken obtained more carefully, both in this experiment and in the future.

finally, the purpose of the third experiment was to create a mathematical model reflecting what variables determine the period of a pendulum. in this experiment, we addressed the research question just as in the first experiment, but the approach to answering the question was different.

the theoretical model for the period of a pendulum is  . our model,  , closely reflects the constant term for the equation () but our exponent was rather off. it should have been .5 in theory, creating a square root, but in our model it was only 0.3948. curve fitting in excel was used to find the equation of the graph of average period v. length (figure 5), which yielded the equation of our theoretical model. our experimental model does reflect the theoretical model, in that they both contain the same variables. both show the impact of length alone on the period of the pendulum, and nothing else. consistent with our findings, mass and angle of release are not included in the theoretical equation to find the period of a pendulum.

there were several random errors which occurred over the course of our experimentation. for example, while we were collecting data for the period v. angle of release graph (figure 3), our timekeeper had to leave to go to her class. another lab partner stepped up and took her place, but the inconsistences from this switch (which could come from differences in reaction times, subtle tweaks in measuring methods, etc.). in the future, keeping lab partners assigned to consistent tasks will help to limit the amount of random error.

also, human error is an area that consistently creates random errors in lab. for example, small changes in reaction time and inconsistencies in measurements or taking readings all decrease the precision of results. running multiple trials and then averaging the values reduces random errors in data due to human error. using instruments such as the photogate, which eliminate the possibility for human error by precise readings independently of human involvement. however, as with all instruments, there is a limit to the precision that can be achieved.

systematic errors in our results could have occurred due to improperly calibrated instruments (such as the photogate, tape measure, protractor, etc.).

our experiments reflect the results of one pendulum, in one lab. if we wanted to find the true theoretical model for the period of a pendulum experimentally, we would need to perform many, many more trials over many, many more experiments. our results only have a small amount of data to support them, and those results should be regarded as such. they are not invalid for this reason, but they are not strongly supported either. it should be considered that there is room for improvement and adjustment before we would arrive at the theoretical model.
