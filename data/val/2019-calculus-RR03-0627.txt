discussion and conclusion

what are the factors that affect the period of a pendulum?



the first experiment that was executed to observe the factors in a period of a pendulum was the mass vs. period experiment. one possible component of a period is the mass of the pendulum. however, a claim that the mass of the pendulum does not affect the period, was made. this was tested by using a variety of different masses when swinging the pendulum. the data that was collected from these tests seemingly supported the claim of the mass of the pendulum’s irrelevance to the period. in figure 3, there is no explicit correlation between the mass and period of the pendulum. however, a best fit line could be drawn on the graph to see a positive correlation between the mass and period. this implies that there is some relation between the mass and period of the pendulum. 

the second experiment conducted was the length of string vs. period experiment. a claim was made that as the length of string attached to the pendulum increases, the period of the pendulum will increase as well. this was tested by swinging a pendulum with different lengths of string. the period was recorded for the different lengths. the data collected from this experiment supports the claim of the string length’s relationship with the period. figure 6 reflects the data collected and shows a linear relationship between these two variables. there is an explicit, positive correlation of length of string and period of a pendulum. figure 6 shows as string length increases, the period will increase along with it. 

the third experiment conducted was the angle vs. period experiment. a claim was made that as the angle of release increases, the period of the pendulum will increase as well. this claim was tested by swinging a pendulum at different angles. the period of these different swings were recorded in order to observe the relationship between the angle and period. the data collected from this experiment does not support the claim of the angle of release’s positive correlation with the period of the pendulum. in figure 9, the data shows that there is no correlation between these two variables. 

the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is $t=1.99 l^{0.5}$. my group’s data from the length vs. period experiment is in close proximity of this model. the equation that my group came up with was $t=0.31 l^{0.4061}$. in this equation, the variable t represents the period in seconds and l represents the length of string attached to the pendulum. my group’s equation was calculated by using figure 8. a line was able to be formed from the data collected to create figure 8. the slope of this line represents the function of the period of the pendulum. a line could not be formed using the angle vs. period graph because the data is too spread out and not correlated. although the mass vs. period graph showed a positive correlation, the data was still too spread out to depict an accurate representation of a period of a pendulum. the length vs. period graph was the best graph to use because the linear relationship was explicit and the line was well drawn out. this allows the line to be close to the theoretical model. 

in these experiments, random errors were prominent. when recording the period of these experiments, the numbers were not exact and they were spread out. recording more periods could prevent random errors in the future by gathering a large set of data to calculate the average. the average of this data is better because it contains more data to accommodate the randomness of the numbers derived from recording the periods. 

the major constraint in this experiment was the limited data used to calculate the average period. in terms of quantity, the data used was not sufficient enough to minimize random errors. the limited data lead to the results of the experiment to be not very generalized and only limited to the little data that was gathered. in order to improve the generalizability of my group’s results, my group should have gathered more data to minimize random errors.
