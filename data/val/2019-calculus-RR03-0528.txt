discussion and conclusion:	

	the goals of the first three labs were to test how changes in different variables affect the time it takes a pendulum to complete one period. as the mass of the pendulum was increased it showed a very minimal or null change between the weights. this leads to the conclusion that weight does not influence the time it takes the pendulum to complete a period. the length data shows that when the length is increased the period becomes longer with a decreasing slope, or smaller change between each length. the data eludes to the conclusion that the length of the string does influence the period of the pendulum, the longer the string the longer the period length is. the first test of drop angle showed a minimal increase as the angle increased, but the error test in lab two showed that the change was significant enough to consider it changing. the conclusion that can be drawn from angle testing is that the larger the angle is the longer it takes the pendulum to complete a period. the equation for the period of a pendulum would be a power equation because the slope is decreasing as the values increase. the last lab best represents this data because you can clearly see the change in slope while the r squared value is the closest to one. the errors that came with the original testing came with imperfections in the timing for the tests. this is proven by the lab 3 test where the computer timer was used and shows more consistent and reliable data. another error that could be used is off axis swings or air resistance which can be difficult to be accounted for, along with friction of the string on the hanging arm. the constraints of the equation are the materials of the pendulum because we were only given one type of pendulum and only one type of string to hang with. the constraints were also limited because of the tools of measurement we were given, timer, ruler, and a protractor. these affect the results because they make it more limited on the types of variables that can be tested lending to the results being consistent between tests.
