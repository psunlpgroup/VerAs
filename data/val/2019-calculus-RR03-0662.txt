conclusion:
Entering this experiment, it was our goal to find what factors affect the period of a pendulum. Each experiment we tested one of three values being mass of weight, length of pendulum and the angle of release. First was length of string, when we recorded our values we had received and entered them into a graph the result came out with a very linear, positive correlation. Before we had started the experiment, we had predicted that the length of the string would affect the period of the pendulum and seeing from the data set it seemed that we were correct in having that prediction. The second factor we tested was mass. Our values for the mass versus period varied a little bit but there was no positive or negative correlation between the two. We had predicted that the mass would affect the period length of a pendulum and according to the graph of our data points and the almost horizontal slope it appeared that we had made the wrong prediction. The third and final factor we tested was angle of release. We took the values we had received and put them into a graph. The data points had a weak linear slope in the positive direction. We had predicted that angle of release would affect the period of the pendulum and from the graph it looked as if we had might been correct, but the size of the error made us unsure.



The theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum as shown above is affected by only two variables which are gravity represented by g and length of the pendulum which is represented by L. This coincides with the data we found from our experiment and the length of the pendulum had a strong linear, positive correlation with the time of the period which it also does in the equation for the period of a pendulum. Our findings with the mass also makes sense in the context of the equation as mass has zero effect on length of period in the equation and the correlation of the data we had found represented in our graph was virtually zero. Angle of release also isn’t included in the theoretical equation because it has such a minuscule effect on the length of the period if one at all and this is supported by our findings since the relationship between length of period and angle of release wasn’t very strong and most likely only had a positive slope do to errors that we had made during the testing of this factor.
During the experiment errors were present when we were recording our data. These errors were random errors, many of factors could have played into data recording errors. Some of these errors could be human error when we used the stop watches to record the time of the periods as we couldn’t click the stop button at the exact time when a period ended or the start button exactly when the pendulum is released. We tried to resolve this issue by using a photogate which is a more accurate way to measure time as it takes more human error out of the equation. Another random error would be the imperfect way of measuring the angle of release. With the fact that we couldn’t release the pendulum at the exact angle that we would have liked. Also, when the pendulum is released there could be some variability of the drop if it moves to the right or left a bit and maybe hits the protractor that we were measuring with or the stand that we were using. One way to limit this problem is to program a robot to release the pendulum at the exact angle that we were trying to obtain.
This experiment also came with some constrictions as we couldn’t make the length of the pendulum extremely long or short do to the restrictions of the room and the materials we were using. We also couldn’t use any heavier or lighter weights then the ones we were given. Without these restrictions it would have made it much easier to see the relationships of the factors we were testing as the results would be more extreme and we would have the opportunity to take more data points if we didn’t have a time restriction on the lab time we could perform this experiment in.
