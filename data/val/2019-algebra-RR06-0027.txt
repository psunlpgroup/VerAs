discussion and conclusion

in labs 05 and 06 that were completed across the past weeks we sought to find how the acceleration of a cart is affected by both the applied force and the applied friction. in lab 05 specifically we tested the effects of hanging weight on the acceleration. through repeated trials we were able to find that as the hanging weight increased, the acceleration increased proportionately. meaning that both the independent and dependent variables correlate positively. lab 05 graph 1 shows the recorded data points along with error bars. these bars show the standard deviation for the set of data so that we can better analyze our findings. as can be seen from the graph, all data points fall within these error bars which allows us to conclude that our collected data was very accurate. when looking at data that another group had collected, we found that they had a very similar graph to ours. the same positive correlation was present, yet they had a smaller standard deviation than our own, meaning that they had more conclusive data. when calculating the acceleration, we used the equation $f=m a$. our experimental model supported this model because as the force increased, so did the acceleration. when testing how more than one force effected the system, we used the equation $a=c1 x+c2$. this equation allowed us to test for both friction and the applied force and see how they change the acceleration of the cart. the experimental model was supported by the theoretical model because they both showed that the friction did not affect the acceleration, but the applied force did. if the experiment were conducted using a rope that had noticeable mass instead of thin string, we would find that the acceleration would increase as the cart went down the track. this is a result of the increased applied force provided by the rope as it is let out. as more rope is pulled down the hanging mass increases causing the acceleration to also increase. it is possible that our readings could have been off due to a few different factors. there was random error due to the fact that we conducted the experiment ourselves. this could have resulted from misplacing the cart on the track, starting the data recording at the wrong time, or by bumping the track while testing. we had systematic error in the form of a knot in the string that caused our data to fluctuate from trial to trial. these could be reduced by remotely controlling the system so that trials are repeated identical each time. the systematic error could have been reduced if there were another string available at the time. there were constraints in this experiment that effect its generalizability. these include primarily the materials used. the nearly frictionless track and cart contributed greatly to our easily observable results.
