discussion and conclusion

for this experiment, newton’s laws were investigated upon through the testing of a hanging mass’ effect on acceleration.  these experiments allowed for a conclusion to be drawn that indicates that the larger hanging mass, the faster the acceleration when the total mass of the system is constant.  as for the models used for this experiment, $f=m a$ and $m g=m a$, they relate to the experiment since the graph, graph 1, is acceleration over mass which is in short force.  since this experiment is done on earth, there is also the issue of gravity which is factored into the second equation.  our resulting model was $y=0.503 x-0.0221$.


listed above are findings of two other groups (figure 1 & 2).  group 1’s model turned out to be $y=0.0053 x-0.0306$ (group 1, 2018).  meanwhile the model for group 5’s is $y=0.0045 x$ so $y=0.0699$ (group 5, 2018).  of course, the y represents the acceleration while x is an equative to force.  each of these models varies from the model that was configured from the results of this experiment as well as each other.  the only thing similar is the negative amount that represents the frictional force that is happening within the system.

as previously mentioned, the other force besides hanging weight that is present in this experiment is friction.  it is represented in the equation as the amount that is subtracted in the theoretical and current mathematical model.  the mass of the system shows up in the model as m, which is the mass of the system congruent upon all the bobbins, and cart added together to account for where all the mass comes from.  with that being said, a massless string will not add to the total mass of the system, and will not increase as the hanging mass pulls down and will not aid in the increase of acceleration due to it which causes a nonuniform acceleration.

the possibility of errors in this experiment were the inevitable time that the vacuum for the air track was not turned off on time which allowed for the acceleration to be measured time, and instead the second measurement, as well as the measurement of mass of the total system.  these errors were taken into consideration by double checking the scale measurements as well as adding the separate masses together, trying for better reaction times, and rerunning the trial if something went awry.

generalizability of this experiment’s results is limited due to several constraints.  one of the constraints of this experiment is the low amount of trials, which may be improved through adding more bobbins to the experiments.  another way to improve is to repeat each trial more than once to get a better average for accuracy’s sake.  the final constraint was the consistent use of one system mass.  there could have been a greater chance to encourage the trend saw in the data was consistent across all systems of various masses.
