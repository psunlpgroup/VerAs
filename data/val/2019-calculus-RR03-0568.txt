discussion and conclusion

the research question being investigated in this lab was what impacts the period of the pendulum and was tested through three different independent variables.

all three experiments were conducted to answer the research question. the first experiment was done to give the user a thought on how each independent variable might affect the period of the pendulum. after the first one, it was claimed that length influenced the period. looking at the length versus period graph with the error bars shows that the change is very clear and showed that as length increased, period also increased. the claim made from this data was that the length had a direct impact on the period of the pendulum. looking at the mass versus period graph with the error bars shows that the change was virtually negligible, and the claim was that it had no effect on the experiment. the only variable that was in question was the angle at which the weight on the string was released. looking at the graph with error bars, it was tough to make any distinct determination on the effect it had on the experiment. there was significant uncertainty since stop watches were used to determine the time of one swing and the results were inaccurate. after this experiment on the first day, due to a high uncertainty, the team determined that there was no impact from the angle. this claim would be reversed as the labs progressed and more accurate measurements were made. the second experiment addressed the research question by adding the error bars to the graphs to show the slope of the line more clearly after calculating the uncertainty, as shown earlier in the report. this experiment also considered the errors which would have wrongly impacted the lab and the overall results. the third experiment addressed the research question by clarifying the variable of angle. this experiment was far more accurate since a photogate was used to determine time, which a far more precise and accurate way to measure period. the results stayed consistent with the observation of the other two variables and their impacts, while also determining that the angle does affect the period in a very miniscule way, at the angle gets bigger, the period also gets a little bigger. the claim from the final experiment was that angle has a small impact on the period of the pendulum. 

 the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum was determined to be  $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ where t stands for time. the data fits this model since mass and angle are virtually negligible, the only variable that matters for this is the length of the string. since they are negligible, they are not included in the model. the graphs and data tables all show these claims are all true, even in the graphs where the results were largely inaccurate, the general idea is still there. this equation was found using the line of best fit on excel for the graph of length of the string versus the period of the pendulum. 

one of the errors which was present in this lab was the delayed release of pendulum. this led to the start of the inaccurate results when the stopwatch had to be used, because the exact moment it was released was very difficult to determine. this leads into the point of a potential slow or premature reaction to timing the swing, both where it started and where it finished. this was the most prominent issue as many attempts of the same trial run would have to be done as a result of extremely inaccurate usage of the stopwatch. the way this error was reduced is three of the team members took the time of the pendulum and then the results were averaged to get the most accurate result. this led to the most accurate results because it helped reduce the person who may have been way off. it also showed the degree of error in using a stop watch as the results were rarely the same between the stopwatches. a third error which was seen in this experiment was the string would swing diagonally causing correct measurements to be altered. it was difficult to make the string completely parallel to the stand which led to imperfect measurements and flawed results. this was reduced in the experiment by having someone looking from the opposite angle to help the person releasing the string to ensure that it is parallel to the stand.  a final error which was apparent in this experiment was the angle being a minuscule amount off the desired angle than what it was measured. this could be the same claim made with the length of the string as potential inaccurate results were determined due to human error. this could be reduced in the future by taking multiple measurements before and after the trial run to ensure the results are the same as measured before. 

some constraints in this that may have limited the generalizability of the results include the inaccuracy in the stopwatch or something small such as air resistance differing between the days which the experiment was completed. it may have affected the generalizability of the results in a negative manner, but shouldnâ€™t have shuffled the framework of the observations since the errors were available during all aspects of the experiment.
