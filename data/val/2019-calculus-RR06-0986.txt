conclusions

 we can into a random error when conducting this experiment of the string coming in contact with a piece of metal on the air track, this resulted in some trendlines of the acceleration that did not match the rest of the data. these data sets were remeasure to provide clarity and the were replace in the new data. after this error was discovered, we made sure to double check that the string was in the proper location before starting any trial. we also made a slight adjustment to the air track to further prevent this from happenening. a possible systematic error could come from how we start the trial. we would start with the air track off and then turn it on and allow for the pulley to start recording. this method could allow for different levels of friction as the air track is not properly filled with air when it first starts up. this error could be avoided in future experiments by building some device to start the trial only after the air is to a satisfactory level. but at this point i do not have and idea for how to do this. 

this experiment was limited in the amount of angle that could be added to the system. this may means that as the angle increases more drastically the trend that we observed near zero could not hold true. 

the mathematical model for experiment 1, $a = 0.003 m - 0.0111$ is consistent with newtonâ€™s second law because it takes the mass of the bobbers multiplied by the force of acceleration to get the force required to accelerate at a certain instant. the constant value can best be attributed to the force of friction. the mathematical model for experiment 2 is, $a = 5744.7 m^{-1.057}$. this is a power model, and because the exponent of this model is a negative value close to 1 that means it is essentially dividing the 5744 by the x. this means that the acceleration will decrease as the mass of the system increases, which makes sense as the same hanging mass would be required to pull and ever-increasing amount of mass.
