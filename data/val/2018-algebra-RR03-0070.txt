discussion and conclusion

during the course of three weeks, our group tested what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. specifically, we tested three different cases or independent variables that had the potential to affect the time it took for one period to occur. the three variables being tested were the length of the string, the mass of the pendulum bob and the angle of release. after collecting and analyzing the data, we can conclude that the one that affects the time it takes for one period to occur is the length of the string. we can see by looking at figure 1.1, that there is a direct relationship between the time it takes for a period to occur and the length of the string. the graph indicates that as the length of the string increases, so does the time it takes for one period to occur. we are able to see the definite correlation between length of string and the time it takes for a period to occur, and we can also see that the error bars are not prominent in the length of string graph showing that there is not a huge level of uncertainty associated with the data. as for the mass of the pendulum bob and the angle of release, we were able to conclude that these had no direct effect on the time it took for one period to occur. as we look at figure 1.2 and 1.3 the data seems to be very sporadic and an apparent trend between the variables is not present. we can also conclude that a correlation is not found between the variables due to the variability associated with each graph. both the mass of the pendulum bob and angle of release had error bars that were rather large, showing the level of uncertainty associated with the data. this solidifies, along with their r2 values that a relationship between the mass of a pendulum, the angle of release and the time it takes for a period to occur are non-existent.



by conducting this experiment, we were also able to discover the theoretical equation for the time it took for one period to occur. the theoretical equation is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$. when looking at figure 1.4, we can conclude that the data does support the theoretical equation due to the correlation and direct relationship between the length of the string and the time it took for one period to occur. by being able to use the photogate for this part of the experiment, we were able to obtain precise and accurate data that yielded us an r2  value of 0.9932 indicating a very strong relationship between our data, the variables and the theoretical equation. 



as with any research conducted, there are certain constraints and errors that should be identified and discussed to ensure that with future testing and even with current testing that these errors and constraints are able to be minimized. the most prominent random error throughout this entire three-week lab revolves around human error. the lab was heavily dependent on the abilities of humans to be accurate and precise with each and every trial. we had to be accurate and precise for measuring the exact length of the string, the exact angle of release each and every time, along with being able to properly and accurately judge when a period occurred by using a stopwatch. this heavy dependence on humans may have led to variability within the data especially with the times being collected due to our delayed reaction or slower than normal reaction to click the stopwatch button when we perceived a period on the pendulum had occurred. this random error is able to be minimized by repeating trials and being able to obtain an average that better represents the overall question. the more data that we were able to collect, the less our human errors were able to impact the data set. the major constraint that was identified during the experiment was the inability to collect data when the length of the string surpassed 200 cm. due to a spatial constraint of the classroom, we were only able to see the effects of the length of string up to 200 cm forcing us to generalize the relationship past that point. however, with using the photogate and our previous data collected, we were able to obtain a highly accurate and precise equation that would allow us to obtain extrapolated data, or data that was outside the constraints of our research still allowing us to conclude that the variable that directly affected the time for a period to occur was the length of the string.
