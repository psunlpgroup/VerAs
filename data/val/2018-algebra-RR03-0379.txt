	in this experiment, the research question being investigated was what variables will impact the period of the pendulum and which variables are negligible. three different variables were tested is  the angle at which the pendulum is released, the mass of the pendulum, and the length of the string. 

the first experiment tested was the impact of the angle of swing on the period of the pendulum. through the first experimental design plan, data table 4, and the first graph, the impact of angle of release was determined to be negligible. the r2 value of this graph was determined to be greater than 2 of the standard deviations which proves the angle of release is not an important factor in the period of the pendulum. the second experiment tested was the impact of the mass of the pendulum on the period of the pendulum,. through the second experimental design plan, data table 5, and the second graph, the impact of the mass of the pendulum was also determined to be negligible. even though the r2 value was closer to 1, it is still rendered negligible due to the slope of the line. it is nearly 0 which shows a practically horizontal line, proving that no matter the mass of the pendulum, the time of the swing would remain the same. this proves that the mass of the pendulum has no impact on the period of the pendulum.

the third variable tested was the length of the string in relation to the period of the pendulum. this is laid out in the third experimental design, sixth data chart, and the third graph. after testing 5 different data points, the relation between the length of the string and the time of the swing was a visible relationship. as the length of the string increased, the time it took for the pendulum to complete an entire period also increased. a second round of data points were ran to see if this relationship could be confirmed or disproved. this is shown in the seventh data table and fourth graph. this shows an even more distinct relationship between the length of the string and the period of the pendulum. it can be represented by the equation $y=0.63767732 x$. this can be related to the mathematical model equation $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ which directly relates the time of the swing to the length of the string, with an added coefficient of 2pi divided by the square root of the force of gravity, -9.8 m/s2. this mathematical model also shows that the mass of the pendulum and the angle of the swing has no impact on the period of the pendulum. 

once source of random error could be not accurately starting and stopping the stopwatch, or not consistently having the same person perform the same part of the experiment. this could lead to slight differences in the calculations that would affect the precision and accuracy of the graphs. these errors could be reduced by using the photogate to measure the time of the period instead of the stopwatch. also, consistently having the same person release the pendulum each time and having the same person measure the angle each time would help reduce the random error. systematic error may include having stop watches that have a delayed start or stop reaction time or using a protractor where the lines are not correctly marked. this can cause the accuracy of the results to be incorrect. these could be reduced by using newer, more accurate protractors and stopwatches, or the photogate.

one constraint in the experiment that could limit the generalizability of the results may include where the experiment is performed. the most precise results will occur in a vacuum where wind or air resistance are not factors. doing the experiment outside would result in wind and air resistance playing in to the forces on the pendulum and the results could not be as generalized as they are. the type of string might also be a factor in the results. a thicker string which would produce more friction might impact the period of the swing, which was not a factor that was tested in this experiment.
