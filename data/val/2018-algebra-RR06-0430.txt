conclusion:
	the purpose of this experiment was centered around whether changing the force due to the hanging mass impacts the acceleration of the cart. in order to directly answer this question, an experiment with multiple trials was performed. during the experiment, friction, gravity and the mass of the system were all held constant; whereas, the force due to the hanging mass was the independent variable and the acceleration of the cart was the dependent variable. the specific values of the controls can be viewed in table 1. from the experiment, a graph of velocity versus time was constructed for each trial using the software datastudio. the slope from each trial performed was used to determine the acceleration in each trial. therefore, a graph was plotted to find the relationship between the acceleration and force due to the hanging mass. the relationship, visually shown in graph 1, was a roughly linear relationship as indicated by an r-squared value of .9899, and shows as the force due to the hanging mass increases, so to does the acceleration. also, the error bars present within graph 1 were unable to be visualized because they were very small. this indicates a small range within which the true value can be found, which proves the relationship between the force and acceleration in this experiment was fairly accurate. while the graphical representation does provide a visual of this interaction, table 2. contains the raw data acquired from this experiment, which also shows the positive correlation between the independent and dependent variables. in conclusion, the acceleration of the cart and the force due to the hanging mass were directly proportional to each other in this experiment. while the experiment proved a direct relationship between the force due to the hanging mass and acceleration, using data from two other authors may support or hinder this relationship.

	data provided from two other groups may support or hinder the claim that a direct relationship between the force and acceleration was present. the first group, group 1, performed the same experiment to determine the relationship between the acceleration of the cart and the force due to the hanging mass. their hypothesis was that the acceleration of the cart would change when the applied force on the cart changed (group 1). this hypothesis was consistent with the hypothesis formulated in this experiment. the controlled variable in their experiment was the total mass of the system (group 1). also, the mathematical model, which can be found in table 3. and was derived from the slope of their acceleration versus force graph, was $y=0.0053 x - 0.02$ with an error of +-.001m/s2 (group 1). comparing this slope to the slope obtained in the experiment, which can be viewed in group 2’s data in table 3, the slope appears much smaller than what was obtained. however, this is due to the fact that the mass was measured in grams rather than kilograms. therefore, multiplying the slope by 1000 will provide a slope similar to the one produced in the experiment. this group also has a negative y-intercept, which indicates another force present within this experiment. this force may have been friction due to the mass of the cart being heavier at some point in the experiment, which would cause the cart to contact the track allowing friction to occur. overall, the data collected from their experiment was displayed in table 4 and was consistent with the data obtained, which showed a positive correlation between the acceleration of the cart and the force acting on the cart. from this observation, as the acceleration of the cart decreases, so to does the force acting on the cart, which was exactly what occurred in the experiment. the other group, group 3, also performed the same experiment and hypothesized the acceleration would be impacted by the applied force (group 3). their control in this experiment was also the mass of the system, which was 183.4g or .1834 kg (group 3). table 5. lists the data obtained from their experiment, and table 3. shows the mathematical model they obtained from their acceleration versus force graph, which was $y=4.3797 x$ with an error of +-.001m/s2 (group 3). the slope from this group’s graph was different than what was obtained from the experiment. after taking the reciprocal of this group’s total system mass, 1/.1834, the result was 5.453 kg, which was not consistent with this group’s slope (group 3). taking the reciprocal of the total system mass should create a value close to the slope of the line found in the acceleration versus force graph; however, the reciprocal was greater than their slope. therefore, there may have been a systematic error or another force present that was not accounted for that impacted their data. also, this group had a y-intercept of .002, which was fairly close to the theoretical model (group 3). nevertheless, the data from table 5 explicitly shows the same pattern as the previous two groups, which was the acceleration of the cart and the force due to the hanging mass were directly related to each other. therefore, the overall claim that the acceleration was impacted by a change in the applied force on the cart holds true for each group, which supports the hypothesis made by each group. the claim that the applied force impacts the acceleration was supported, but comparing the theoretical and mathematical models will provide a more definitive statement that the applied force and acceleration were related.

	comparing the mathematical and theoretical model can provide a better understanding of the relationship between the applied force and acceleration. from the slope intercept form of the line produced in the acceleration versus force graph, a mathematical model was produced, which was $y=5.1898 x - 0.0297$. for the most part, the mathematical model produced was fairly similar to the theoretical model, $f=m a$. the slope of the line within the mathematical model, 5.1898, was almost identical to taking the reciprocal of the mass of the system,1/.1824kg, which when calculated came out to be 5.4825. while the mathematical and theoretical models were similar, the difference appeared in the y-intercept of the mathematical model.  the y-intercept, -.0297, was negative; whereas, in the theoretical model the y-intercept was 0. this states with no force being applied, the acceleration of the cart was -.0297, which does not compare to the theoretical model. this may be the result of holding friction constant in the experiment. because the mass of the cart was larger in the first several trials, this may have caused friction to arise, which created a non-zero y-intercept in the mathematical model. therefore, neglecting friction allowed for an overestimation of the force due to the hanging mass and the acceleration of the cart as a result. ultimately, even though the y-intercept of the mathematical model was negative, the mathematical model does support the theoretical model. while neglecting friction caused the mathematical and theoretical models to differ slightly, modifying the theoretical model may allow for the mathematical model to be more related to the theoretical.

	modifying the theoretical model would allow for a better relationship between the mathematical and theoretical models. previously, the mathematical model slightly differed from the theoretical model because the mathematical model was formulated by excluding friction even though the force of friction was present in the experiment. however, when comparing the mathematical model, which in reality involves two forces present, with the theoretical model, that only accounts for one force, there was bound to be a minute disconnect between the two models. nevertheless, the mathematical model would better support the theoretical model after the theoretical was modified to include friction. therefore, allowing the sum of the forces acting on the cart to be equal to the product of mass and acceleration would compensate for the presence of friction within the experiment. ultimately, this would allow the mathematical model to better support the theoretical because both models would account for the force of friction. modifying the theoretical model allowed for a better connection with the mathematical model, but applying another factor in, the mass of the string, may also impact the acceleration of the cart. 

	using a heavy string to connect the hanging mass and cart would impact the acceleration of the cart. assuming the increase in the string’s mass was substantial, this would impact the force done by the hanging mass. because the cart and hanging mass would be connected by this string, the string would add mass to the hanging mass, which would cause an increase in acceleration. this hypothetical scenario provided a different perspective regarding the factors involved in this experiment, but there were other factors, random and systematic error that can also cause flaws in the data.

	throughout the duration of this experiment there were several potential errors that may have caused the data to be inaccurate. first, random error could have been present in calculating the mass of the bobbers. the degree of uncertainty of the balance was +-.05g. therefore, not knowing the mass of the bobbers to more decimal places may have impacted the force due to the hanging mass. therefore, taking several measurements of the same bobber and taking the average of those measurements may provide more accurate data in terms of the acceleration of the cart and the force applied. also, depending on how old the balance was, the scale may have been inaccurate in its measurements of the mass of the bobbers. this would introduce systematic error into the experiment with respect to the balance also. second, another random error could have occurred due to the datastudio’s calculation of the velocity versus time graph. because the acceleration was only calculated to three decimal places and the acceleration was calculated based on a line of best fit, this may have caused the data to be slightly less accurate. hence, performing several trials with the same hanging mass and taking the average of accelerations obtained may allow for more accurate data that can better support the hypothesis. last, systematic error was present in the form of friction. because friction was neglected in the experiment, this caused the acceleration and force applied values to be overestimated. the errors within this experiment may have impacted the data obtained, but there were several constraints that impacted the experiment as well. 

	constraints present within this experiment may have prevented more accurate data. one constraint would be the string connecting the hanging mass and cart, which may have impacted the data. while the track was long enough to displace the cart further, the string connecting the cart and hanging mass was not long enough to allow the cart to have a greater displacement; therefore, impacting the velocity of the cart as well as its acceleration. also, the distance from the original position of the bobbers to the ground could have impacted the data for a similar reason. the floor prevented the use of a longer string to connect the hanging mass and cart together in order to acquire a greater displacement. therefore, the floor and the string connecting the hanging mass and cart restricted the scale of this experiment. another constraint could be the fact that this experiment was not performed in a vacuum, which allowed for air resistance to impact the data. the presence of air resistance may have impacted the velocity of the hanging mass as the hanging mass fell, which would impact its acceleration and force as well. therefore, performing this experiment in a vacuum would prevent air resistance from impacting the data.
