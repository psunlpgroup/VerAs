discussion and conclusion

the research question being investigated in this lab is how the impact of applied force and mass on a system effects the acceleration of the system. through the investigation, it can be concluded that these is a relationship between applied force and the acceleration of a system. from all the data collected, it can be seen that as applied force is increased in a system, the acceleration of the system increases as well. we also tested how friction can impact the acceleration of the system and were able to determine that as friction increased, the acceleration of the system decreased. all the figures presented in the data section above show this trend of a positive correlation between the force applied and the acceleration of a system. the difference between the graph derived from my group and those of other groups can be seen in the r^2 and slope values of each graph. the slope values of the other groups appear to be smaller than the one found by my group and the r^2 values are all different values for each figure. the mathematical values can be seen on each of the figures above. my data does fit the mathematical model because the data collected was used to derive this model.
