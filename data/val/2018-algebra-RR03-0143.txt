discussion and conclusion:

	in our experiment, where we investigated the research question stated in tables 1-3, “what impacts the period of a pendulum swing” we concluded that out of the three things tested, mass, length of string, and angle, only the length of the string truly impacted the period of a pendulum swing.  we gathered this data by using a photogate to measure the exact time it took for a period to occur. the way that we determined what affected the period of a pendulum swing was by analyzing our graphs and tables. if you look at table 4 above, we ran an experiment of 10 trials, with all the same angle, length of string, and mass. we took this data and using excel gathered the standard deviation from it, with this standard of deviation, .019, we were able to interpret our error bars more clearly by plugging this in to the graph. it is also stated in our lab manual that the photogate has a scale error of .001 seconds, which we determined as a reasonable systematic error. this data helped us gather the graph you see in figure 3, which was made with the data in table 7. in this graph you can see the error bars, which indicate the uncertainty of the point. there is obviously overlapping, as even some of the dots overlap. the fact that the error bars overlap indicates that the difference is not statistically significant (p>0.05). the equivalency criterion is met in this graph, meaning all the points do not have enough difference to say that they affected the period of a pendulum.

	next, we investigated the affect of the angle that a pendulum was dropped had on the period of a pendulum swing. we used data from the graph in figure 2, and from the table in table 6 to discover if it had any affect on it. in our data we noticed that the period is steadily going up, depending on the angle. it went up very slightly, and this needed a graph to determine if it was statistically significant. in the graph the error bars are very noticeable, still using the same standard deviation of .019, and photogate error .001. the error bars in this graph overlap greatly, showing that this data is not statistically significant. the equivalency criterion for this is met, as the data points are so similar that they can be considered equal, since the margin of error would put each period taking around the same time. 

	lastly, we determined that the length of string does impact the period of a pendulum swing. we analyzed the graph above, figure 1, and its data in the table, table 5. we still used the same standard deviation .019, and systematic error of the photogate .001, to determine whether this graph was statistically significant. in the graph there are very small error bars, but still noticeable. you can see that none of these error bars overlap, displaying that this graph shows each point is statistically significant. the error bars not overlapping means that each of these data points have not met the equivalency criterion, meaning they are not equal, and are different enough to be considered significant. from the data in table 5, we can see as the length of the string got longer, the speed of a period decreased. this data also closely resembles the theoretical equation $t=2$ this would be represented by the slope of our line of best fit. which is a power function line as it had the best fit data with the highest r^2 value. we could test that our data is similar by plugging in a number, say .5 and checking the values we get for time of a period. doing this the theoretical value we obtain is 1.42, while our model value is 1.523. this shows that the data is similar in magnitude, and that are data is valid though with a margin of error. 

these errors could have varied widely across the experiment, systematic errors that were in the experiments were some such as the photogate having a .001 scale error. there were other systematic errors such as measuring tapes being off, the weight of a pendulum not being exactly 50, the scale we used to measure the mass being off, and the timers being milliseconds late. the random errors in the experiment included changing people to take time, having different response rates when recording time, and having a slightly different angle that we dropped the pendulum from when trying to keep it exact. this experiment also could have been more exact if we could have done more trials, varied the string length even greater, and varied the angle even greater that we dropped it from. being in the lab setting prevented all of these as we did not have the time, or space to do such things. these could easily affect data, as more trials could be compared and analyzed, and the data would turn up different, more space and variability in what we were testing could have showed greater, or lesser differences and negatively affects the results for future use.
