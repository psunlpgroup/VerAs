discussion and conclusion
 newton’s laws was to find out how the acceleration of the system changes when the force applied on the system changes. this experiment addresses the research question by allowing us to study the acceleration and force applied on the system by starting out with many bobbers connected to a small gold cart placed on an airtrack and then using the data studio to record acceleration. after each trial or data point, we would remove one bobber from the gold cart and place it on the other end of the string on the other side of the pulley and then run it again to get another acceleration data point. by doing this, we found that as the force applied on the system increased, so did the acceleration of the system. we could do it this way with a hanging mass because, we are measuring the acceleration and force of the whole system. our data showed a linear relationship between force applied and acceleration. you can see this by looking at figure 1. the experimental model obtained from doing this experiment was is  $y=5.23 x - 7.0$ with r2 being equal to 0.98. we wanted our r2 to be 1 because that shows that the data obtained shows the correct pattern and relationship. by the end of this lab we also figured out that our mathematical model was equal to is  $a=c1 f_y+c2$. our theoretical model was found to be equal to is  $a=\frac{f}{m}$ the experimental mathematical model supports the theoretical model because they both show how the whole setup is treated as a system and not as individual parts. during this lab we were able to change the acceleration of the system by moving the mass from one side (gold cart) of the system to the other side (hanging mass). this is why our theoretical model supports our experimental mathematical model. group 2’s data, as shown in figure 2, supports our data. their data showed that as the force applied on the system increased, so did the acceleration of the system. we found the same result when doing our lab. group 3’s data also supported our data. as the force applied on their system increased, so did the acceleration of their system. this was the same result that we reached at the end of our lab. you can see this by looking at figure 3 above. if a heavy string was used to connect the gold cart to the hanging mass instead of a very light string, it would not change the acceleration because the mass of the whole system is still one measurement, not separate things. an error that could have affected our results could be that the airtrack could still have some friction and because we didn’t test for it, we wouldn’t have any real way to know. another error that could have affected our results could be that our gold cart was not pulled far enough away from the device that was measuring acceleration, so maybe it did not get an accurate reading. one constraint of this experiment could be that you couldn’t really change the mass too much because we were only using bobbers, so maybe we didn’t have enough data points for different sized measurements to make big generalizations about the resulting patterns of this experiment.
