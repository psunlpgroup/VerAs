discussion/conclusion: 



overall, the purpose of this experiment was to find out what/which variable(s) impacted the time it takes a pendulum to complete a full period. looking at the experiment with mass as the independent variable, the range of uncertainty (standard deviation) is 0.0275075 (shows high precision) and the error bars are not overlapping (shows low correlation between variables). based off of this data and looking at the graph, it is supported that the spread is low over the data points, but they are not positively correlated. since the error bars do not overlap, the claim can be made that the uncertainty is higher for this variable. based off of this evidence, the claim can be made that our prediction was not correct for the impact of mass on a period. 

looking at the graph comparing the impact of angle release (iv) on the period (dv), we see that the error bars are not overlapping and that the standard deviation (uncertainty value) is 0.01619328. the error bars of this graph do not overlap, but standard deviation is low. knowing these results, we can compare this graph to the graph of mass impact on period. they both have low uncertainty measurements and high precision but they do not correlate to the period because their error bars do not overlap and they are not within one standard deviation of each other. it is concluded that our prediction on the impact of angle was incorrect. 

on the other hand, the experimental data and graph made from length vs. period shows a positive correlation indicating that length has an impact on period. supporting that claim, we can see that the error bars overlap and are consistent. this means that there is less uncertainty and it is all in a certain range. the standard deviation is higher for the impact of length on the period, but just by looking at the graph we can see that the correlation is positive. if we compare the mass vs. period graph with the length vs. period graph we can tell that the length vs. period graph has a positive correlation, the error bars for the independent variable, length, are shorter than those of mass and angle (they are all within one standard deviation of each other as well). a power curve fit and represented the data of length, showing us that there is a correlation. another indication that there is a correlation is the r^2 value of 0.995, which is close to 1, so this shows that this data is well correlated. it can be concluded that the only prediction that was correct, was the impact of length on a period. 

supporting the claim that length is the only independent variable that impacts the period is the theoretical model. below (picture 1) is a photo of the theoretical model. in order to support our claim even further, a mathematical model was created from our data of how length impacts period. our mathematical model was determined by graphing our data points in excel and deciding which line/curve fit our data the best. it was decided that the power curve is the best fit curve for the data points obtained. we then used excel to display the equation of our data on the graph and plugged data points into the equation to reinsure that the results were reasonable. supporting our claim even further is the theoretical model. the theoretical model should have a coefficient of 2.007 and an exponent of ½ . we can see that our mathematical model is parallel with the theoretical model by looking at the coefficient (1.9918) and the exponent (0.4962). both of these values obtained (coefficient and exponent) from our data in the mathematical model are very close to the theoretical equation. the reason that these values are not exactly the same could be because we rounded the time data by a decimal (random error). supporting our claim even more can be seen from our fellow classmates. everyone in our classroom’s data supported that length was the only iv that impacted the period (they all had r^2 values close to 1). 

although length impacting the period has been supported, there are some possible errors that were made during this experiment. during the first lab, one random error could be that we were not stopping the stop watch at the correct time (when the pendulum reached a full complete period). a systemic error that could have taken place would be if the stop watch was mechanically broken. we took note of these possible errors and improved it by using a photogate in the third lab instead of using a stop watch. another way to reduce random errors would be to take multiple trials of each measurement, and calculate the mean. one possible random error that could have taken place in this experiment could be our group rounding our time data by a decimal in the lab 03 results. this random error could have been reduced by not estimating measurements that we obtained. 

other than possible errors in our experiment, there could have also been some possible constraints. the first constraint is that the longest length of string that could be tested i lab was 200m due to the floor. another possible constraint that could have impacted our experiment would be the type of string that was used. what if different materials of string had a different effect on the period? the only string that was available to us was yarn. 

by looking at the data measured from our experiments and newton’s three laws, it can be concluded that our hypothesis of mass and angle impacting the period of a pendulum are refuted. contrary to this, we can see that our hypothesis stating that length of the string impacts the period of a pendulum is supported. applying newton’s laws and putting them together, it is supported that the independent variable length is the only variable that impacts the period. by applying these laws, we can see that we can break up the forces of the pendulum into vertical and horizontal forces. gravity and the vertical pendulum forces cancel each other out. mass, along with the force of gravity move up and down and the pendulum moves horizontally so these forces are canceled out. the vertical forces are canceled out because of equal forces acting on each other, but nothing can cancel out the horizontal movement. given this information and the measured data, it can be supported that the only independent variable that impacts the period is length of the string.
