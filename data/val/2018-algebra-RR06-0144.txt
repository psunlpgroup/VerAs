discussion and conclusion 



during this experiment, the research question asked was; how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? an experiment was set up using multiple different masses, to create multiple different forces, and to use those forces to compare their accelerations. as seen in the design template, the dependent variable in this experiment was acceleration. this was found by the independent variable, the applied force. the applied force was found by the mass of the hanging balls multiplied by the force of gravity. as seen in table 1, eight different applied forces were tested (0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, and 0.4 n) were to find their associated accelerations. as seen in table 2, each one of these applied forces had a measurement of uncertainty. as seen in figure 1, the applied forces and each of their uncertainty values were graphed with the associated acceleration values. the results concluded that the graph was linear, or that force and acceleration had a direct relationship (1 to 1). as seen in figures 2 and 3, the findings of other groups, this seemed to be a universal finding in this experiment. two other lab groups set up the same experiment (8 different applied forces vs associated accelerations) and both groups found that as their applied forces increased, the associated accelerations decreased giving a negative, but direct relationship between force and acceleration. this type of relation also producing linear results. the math model for this experiment is $a=c1 (f_{hanging})+c2$, c1 being 1/ (total mass of the system) and c2 being f(unknown)/ (total mass of the system. this model was used to find the applied force (hanging mass) of a system with an acceleration of 0.48 +/- 0.05.  this math model successfully found a hanging mass of 0.249 kg to have an acceleration of 0.483 m/s^2. however, there may have been some other factors besides the hanging weight that were present but unaccounted for. these forces are the gravitational force and friction force of the system. also, the non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart could have affected the acceleration of the cart, not by having some mass because that would remain consistent, but by adding an extra amount of friction due to knots or other imperfections of the string. some other errors that might have been present during this experiment were; the unaccounted-for forces in our mathematical equation and the measurements of our hanging weight could have been miss calculated. both of these missed measurements could have thrown off the final data of our experiment by some percent. using the mathematical model compared to the data resulted from experiment, our data was found to be accurate.
