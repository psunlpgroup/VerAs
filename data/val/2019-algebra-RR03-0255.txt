discussion and conclusion 

the research question we wanted to address in this experiment is what iv can we test in order to affect the period of a pendulum. 


for the first experiment we decided to test the mass of the pendulum for our first iv. we made sure to come with different mass numbers that we could easily change them throughout the experiment. we chose 50g, 130g, 170g, 230g, and 250g in order to conduct this experiment. we chose 2 controlled variables, which were the length of the string and the angle of the drop. for the length of the string we chose 20 in to remain constant throughout all of the tests, and we chose to drop each at 30 degrees. choosing these as our controlled variables made sure that we would have accurate and coherent test numbers. this addressed the research question because we believed that with these accurate tests, we would positively affect the period of the pendulum. 

for the second experiment we decided to test the length of the string for our second iv. we made sure to come with different length numbers that we could easily change them throughout the experiment. we chose 14in, 20in, 25 3/4in, 30in, and 34 1/4in in order to conduct this experiment. we chose 2 controlled variables, which were the mass of the pendulum and the angle of the drop. for the mass of the pendulum we chose 230g to remain constant throughout all of the tests, and we chose to drop each at 30 degrees. choosing these as our controlled variables made sure that we would have accurate and coherent test numbers. this addressed the research question because we believed that with these accurate tests, we would positively affect the period of the pendulum. 


for the third experiment we decided to test the angle of the drop as our third iv. we made sure to come with different angle numbers so that we could easily change them throughout the experiment. we chose 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 degrees in order to conduct this experiment. we chose 2 controlled variables, which were the length of the string and the mass of the pendulum. for the length of the string we chose 20 in to remain constant throughout all the tests, and we chose to keep the mass of the pendulum at 230g. choosing these as our controlled variables made sure that we would have accurate and coherent test numbers. this addressed the research question because we believed that with these accurate tests, we would positively affect the period of the pendulum. 

theoretical mathematical model is  when using the theoretical mathematical model, we had to use the equation $t=1.99 x^{0.5}$. in this equation t is equal to the time and x is equal to the independent variable length of string. when me and my group used this equation with our numbers, we created a graph that was close to resembling our graphs. what we can conclude from this is that our tests were accurate, but they could have been better. by using this equation, we can see how accurate our tests are. the one that differed the most was out test with the mass of the pendulum and angle of the drop. because of this equation we can see which tests we messed up on. if we wanted to we could go back and look over our mass tests and work through them better. our length of the string graph is the only one that accurately follows the equation, it is almost the exact same graph 

errors and constraints is  during the first lab, most of our errors came with timing. at first, we had one-person timing and another dropping the pendulum each time. this worked at first but as time went on our numbers started to be really spread apart and we realized that we needed to change up what we were doing. we changed up the timers for every test and that still didn’t seem to change our problems. finally, we decided to have the same person dropping and timing everything. this gave us more accurate numbers, so we knew that our test was going to be more accurate. 

once we started to use the online timer for the pendulum this completely changed the game. our numbers were more accurate than ever, and we had very accurate results. at this point we found very small room for error but there was one small error that was changing our numbers a little. the person dropping them pendulum sometimes would give the weight a little push in one direction and the weight would swing out of control. one time it was unable to stay within the monitor and it knocked it over. this happened less then 5 times but in order to make sure it wouldn’t happen for than that we would just redo a test that was screwed up due to this error made by the person dropping.
