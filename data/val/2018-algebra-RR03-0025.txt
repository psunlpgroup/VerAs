discussion and conclusion:



	the research question being investigated in this experiment is, “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?” during lab 02 is  measurement & uncertainty, we believed that mass, angle release, and length of string all affected the period of the pendulum. we believed this because, for the most part, our error bars did not overlap in all three of our graphs, figure 1, figure 2, and figure 3, causing us to believe that the data was affected by all three variables. the only error bars that overlapped were in the last two points of figure 2. we believed that this was because we used too large of an angle release. this data obtained in figures 1, 2, and 3 could have been due to error in our measurements and error in the measuring devices we were using. however, when using the photogate to measure our data in lab 03 is  creating mathematical models, we were able to obtain more accurate results with less systematic and random error. since our original results from lab 02 showed that all three variables influenced the period of the pendulum, all three factors were then tested again in lab 03 using the photogate. from the data obtained in lab 03, we concluded that the only variable that affects the period of the pendulum is the length of the string. starting with figure 4, there are large error bars that almost all overlap, showing that there was no real change in the period of the pendulum due to the mass of the weight on the pendulum. similarly, in figure 5, though the error bars are much smaller, two of them still overlap and there is very little distinct pattern in the data. a pattern begins to form when the angle is slightly larger. we concluded from our data that when the angle of the release is below 15°, there is no clear pattern in the data, therefore it does not affect the period of a pendulum for a small swing. the error bars that were present in figure 6 are so small that they cannot be seen and none of the error bars overlap. the relationship formed by the data points is non-linear, but there is a power relationship between the points. the slope intercept form of this line is $y=0.126445 x$ with an r² value of 0.9986, as shown in figure 6. from this information, we were able to conclude that the length of the string has a definite impact on the period of the pendulum, which coincides with our original hypothesis about the length of the string experiment (refer to templates 3 and 6). 

	the mathematical model that was obtained in lab was fairly similar to the theoretical model. the model we obtained from the line equation in figure 6 was c1 * l^c2. the theoretical model was $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. using the line equation from figure 6, c1 is equal to 0.3025 and c2 is equal to 0.4186. this shows the similarity to the theoretical equation because the value of 2pi/sqrt(g), 0.2007, is very close to the value obtained from the equation of the line of figure 6, 0.3025. also, the value of 0.4186 that we obtained from the line equation of figure 6 is very similar to the same value in the theoretical equation, 0.5. therefore, when the same value for length is substituted into each of these equations, a very similar result is obtained for the y-value. this shows that though the two equations are not the same, they are very similar. this is due to both random and systematic error encountered throughout the experiment. 

there were many examples of both random and systematic errors that could have possibly affected the results of our experiments. examples of systematic error occurred in the use of the measuring tools, such as the measuring tape, the protractor, the stopwatch, and the photogate, which had an error of 0.001. the uncertainty for the for the data in tables 1, 2, and 3 was calculated by using an excel spreadsheet to find the standard deviation of 10 swings with the same variables. the calculated standard deviation was 0.042479. this value was then used to create the error bars in figures 1, 2, and 3, which accounted for the uncertainty in the measurements. likewise, the value of 0.001 was used for the error bars in figures 4, 5, and 6. these systematic errors could have possibly shifted the data in one way or another. systematic errors could only be reduced by using more accurate measuring tools, not doing more trials of the experiment. examples of random error include the differing reaction times of each person timing the periods of the pendulum with the stopwatch. also, if the angle of the string was not held exactly at the correct mark, error in the data would have occurred. lastly, if the string was measured by different people each time, the way different people read the measuring tape could have affected the results. to reduce the impact of random error, more trials could have been run. also, graphing and analyzing the data and the error bars can reduce the impact of the error.

lastly, the constraints on the setup of this experiment could have also affected the results and data that was obtained. one constraint on this experiment is that it is nearly impossible to coordinate the exact time that the string is released and the exact time that the timer should be started or stopped. this was a constraint on the experiment and a major source of error. this could have caused the time of the period to be too large or too small. the use of the photogate helped to reduce this. also, the way that the angle was measured was a constraint on this experiment. this could have been reduced by taping the protractor instead of loosely holding the protractor at the top of the string. making these adjustments on the constraints of this experiment could possibly increase the accuracy of the measurements and the data, and therefore improve the precision and accuracy of the results and conclusions of this experiment.
