discussion and conclusion:

	the purpose of the newton’s laws experiment is to investigate how the acceleration of a system will change when the applied force is changed. the newton’s laws experiment was conducted in two parts in a two-week period. the first part of the lab focused on determining the mathematical model between the independent and dependent variable from the experimental data collected. the goal of the second part of the lab was to apply the previously determined mathematical model to solve a lab challenge. 

	during the first week of the experiment, the applied force of the system was altered by adding an additional bob to the end of the string at the beginning of each trial. as each bob was added, the acceleration of the car was measured. table 1 contains the values for the applied force and the recorded measurements of the acceleration for all eight trials. according to figure 1, the relationship between the applied force and acceleration is demonstrated by a linear mathematical model. the results found make sense because according to newton’s second law, $f=m a$ where f is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. therefore, when m is held constant, f is directly proportional to a. in the experiments performed, the mass of the system was constant, 0.189 kg. the model presented by figure 1 supports newton’s second law and shows that as applied force of the system increases, the acceleration of the system increases while the mass of the car system is held constant. 

	during the second week of the investigation, the findings of all groups from the first week were compared (see attached files – group 1 is blue; group 2 is red). both groups 1 and 2 discovered the mathematical model representing the relationship between applied force and acceleration to be linear ($y=m x + b$), where b is the force of friction. both groups identified similar sources of error and constraints, which included air resistance, unequal mass of bobs, and kinetic friction. hence, the data collected by the other groups supports our group’s claims that the acceleration is directly related to the applied force. additionally, the mathematical model discovered from the week 1 lab, $y = 0.0045 x + 0.0511$, was used to solve the challenge of calculating how much force needs need to be applied in order for the cart to accelerate at 0.5 m/s2. the variable x in the experimental model represents the applied force; x was found to be 0.152 n. two trials were run in front of the instructor to verify these findings.

 	after constructing a graph (figure 1) of the collected data from the first week, the experimental model was determined to be linear, indicated by the trend line being in the form of $y = m x +b$. the theoretical model, $f = m a$ was obtained from newton’s second law. in regards to the experiment that was conducted by the students, the mathematical model pertaining to our group’s experiment was $y = 0.0045 x + 0.0511$. in comparison to the theoretical model, the y in the experimental model represents the acceleration, the x is the applied force, and the 0.0045 is equal to 1/m. the y-intercept, 0.0511 represents the force of friction. the difference between the experimental and theoretical models is friction force is not in the theoretical model because friction is negligible. after comparing the two models, it can be concluded that the experimental model matches the theoretical model but is simply a rearrangement of it. if a non-massless string were to connect the hanging mass to the cart, the cart would still undergo uniform acceleration because the mass of the system would still remain constant but would include the mass of the string. 

	as in any other experiments, errors occurred. one source of systematic error was the bobs were of unequal masses. thus, it was difficult to determine the true value of the applied force. other examples of systematic error include the balance may not have been properly calibrated, and the track may not have been completely flat, which could have affected the acceleration of the cart. random error arose in the form of reaction time while measuring the acceleration of the cart. to reduce the errors, the students should conduct multiple trials for each applied force to ensure the accuracy of the acceleration values measured and use a properly calibrated balance to reduce the systematic error. constraints that may limit the generalizability of the results include time, environmental factors such as air resistance and kinetic friction, and any sources of random error that occurred such as reaction time while measuring the acceleration of the cart. due to the limited amount of time in lab, numerous trials could not be conducted. performing additional trials would provide more support to the hypothesis.
