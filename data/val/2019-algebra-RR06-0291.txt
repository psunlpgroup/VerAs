discussion and conclusion: 

	when conducting lab 05 and lab 06, the following research questions arose is  how does the acceleration of a system change when hanging mass changes?, how does the acceleration of a system change when total mass of the cart changes?, and how does the acceleration of a system change when friction changes? after investigating on the questions above and creating multiple hypotheses with independent, dependent, and control variables, we were able to come up with our own mathematical models. these models describe the behavior of the system. from there, we were able to understand the relationships between the values and variables we obtained. 

	the first experiment allowed us to determine the fact that hanging mass impacts the acceleration of the cart. in this case, mass is kept constant. acceleration was greater when the hanging mass applied was greater. the second experiment allowed us to determine that when hanging mass of the cart was kept constant, mass impacted acceleration. the total mass of the cart ended up increasing whereas the acceleration of the cart ended up decreasing. for lab 05, the data studio allowed for us to determine our mathematical model. that way, we were able to find the acceleration (the slope) for every trial completed. then, using excel we used accelerations (y-axis) and masses (x-axis) to create graphs. the equation was determined using the trendline. experiment 1’s equation came out to be a is 27.802 (hanging mass), whereas experiment 2’s equation came out to be $a = 0.524-0.77$ (total mass). the r2 value for experiment 1 was 0.9982 and for experiment 2 it was 0.9994. these numbers determine how well the data fits in the trendline. because our values are extremely close to 1, this tells us that our values fit the trendline as they should. by the time we completed lab 06, we were able to determine that friction contributes to the numerical values we found. we determined that friction and acceleration are inversely proportional. for lab 06, c1 represented the slope of the force. for this lab, our mathematical model came out to be $a = 2.9325 f – 0.0195$. this is a reasonable value for this experiment and the data made into tables and graphs. c2 is represented by -0.0195. c2 equals the sum of all forces divided by the total mass. 

	this is a picture of a group’s mathematical model from lab 06 that tested the same hypothesis as us. as seen in the picture, their r2 values are close to 0, which is very similar to ours. they are also within the 0.9 range. their values for slope are also very similar to the values we obtained from conducting this experiment. our values started with 1 and 2, whereas all of their values started with 1 (fairly close to ours). this resulted in our graphs to look similar. this allowed for our confidence to increase regarding the results we ended up with. 
	
	the mathematical model below is from a group that tested a different hypothesis than us. their r2 values are close to 0, similar to ours, however, their slopes are fairly small compared to ours. we can conclude that the slopes of their graphs will have less of an incline. so, their independent variable had a slightly smaller impact on their numerical data than ours. 


for both lab 05 and lab 06, more trials could have been conducted (if time allows) in order to increase the validity of our data and obtain a better representation for the data we found. another way to increase the validity of our data and the experiment, is be including more control variables. the reasoning for this is because if there are more variables actually being tested and kept the same, the chances of pinpointing where errors occurred increases significantly. this will allow for us to decrease the chances of having random errors in our data. also, a digital scale could have been used to weigh out the masses. a more accurate scale could allow for less systematic errors and better measurement numerical values. as always, we could be more cautious with conducting the experiment. this also would allow for less random errors to occur. as far as systematic errors go, making sure the lab equipment is working properly could allow for these types of errors to be completely avoided. 

one constraint that may limit our results is averaging our results. this increases the chances of having random errors connected with our data. the reasoning for this is because averaging numbers does not give us exact values. this makes our data too general the more averaging is used throughout the experiment. also, we only tested each experiment (both in lab 05 and the one from lab 06) a few times. for more accurate results, the experiments could have been conducted a few more times in order to get more data, and therefore increase the validity of our data. however, time did not allow for more trials to be completed. 

newtons second law states that $f = m a$. this means that acceleration from the net force is directly proportional to magnitude, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to mass. graphs 1.1 and 1.2 and tables 1.1 and 1.2 from lab 05 prove this relationship that when mass decreased, acceleration increased and vice versa. the tables and graphs from lab 06 (graphs 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 and table 2.1), show the directly proportional relationship with force and acceleration that newtons law states. therefore, our mathematical models are consistent with newton’s second law.
