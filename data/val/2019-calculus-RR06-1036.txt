discussions and conclusion 

a. the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model.

b. in lab 05, we tested how when the mass of the cart relative to the constant mass of the system is increased, the acceleration of the system decreases. this is modeled by $a=\frac{843.69}{m^{1.156}}$ where a is acceleration in m/s/s and m is the mass of the cart in grams. the mass raised to the negative exponent means that the greater then mass, the less the acceleration. we also tested how increasing the mass of the hanging weight relative to the system increases the acceleration. modeled by $a=0.027 m - 0.0116$ with a being acceleration in m/s/s and m being mass of the hanging weight in grams, we support our claim that in increase in mass causes an increase in acceleration, which is represented by the positive coefficient (.027) before m. 

c. group 1, who’s whiteboard is shown to the right, studied the affect that a forward tilt of the track had on the acceleration. in their equation,     $a=0.0026 f - 0.0094$ a is acceleration and f represents how much the track is tilted forward. this contributes to my understanding of what the numerical values in our mathematical models might represent because we now have proof that when gravity can act on the cart itself rather than just the weight, the acceleration increases. since no other group in our class tested the same variable as we did, we used the data our instructor collected when she tested

the same variable as we did. her data is found to the left, and it demonstrates that when a pair of magnets is moved down from the top of the cart to where it can act upon the movement of the cart, the acceleration decreases. the uppermost line is when there are not any magnets on the bottom, and then every line downward is the acceleration when a pair of magnets is added to the bottom of the cart. this confirms what we originally believed, but were unable to prove to be true; that the stronger the magnetic force through the track, the slower the acceleration becomes. 



d. due to our lack of success in lab 06, i can confidently state that there was plenty of error present in our trials. the random error includes but is not limited to; the magnets not being attracted to each other in the way we envisioned them, inconsistencies with the air track, and discrepancies in the aerodynamics of the cart. there could have also been some systematic error when we weighed a variety of masses early in the trials. we attempted to better secure the magnets by using more tape, but the setup was still not ideal. to improve this, we could just use increasingly larger magnets rather than try to tape magnets together, because magnets on the same side of the cart would repel each other and mess up their orientation. 

e. the biggest constraint in our experiment is that we only had two pairs of magnets to attach to the cart, which meant only three data points could be collected to attempt to prove causation. there is limited space on the side of the cart for additional magnets, but testing with more pairs could strengthen our support. 

f. in lab 05, when we added more mass to the cart relative to the system, the acceleration decreased. this is consistent with newton’s second law because in order to keep the force constant, the acceleration must decrease when mass is increases. also in lab 05, when we added more mass to the hanging weight attached to the cart, we were increasing the downward force of on the cart. therefore, the acceleration would either remain constant or increase with the mass. finally, in lab 06, as we increased the magnetic force opposing the acceleration, the acceleration decreased.
