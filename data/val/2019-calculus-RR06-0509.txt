discussion and conclusion:

the main objectives in the experiments that have been done during the last two weeks is to determine the relationship between the applied force and the acceleration, and to determine if the friction of the resting mass can impact the acceleration of the system. airtrack, bobbers, string, cart were the equipment that used to setup the experiment. the applied force was the weight of the bobbers that were hanged off edge of the table. in week 2 of the experiment, magnets were used to create friction between the cart and the track. the results show the acceleration of the system is affected by the applied force as well as the friction. 

in experiment 1, figure 1 shows the relationship between the applied force and the acceleration of the system. it shows that the acceleration increases when the applied force (when the number of bobbers increases), so it is positive relationship. for example, when the applied force was 0.0500n, the acceleration of the system was 0.123m/s^2. then when the applied forced increased to 0.0995n, the acceleration of the system so did to 0.254m/s^2. the mathematical model is $y=2.7048 x - 0.014$ y represents the acceleration of the system and x represents the applied force (the weight of the bobbers). the slop in the mathematic model represents 1/m, which is the revers of the mass of the system. and by the mathematic model the hypothesis of as the applied force increases, the acceleration of the system increases is proved. 

in week 2 of the experiment, the goal was to determine if the friction impact the acceleration of the system. the experiment was repeated 3 times. the first one was acceleration with no friction, it was done first to compare with acceleration with increased friction and acceleration with max friction. figure 2 shows that the relationship is positive. in the first trial the acceleration of the system was 1.070 m/s^2 when the applied force was 0.40376 n. while in the trial 2 the acceleration of the system was 0.254m/s^2 when the applied force was 0.0995n. the mathematical model is $y=2.6262 x + 0.007$. in the figure3, the graph shows the relationship between the applied force and acceleration with increased friction. in the first trail, the applied force was 0.40376 n and the acceleration of the system was 0.907 m/s^2. while in the trail 2, the applied force 0.35231n and the acceleration of the system was 0.791m/s^2. the mathematical model is $y=2.2588 x - 0.0048$. in the figure4, the graph shows the relationship between the applied force and the acceleration with max friction. i the first trail, the applied force was 0.40376n and the acceleration of the system was 0.770 m/s^2. while in the trail 2, the applied force was 0.35231n and the acceleration of the system was 0.672m/s^2. the mathematical model is $y=1.9328 x - 0.0102$. as it is clear in the results, the applied force kept constant. in order to figure out the relationship between friction and acceleration of the system. the friction force is directly proportional with acceleration, but they have opposite direction. as result, the results show that when the friction increased, the acceleration of the system decreased. 

picture 1 shows the data of another group that used the same hypothesis. our group compared our data to another group that did the same hypothesis and the numbers were not the same, but they decreased the first coefficient about the same. and the second coefficient decreased along with the other groups. using different magnets, cart, bobbers, and track from the other group could be one reason of making numbers different. this data increases the confidence of the group. picture 2 shows the data of another group that tested different hypothesis. the data of our group is very different from the group since they tested a different hypothesis. however, the numbers decreased as well as ours but at different rates. their second coefficient was a lot more affected by the changing of the height of the ramp rather than the friction and the first coefficient was not decreasing as much.
