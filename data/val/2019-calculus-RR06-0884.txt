Discussion and Conclusion: 
The purpose of this lab was to determine if mass and force influence the acceleration of the cart on a frictionless track and develop mathematical models which depict the behavior of a real system and to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value that was included in the model. 
The first experiment’s mathematical model was calculated by recording the data of the different trials in the experiment and then constructing a plot of that data. From there we added a line of best fit to the graph. The equation of the line of best fit is the mathematical model that represents the data. For the second and third experiment the mathematical model was constructed the same way, via recording data and then constructing a plot. The physical meaning of the y variable can best be described as the acceleration of the system while the x variable can best be described as the force that was applied to the system of the system for Experiment 5. For experiment 6, the y variable is best described as the mass of the cart and the x variable can be described as the force that was applied to the system. We can see that the x and y variables hold these values because looking at Figures 2 and 4, the x value is force and the y value is acceleration and mass respectively. The mathematical models are a direct representation of the data because the trendline on the graphed data is the equation of the mathematical model. 
The data for group one was very similar to ours. Their results helped us understand the numerical values to the data because they had their plots laid out the same way. They had their force and mass on the x axis with their acceleration on the y axis. This agreed with the claim that the x value is the mass and force while the y value is the acceleration. 


The other groups data that we analyzed was group 4’s data. They also had a very similar mathematical model that represented their data. They also had confirmed that their x values were force and mass respectively, also that their y value was the force. Overall, with the help of Group one and Group four’s data we understood why the x and y values had the numerical values they did. This is because when configuring a plot, you assign your independent variable to the x axis and the dependent variable to the y axis. In both experiments, the acceleration of the system is what we were trying to determine, making it our dependent variable. Therefore, we placed this onto the y axis. Similarly, we did this with the x values, force and mass. We knew that this went on the x axis because we controlled these variables. 


	One of the systematic errors in this lab was the lack of magnet strength. Because the magnets that were provided were not strong enough to slow down the magnets, a change in the data was not seen. Another systematic error that was in the experiment was the tape that was used to secure the magnets to the cart was not strong enough to secure the magnets close enough to the track to allow them to get ample friction between the cart and the track. 
	Some of the constraints in this lab that limited our results were the type of magnets that we were given to apply an outside force to the cart. The point of the magnets was to see how the cart’s acceleration would change when there was a friction applied. Because the magnets were not strong enough to slow the cart down, we did not see any change in data between the trials with or without the magnets applied to the cart. Another constraint in this lab is the limited mass that we could attach to the end of the pully system. This was a constraint in the lab because it only allowed us to get a certain maximum acceleration. With more mass, more trials could have been conducted which would allow us to get a better mathematical model. These constraints limited the generalizability of our results because we could have gotten a more accurate mathematical model that would represent our data. 
	The experimental mathematical models are consistent with Newton’s second law because they are demonstrating the true relationship between Force, Mass, and Acceleration. This is because as the force increases, the acceleration of the object will increase, assuming the mass of the system stays constant. We can also see how the mass of the car effects the system’s acceleration as well because if we assume that the force applied to the object is constant, then as mass increases, the acceleration will increase with it, same situation if the mass of the object is decreased then it will have a smaller acceleration.
