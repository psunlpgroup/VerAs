discussion:

the point of these labs was to isolate the variables of string length, bob mass, and starting angle to see if they have any relation to period length, and if so, to model said length.

the first experiment performed was to find if mass had a relation, and this test was completed by setting the starting angle at 90 degrees and string length at 20 cm, and then changing the mass to find points for a graph.  as shown in graph #1, there is no correlation.  the second experiment was designed to test the relation of the starting angle by setting the string length to 20 cm and the mass to 50 grams and changing the starting angle.  at first our data and graph #2 seemed to indicate a relation, but by comparison with other groups we found that the angle had no impact if the angle was less than 20 degrees (a range we had not tested).  the third experiment was to test the relation with string length, and this was accomplished by setting the starting angle to 90 degrees, mass to 50 grams, and changing the string length.  this showed a clear relation between both string and period lengths over all values as seen in graph #3.  the final experiment was to find more precise data point from experiment #3, and this clearly established that string length and period length were directly related in a power function as shown in graph #4.

the data presented in graph #1 shows no relation between mass and period length.  the data presented in graph #2 shows relation between starting angle and period length shows relation, but not enough data was found to build a model and there is no relation when the angle is less than 20 degrees.  the data presented in graph #3 show a clear relation between string length and period length for all values, but not enough data was found to build a model.  graph #4 presents a more precise version of graph #3 that gives the model
  where x is the string length in meters and y is the period length in seconds.  it has an r2 value of 0.998 which means that the data and the model fit nearly perfectly.

most errors occurred in experiments #1-3 and can be traced back to inconsistent reaction times with stop watches when trying to take period length.  therefore, these errors were nearly entirely reduced in experiment #4 with the use of a device to precisely take the period length.  it can be seen that this was the only significant error, as when if was removed, the data and model fit nearly perfectly.

the model found has fair generalizability, as although it can be used on any bob mass, it is still limited by the fact that it only applys when the starting angle is less than 20 degrees.
