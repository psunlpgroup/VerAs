discussion and conclusion:

the research question that was used during these labs was, “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force change?”.  looking at the data collected from lab 05 with its hanging mass support the research question. during the eight trails, we would add one more fishing bob to the string to create more applied force in the hanging mass. every time we add more to the applied force in the hanging mass, the acceleration also increases with it. you can look at the figure 1 in data and graph to see the acceleration increasing while the hanging mass also increase. when making the graph with the error bars, there are put into the graph but too small to see since there wasn’t a big uncertainty. when comparing data to other groups, we took photo of two other group boards to compare data. the photos are under the experimental design template. in group two board, the claim they made was “with the increase of force, the acceleration will increase as well”. when looking at group’s two data, their findings support the results and research question. with the hanging mass increasing, the acceleration also increases. other group we compare data to was group three and they showed the same results as ours and group two.  group’s three data and conclusion support the result of applied force and acceleration. once done with that, we the theoretical model ($a =\frac{f_{hanging}}{m} +\frac{f_{unknown}}{m}$) to compare our experimental equation ($y = c1 x + c2$) to see if it supports the theoretical model. our experimental equation supports the theoretical model because we able to get c1 is 4.465 and $\frac{f_{hang}}{m} = 5.363$. those two numbers are related because it was the acceleration and the uncertainty. then afterward a predication of the experiment was dealing with the string. the predication was if the string became heavy, how would the hanging mass and acceleration be affected. our predication was that even if did have a heavy mass, the system would remain the same mass and keeping the same acceleration. looking back, there could have been random errors like calculating the acceleration or systematic error like the setup of system and accidental did a small mistake. to reduce the errors would to check your work and check with the ta and make sure the setup is all correct. some constraints in the experiment would be the amount of trails to do, the length of the string, amount of fishing bobs to use, etc.
