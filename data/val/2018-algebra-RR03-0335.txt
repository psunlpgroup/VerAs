discussion and conclusion 

	from lab 01 we concluded that all three factors (length, weight, and angle) effected the period of the pendulum. the factors are directly proportional to the period of the pendulum. all results were consistent and shown on the graphs, and they show our predictions were accurate. there was error in this experiment because of human error, extra pressure of letting go of the pendulum, the angle was not accurate, the weight of the weights was the exact weight that it was supposed to be, and the tape measure could be old, and worn down, making it hard to read. 

	from lab 02 we concluded the error bars show that all three graphs have a direct correlation between the independent and dependent variables. as one increases so does the other, so the same relationship occurs. also, the graphs for length have a correlation whereas the graph for weight and angle have no correlation. the graphs for weight and angle have two times the standard deviation whereas for length there is one times the standard deviation. we are 95% confident for the length and time. 

	from lab 03 we concluded that the graph of the length vs. the period is a linear relationship where a straight line can be drawn through the plots but not through the error bars. there was an error in the photogate of 0.001 seconds. error bars this small depicts almost no uncertainty in the measurements. the graph of the relationship between length of the string and period of the pendulum is nonlinear. the power function that best fits the graph of the data depicted is $y=0.2039 x^{0.4948}$. using the theoretical mathematical model for the period of the pendulum, we could predict the period of the pendulum with length 0.50 m to be 1.42s.
