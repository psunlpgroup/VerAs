conclusion:
The research question is, “How does the applied force relate to the acceleration of a system?”
It can be seen from the data that the force from the hanging mass directly affected the acceleration. The graph shows that as the force increases, the acceleration increases in a linear proportion. It is known that the theoretical equation to relate force and acceleration is $F=m a$ We can see from the experiment that as more weight was added to the hanging mass the force applied increased which in turn affected the acceleration to increase. While each error bar overlaps by about half, when looking at all the data the points are spread out so that the error bars do not overlap with more than one other point showing that the data is reliable. The acceleration is accurate to about 0.5m-s^2. The applied force is accurate to about 0.8Newtons. 

The graph 1 shows the line equation to be $y = 0.4815 x - 0.147$ R² is 0.9891. The “No Clue” groups findings are is  $y=0.0489 x-0.0429$, and R2 is 0.9999. The R2 of our groups and theirs is close. However, the mathematical model is not. Graph one shows the slope to be 0.4815 while table 2 has the slope as 0.0489. In table 3 the findings are is  $y=4.9792 x-0.0085$ and the R2 is 0.9988. All three R2 values are close. This means that all three shows that the line fit is close to the data points. Thus, a linear relation is present between applied force and acceleration. Each slope is different however. Graph 1, table 2, and table 3show the slope to be 0.4815, 0.0489, and 4.9792 respectively. These discrepancies are due to error. Possible errors include is  imperfections of the air track, tilt of the air track, and friction between the string and pulley as well as the pulley and axle. 
The theoretical equation for applied force to acceleration is is  $f=m a$. The experimental mathematical model is $a= C1 w+C2$. The curve fitting of graph 1, table 2, and table3 are all with in an acceptable range and show that acceleration is equal to the force minus the friction. Where the b of $y=m x+b$ is the friction. It should be very low because of the air track, but air resistance and imperfections will still cause some friction. Acceleration is the y component and the force is the x component. The slope is constant since it is a line. This constant is the weight of the system not changing. For more than one force the theoretical model is $a=\frac{f1}{m1}+\frac{f2}{m2}$. Since the experimental model only had one force it cannot support this theoretical model. 
If a heavy string were used between the weight and the cart the acceleration would not be constant. This is because as the string passed over the pulley it would add to the applied force due to the effects of gravity. The mass of the hanging force would be increasing as time passes and the hanging mass gets lower. Thus, a heavy string would change the experiment and acceleration would not be constant since the hanging mass would be increasing. 
Random errors could occur in measuring the mass of the bobs and cart, when reading the weight. This could be reduced by taking several weights and averaging them. Systematic error could include is  imperfections of the air track, tilt of the air track, and friction of air resistance and of the string with the pulley and the pulley with the axle. 
Constraints of the experiment include the specific air track used. If a different air track were used it could affect the experiment differently. It would be important to use similar weights if the experiment were to be recreated.
