the overall point of this lab was to create mathematical models that would describe a specific property of an actual system. another purpose was to see how each variable and their associated numeric values could be included in an experimental model. the overall research question of this lab was to investigate the relationship between the acceleration of a system when the hanging mass changes, the mass of the cart changes, and the ramp tilt changes. the claim that was developed from experiment 1 was that an increase in the hanging mass causes the acceleration of the system to increase along with it.

the first experiment in which the hanging mass was the independent variable showed that the force was positively correlated to the acceleration of the system. the graph for this experiment depicts a positive, increasing slope between the applied force (n) and the acceleration (m/s^2). for this experiment, error bars were too small to be seen. an error of 0.001 m/s^2 was reported in the handout for the acceleration. 

group 2’s claim and data, as presented below support our claim from above. as stated by group 2, “the change in the hanging mass will increase the acceleration of the sliding block.” additionally, their data also supports this claim and for this reason would also support ours.
group 3 claimed that “as the mass changed, the applied force changes.” the graphs that the group were able to make demonstrate this relationship. as the hanging mass increased, the acceleration of the system increased as well since the slope of their graph was positive and increasing. therefore, group 3’s data also supports our claim mentioned above.
the theoretical equation for a single force is is  $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ . this equation supports the mathematical model, $a = c1 w+c2$. the independent and dependent variable relationship is present in the equation. the numerator of the equation represents the independent variable. the equation is   $a = c1 w+c2$ is very similar to the mathematical formula $y = m x +b$ which represents the dependent variable. since both the independent and the dependent variables are present in these equations, the experimental mathematical model supports the theoretical model. the enhanced theoretical equation is is  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ this enhanced equation supports the mathematical model, $a=c1 w+c2$, because the f / msystem  part of the equation is related to the c1 constant in the mathematical model.  similarly, the fexternal  / msystem part of the equation is related to the c2 constant in the mathematical model. 

if a heavy string was connected to the hanging weight of the cart, the force exerted would most likely be so small that it would not affect the result to a noticeable degree. the relationship between the hanging mass and the acceleration would most likely stay the same, perhaps marginally increasing, but to almost no noticeable difference. a major constraint for this lab was that the for the first experiment, the track was level. no variation in tilt was measured in the first experiment. furthermore, the string that connected the cart and the balls was assumed to be massless in for the first experiment. lastly, the pump was set to the highest rotations per minute so that the amount of air coming out of the pump would increase, thus reducing the amount of friction. 

as mentioned above, the pump was set to the maximum rotations per minute to ensure that friction was reduced as much as possible. if the pump was not set to the highest setting, this could have been a systematic error that was present when the experiment was conducted. regarding a random error, it is possible that the track was not level with the surface before starting the experiment. to prevent this random error, a leveler could be used to ensure that the track was perfectly level with the surface.
