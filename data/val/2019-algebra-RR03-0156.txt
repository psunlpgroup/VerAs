discussion and conclusion

the research question being investigated in this lab is “what effects the period of a pendulum?”

experiments one and two helped address the research question by using mass as the independent variable. when referring to graph 1 and data table one there appears to be a negative correlation between the iv, mass, and the dv, pendulum period. however after appropriate error bars were added in experiment 2 it can be seen that the error bars for each point overlaps, meaning it is not significant. therefore the claim can be made that mass does not affect the period of a pendulum and this claim holds true with control variables of 50-cm string length and a 20 degree angle of release.

experiments one and two also helped address the research question by using the angle of release as the independent variable. when looking at graph 2 and data table 2, there again appears to be a negative correlation between the iv, angle of release, and the dv, pendulum period, but after the ranges of uncertainty were added to the data points the error bars clearly overlap so the claim can be made that angle of release does not affect the period of a pendulum. this claim holds true under the control variables of a 50-cm string and a mass of 149.71 g on the pendulum. 

experiments 1, 2, and 3 addressed the research question by using the length of the string as the independent variable. based on graph 3 and data table 3, there appears to be a positive correlation between the iv, string length, and the dv, pendulum period. there error bars included from experiment 2, with a range of uncertainty of 0.105, overlapped meaning the data was not significant. however when looking at graph 4 and data table 4, the same experiment was ran but with more precise equipment, the photogate. the range of uncertainty was 0.001 and was so small that the error bars could not be seen on the graph. from this the claim can be made that the string length affects the period of a pendulum and that there is a positive correlation between the independent and dependent variables. this claim holds true with the control variables of a mass of 149.71 g and an angle of release of 20 degrees. 



the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. as seen in graph 4, the mathematical model that best fit the data for the string length versus the pendulum period was the polynomial model. the equation was $t=-0.0001 l^2+ 0.0242 l+0.6456$ and the r^2 value was .99826, which is very close to one indicating the data fits the model well. for the independent variable of mass, when referring to graph 1, the polynomial mathematical model was also the best fit with an r^2 value of .84417. for graph 2, which represents the effect of angle of release on the period pendulum, the data also fit the polynomial model best. the r^2 value was .92087. 

the possible random errors could be lack of precision in the scales or stopwatch used. random error can be reduced by increasing the sample size and collecting more data. systematic error is harder to detect and an example would be if the scale was off by a specific value each time, resulting in skewed results either too high or too low. the best way to reduce systematic error in the future is to maybe compare values obtained from different trials where other equipment was used.

a constraint of this pendulum lab is that not very many trails were ran and the length of the string was only tested between 10 and 50 cm so the generalizability of the results is limited to those conditions with the control variables previously listed. another constraint that may limit the generalizability of the results is if there was any type of air resistance present during the pendulum period.
