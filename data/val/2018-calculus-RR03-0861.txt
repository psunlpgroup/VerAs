Discussion & Conclusion:
	In this lab, we were asked to determine which of three factors (mass, drop angle, and string length) influence the period of a pendulum. After experimenting with each of these independent variables in three different tests, we can make reasonable claims about their respective impacts on period.
	Prior to the experiment we predicted that mass would not influence the period of a pendulum, and we now have reasonable evidence to support this claim. In multiple trials with differing masses, there was almost no variation in our recorded period (as shown by the data in Table 2 and Figure 1); this also means that our error bars overlap exactly with one another. Since we are 95% confident that the true period falls within each error bar, it is certainly reasonable to claim that period does not change with respect to mass.
	Our prediction that drop angle has no impact on a pendulum’s period appears to hold true, based on our data. Table 4 does show slight variation among our data points, ranging from 1.89 to 1.90 seconds. However, the error bars in Figure 2 allow us to justify these fluctuations; these points only vary by 0.01 seconds, which is less than the uncertainty value of 0.0108. That means the error bars of the data points overlap significantly, allowing us to rationalize that a straight horizontal line can be drawn to describe the trend. Resulting from this is the notion that period does not necessarily change as the drop angle changes.
	In Labs 01 and 02, we confirmed our initial claim that string length does impact a pendulum’s period. Then, Lab 03 asked us to reaffirm our data using a photogate. As shown in Figure 3, there is an obvious positive trend that cannot be described by a horizontal line; by considering the miniscule size of the error bars (+/- 0.002 seconds), we see no overlap in the data range and can therefore conclude that period is affected in some way by string length. Our next step was to calculate a trendline for the length vs. period graph in Figure 2. Microsoft Excel computed a R2 of 0.9988 for the trendline that utilized a power curve. Since this value is so close to 1, we have reasonable confidence in our equation.
	As provided by our instructor, the theoretical equation for period is  . The computed equation for our data looks slightly different, as pi and the acceleration due to gravity were not measurable during this experiment. Our mathematical model is $y=0.12263488 x$. We know this is precise in relation to our data because of the large R2 value associated with it. From there, we can compare its results for a few given points to see how they stack up against the theoretical outputs is 

According to Table 7, our mathematical model consistently overestimates the theoretical value by approximately 0.1 seconds. Since the two computed periods are close in value and vary by about the same amount each time, we can reasonably state that our mathematical model is supported by the theoretical model. The 0.1 second difference will be addressed in the errors section below.
	Random errors are essentially inevitable in a lab environment, so it is important to consider these in post-lab discussion. There were three manual measurements in this lab that were likely the source of any random errors that may have occurred is 
       String length measurements could have been misread or measured incorrectly.
       Slight variations in point of view may have caused changes in the drop angle.
       Human reaction time is not always constant, so times may vary slightly from trial to trial.
There is also one very prominent systematic error, which we believe to be the source of the discrepancy described in Table 7. When measuring each string length, we terminated our measurement at the end of the string rather than including the added length of mass. It was later brought to our attention that this tactic did not account for the entire length of the pendulum. Had we measured completely from top to bottom, our length would be more correct for each string, and the resulting period would be much more comparable to that of the theoretical model.
