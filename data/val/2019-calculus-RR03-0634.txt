discussion and conclusion:

the research question being investigated in this lab is what factors influence the period of the swing of a pendulum, for small swings.

the first experiment addressed the research question by determining if our hypothesis was true, in that only the length of the string had an affect on the period of the swing. we did this through testing first with length as the independent, then mass, then angle of release. after preforming this experiment, we were able to conclude that the length was the only one of the variables that had a true effect on the results of period. we were also able to create graphs with our data that allowed us to see a trend in the length testing, but not in the other two tests. the second experiment addressed the same research question but brought error into the equation. in this experiment, we discussed possible errors that could have occurred, and how we could prevent them in the future. we also retested the testing from the first experiment somewhat, and through using this error analysis and testing, we were able to come to the same conclusion as in the first experiment. once again, the graphs we made supported our hypothesis by showing a true correlation or trend in only the length based one. the third experiment addressed the research question by creating a mathematical model to test out the hypothesis and confirm our data. we also were able to find the same result in this experiment as the previous ones and used the mathematical models to confirm our prediction. the graph for the third experiment was fairly similar to the previous experiments, in that it showed the relationship between the length of the string and the swing of the pendulum. we added error bars to it following the second experiment, and for the third experiment, we were able to fit a polynomial trendline to the data and receive an r value of 0.999 which shows the trendline to be extremely accurate for the data. the claim that was made throughout all 3 experiments was that the length of the string had a direct effect on the length of the period of the swing. this claim is valid when the mass of the weight and the angle of release stay the same through each test. we did find however, that if you increase the angle of release to an unreasonable amount, such as 75 degrees or higher, the data began to become unreliable, as the swing was not moving in the same path, and there was more error involved.

the theoretical mathematical model for the pendulum is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$. our data fits this model because we were able to obtain very close times in our actual testing, to those times found using the theoretical equation. this is also shown in the graphs throughout all 3 experiments, and especially in the third experiments graph. the polynomial trendline that we found has its own equation, and the results are very similar to the results that we get from the theoretical equation. because the mass and angle of release did not affect the period of the swing to a noticeable degree throughout any of the three experiments, they are not included in the theoretical equation, or in the one that we got from our trendline. if they influenced the period of the swing, they would have been included in the graph, and therefore in the equation.

the random errors that were present in our testing could have been extra force put on the weight on release, incorrect measuring of the string length, or weighing the weight for the pendulum incorrectly. these random errors could have been present and would have possibly affected our results. the way that we could prevent these random errors from occurring in the future would be to make sure to not push when releasing, measure the length of the string several times, and measuring the weight several times. when it comes to systematic errors, i do not believe that any were present. some possible systematic errors could be incorrectly marked measuring tapes or imbalanced scales; however, i believe that our equipment was up to par. 

the only true constraint in this project that could limit our generalizability would be the limited tests that we did. we only have a certain time to do this testing, but if we were able to do hundreds or thousands of tests, we would get data that would nearly perfectly fit the trend line we are expecting. this is because the more tests you do, the less that random errors matter, because outliers will be eliminated.
