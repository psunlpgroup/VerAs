discussion and conclusion

	the research question being investigated in this lab is whether the mass of the pendulum, the length of the pendulum, or the angle of release influences the period of the pendulum.

	each of the three experiments used one independent variable with two control variables to see the effect is has on the dependent variable, which is the period of the pendulum. the angle was tested by only adjusting the angle of the release to see how it affected the period. when the mass was tested, only the mass was adjusted to see its effect on the period. lastly, the length of the string was tested by only adjusting the length and seeing how it affected the period. after the three experiments were done, it can be concluded that the length of the string effects the period of the pendulum. this claim can be made under the circumstances that two variables are controlled. when testing the length of the string, the mass and angle of the pendulum was constant in order to verify that the length of the string is what affects the period of the pendulum.

	we used the mathematical model to compare our results. the theoretical coefficient is 1.99, and from our results, our coefficient was calculated to be 2.0395. for our power of x, we calculated the value to be .518, which is very close to the theoretical value of .5. the values we calculated are very close to the theoretical value meaning that our data was precise. 

	our data being off from the theoretical value was due to errors in the experiment. some random errors that were included in our experiment include improper use of the stopwatch, the angle of release not being accurate, and the improper measurement of the string length. our experiment also included some systematic error including tape measure error, our balance being improperly balanced, and the improper measurement of the period of the pendulum. one thing done to eliminate the stopwatch error was using the photogate to measure the period. other ways to prevent some of these errors could include a better way of measuring the angle in a more accurate way and a more accurate way of measuring the length of string for the pendulum. 

	some constraints in this experiment include the size of the experiment. one thing that we could test was for bigger masses. we were limited to the amount of mass that we could attach to the string. another constraint that we had was the length of the string. we were limited on the amount of space that we could use for the experiment. the size of the room limited us on being able to test the variables on a large scale. with more room to test, we could then test larger values for the variables listed.
