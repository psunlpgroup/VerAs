discussion and conclusion



these experiments were performed to answer the research question, “what impacts the period of a pendulum?”. in these experiments, the relationship between the length of the pendulum and the period, the mass of the pendulum and the period, and the drop angle of the pendulum and the period were all tested.  these three variables were easy to test in an accurate way, which will allow us to determine whether these variables impact the period of a pendulum or not, so it was crucial that these three variables were tested. these experiments produced convincing results based on the data recorded.



the data collected in the period versus string length experiment performed in laboratory 1 and the period versus pendulum length experiment carried out in laboratory 3 support this claim is  as the string/pendulum length increases, the length of the period increases as well. these experiments tested the effect of the string/pendulum length on the period in order to determine whether the string/pendulum length affects the period or not, which directly addresses the research question mentioned above. the claim is supported by the results, and the results are explained by the fact that the distance traveled by the pendulum must increase as the string/pendulum length increases. in the trials for the length of the string/pendulum, the control variables were the angle of drop (60° from the vertical) and the hook mass on the end of the pendulum (50 g). through this experiment, it was determined that the relationship between the period of oscillation and the length of the pendulum is that of a positive power series. the graph of the period vs string length (figure 1) and the period versus the pendulum length (figure 3) clearly displays the strong relationship that the string and pendulum length have with the period. even after accounting for the error bars showcased in the graph, the relationship between the period and the string/pendulum length is solid. moreover, in the graph of the period versus the pendulum length (figure 3), the error bars are negligible, as they are not visible. therefore, the confidence in the claim derived from this data is extremely high.



the data collected in the period versus mass of the pendulum experiment performed in laboratory 1 support this claim is  as the mass of the pendulum increases, the length of the period remains unchanged. these experiments tested the effect of the string/pendulum length on the period in order to determine whether the string/pendulum length affects the period or not, which directly addresses the research question identified above. the claim is supported by the results, and the results are explained by the fact that the weight (the force of gravity) increases along with the mass, so the period is unaffected. in the trials for the mass, the control variables were the angle of drop (60° from the vertical) and the length of the string (30 cm). through this experiment, it was determined that there is no relationship between the period of oscillation and the mass of the pendulum. the graph of the period vs mass of the pendulum (figure 5) clearly displays the nonexistent relationship that the mass of the pendulum has with the period, as the graph is essentially a horizontal line. after accounting for the error bars showcased in the graph, it becomes clear that there is, assuredly, no relationship between the period and the mass of the pendulum. therefore, the confidence in the claim derived from the data collected during this experiment is particularly high.



the data collected in the period versus drop angle experiment performed in laboratory 1 support this claim is  as the drop angle increases, the length of the period is unaffected. these experiments tested the effect of the drop angle on the period in order to determine whether the drop angle affects the period or not, which directly addresses the research question stated above. the drop angle does not impact the period of the pendulum, although the distance traveled per period is farther, because the pendulum’s maximum velocity increases (as a result of the force of gravity) as the angle approaches 180° from the vertical (an upside-down position). in the trials for the drop angle of the pendulum, the control variables were the length of the string (30 cm) and the hook mass on the end of the pendulum (50 g). through this experiment, it was determined that there is no relationship between the period of oscillation and the drop angle of the pendulum. without accounting for the error bars shown on the graph of the period vs drop angle (figure 7), the relationship between the period and the drop angle appears to be that of a positive power series. after accounting for the error bars present in the graph, the relationship between the period and the drop angle becomes negligible, meaning that there is no convincing relationship between the period and the mass of the pendulum. ergo, the confidence in the claim data derived from the data recorded in this experiment is high.



since it has been determined that the only factor that definitively impacts the period of the pendulum is the length of the string/pendulum, the mathematical model produced from these measurements is the equation for the power series that fits the graph of the period versus the length of the string/pendulum, which is $t=1.02870196 l$ where t is the period and l is the length of the pendulum (nave). as this model was directly produced from the measurements taken in this experiment, which have a high degree of confidence, the confidence of the model is also high. moreover, the r2 value for the mathematical model derived from our measurements is 0.9999, meaning that it is particularly precise. it can be shown that the mathematical model generated from the data collected in this experiment is exceedingly close to the theoretical model,       $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$          where t is the period, l is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. near the surface of the earth, where these experiments were performed, the acceleration due to gravity can be approximated as 9.80 m/s2. to simplify the theoretical model into a form that fits our mathematical model, the value of 2πg-0.5 can be evaluated, resulting in one coefficient in front of l0.5. doing this, the theoretical model is approximated as $t=1.0035 l$. to quantify the error between the mathematical model and the theoretical model, the percent error formula will be used. the percent error for the coefficient of l is 1.176%, and the percent error for the power of l is 1.32%. both errors are quite small, exhibiting that the differences between the mathematical model produced from the data and the theoretical model are minimal. therefore, it is claimed that the mathematical model produced from experimentation strongly supports the theoretical model.



although the results were relatively accurate and precise, there existed sources of random error that were present in all experiments. in laboratory 1 only, one source of random error was human reaction time to a visual stimulus, which likely impacted the measured times and calculated periods of oscillation. another source of random error was that the hand of the person who was dropping the pendulum could move, causing the drop angle to be smaller or larger than the desired angle. moreover, a source of random error that was present in both laboratory 1 and laboratory 3 was that the metal frame holding the pendulum occasionally shifted upwards and downwards while the pendulum was swinging. finally, the pendulum tended to oscillate sideways, which skewed the data collected for the trials where this happened. in laboratory 3, the random error of human reaction time was removed using the photogate to measure the period of oscillation of the pendulum. the source of random error resulting from a person dropping the pendulum could be completely removed by utilizing a mechanism that would hold the pendulum at a certain angle and release it when desired. using a mechanism such as this would also completely remove the random error caused by the pendulum’s sideways oscillation. to reduce or remove the error caused by the metal frame swinging, a sturdier frame could be used to hold the pendulum. in these experiments, there also existed small amounts of systematic error. in laboratory 1 only, the stopwatches that were used only displayed times to the nearest hundredth of a second, introducing an uncertainty of two hundredths of a second. additionally, there existed a minor amount of uncertainty in the length measurements, as a standard tape measure was used for length measurements in laboratory 1 and laboratory 3. the tape measure induced an uncertainty of 2 mm in the pendulum and string length measurements. the protractor only measured angles to the nearest half of a degree, which produced an uncertainty of 1° in the measurements of the drop angle. regarding the data collected in laboratory 3, the photogate had a scale error of 0.001 seconds. moreover, air resistance and friction caused each oscillation to have a shorter amplitude, impacting the recorded times and calculated periods.



the mathematical model calculated and verified above is only valid within certain constraints that were present in all experiments (nave). one constraint to this mathematical model and the results of this experiment is that it is only valid for small angles (nave). another constraint for this mathematical model is that pendulum’s rod must be of negligible mass (nave). for the experiments performed, the pendulum’s rod was the string, which is of negligible mass. considering these constraints, the results obtained in this experiment cannot be generalized to pendulum motions with large amplitudes or to pendulums where the mass of the rod is not negligible.
