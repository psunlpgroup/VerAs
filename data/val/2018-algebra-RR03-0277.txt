discussion and conclusion

the research question of this lab report is what impacts the period of the pendulum for small swings. first, the affect of the angle of release on the period of the pendulum was explored. after multiple trials with different angles of release, the hypothesis was incorrect and there was an insignificant to no relationship between the angle of release and the period of the pendulum.  the r2 value was only 0.78 and the slope of the graph of angle of release vs. period of the pendulum was merely only 0.0015 and error bars were kept relatively small. this concludes that there was a very small to no relationship between the angle of release and the period of the pendulum. 

next, the affect of the mass of the pendulum on the period of the pendulum was explored. after multiple trials with different masses, the hypothesis was incorrect and there was no relationship between the mass of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum.  the r2 value was 0.007 and the slope of the graph of mass of the pendulum vs. period of the pendulum was merely only 2e-5 and error bars are kept relatively small. this concludes that there was no relationship between the mass of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum.

finally, the affect of the length of the pendulum on the period of the pendulum was explored. after multiple trials with different lengths, there was a relationship between the length of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum. the relationship is demonstrated as a powered equation and is shown as $y=0.135377 x$ and was supported by a strong r2 value of 0.99 and there is very little space in the error bars. since a relationship was discovered, more accurate instruments were used with more trials to have a smaller uncertainty. this information concludes that there was a relationship between the length of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum.

there were many sources of error that resulted in random or systematic error. one major example that was found in all the experiments except mesuring the length of the pendulum vs. the period of the pendulum was the source of time that was done by human reaction. other sources of human error included, the measurement of the angle being done by the human eye, delayed response of releasing the pendulum. these are all a result of random error. other types of error that could be possible is error in the calibration of the stopwatch, laser timer, or scale which would result in systematic error. these errors can be eliminated by having more accurate technology and limiting the amount of human interference in the lab experiments. in addition, working in a closed environment with no interference from the atmosphere and calibrating all the equipment would also limit any errors. finally, having more trials would make the experiment more accurate as well. some constraints that were involved in the lab include the limitation of the length of the pendulum, mass of the pendulum, and angle of release. the length of the pendulum could not pass 200cm for sufficient operation of the experiment along with the mass having a maximum of 300g and limiting the angle to not past 40 degrees. having limitations could rule out possible different outcomes of the period of the pendulum that can significantly affect the experiment.
