discussion and conclusion

	during lab 05, the effect of the applied force on the acceleration of a system was investigated.  the independent variable of applied force measured in newtons was tested against the dependent variable of acceleration measured in m/s2.  the control variables of this experiment were the mass of the system (187.7g) and the length of the string (111.3cm).

according to the data displayed in table 1 and graph 1, there is a clear positive relationship between the applied force on the system and the acceleration of the system.  the error bars do not overlap (in fact they are so small they cannot be seen on the graph) so the data can be accepted.  the data from this investigation supports the hypothesis that the applied force on a system affects the acceleration of the system, as well as the prediction of a linear relationship between applied force and acceleration.  the resulting linear equation from graph 1 was $y=0.0042 x - 0.0221$ where the coefficient of 0.0042 represents 1 divided by the mass of the system (187.7g), and the y-intercept of -0.0221 represents unknown forces, such as friction, divided by the mass of the system.

	figure 1 shows the design template and results of team squrt.  this team presented the same hypothesis and variables seen in this report.  their resulting mathematical model of          $y=4.346 x - 0.169$ initially appears significantly different from our own, however this is actually due to their calculation for the coefficient of x being done in kilograms rather than grams.  when done in grams, their coefficient of x becomes about 0.0043, making our value of 0.0042 within the range of uncertainty of 0.001, therefore this group’s findings support our own.

	figure 2 shows the design template and results of the group “monkeys”.  this group presented the same hypothesis and variables seen in this report as well.  their resulting mathematical model of $y=0.0043 x + 0.055$ is very close to our own (well within the range of uncertainty) and therefore also supports our findings.

	the theoretical mathematical model for acceleration of the system in this experiment is $a =\frac{f_h}{m} +\frac{f_u}{m}$, where “fh” refers to the applied force caused by the hanging mass, “fu” refers to unknown forces such as friction, tilt of the air track, and/or air resistance (negligible), and “m” refers to the mass of the system.  these unknown forces can be seen in the negative y-intercept.  because acceleration is a vector quantity and friction was applying a force in the opposite direction of the cart’s movement, a negative y-intercept was calculated.  according to this model, the theoretical coefficient of x from graph 1 should be (1/187.8) so 0.005.  this coefficient falls within the range of uncertainty (+/- 0.001); therefore our experimental model is within 1 standard deviation of the theoretical model.  in this experiment, if the string used had not been massless, its weight would be distributed over a larger area rather than the mass being localized at the cart and the hanging mass.  this would have resulted in a slower, non-uniform acceleration of the cart.

	while the resulting mathematical model was fairly accurate, the inaccuracies that were found can be attributed to constraints in the lab as well as possible errors.  within the confines of this lab, we are unable to measure the forces of friction present between the cart and the track as well as between the string and the rotary motor sensor.  because of this, our results are somewhat lacking in generalizability due to the fact that friction is present in almost all systems and we were unable to measure the effect of these sources of friction.

	some possible errors from this lab include inconsistencies in the release distance of the cart, tilt of the air track, accuracy errors within the rotary motor sensor, and a large hole in the tubing through which air flowed into the air track.  if the cart was not release the same distance from the rotary motor sensor, the extra length of string on the hanging mass (or lack thereof) could result in a change in the applied force, resulting in random error.  this could be reduced by determining a precise location from which the cart would be released, rather than judging by the length of the hanging string.  if the air track on which the cart moved were tilted at all, the cart would freely move either forward or backward without a hanging mass being attached due to gravity, resulting in systematic error.  this error could be reduced by leveling the air track, or by finding its resting angle and using that to solve for the x-component of acceleration due to gravity and removing that acceleration from what was measured in each trial.  if the rotary motor sensor was inaccurate, this would result in systematic error showing accelerations that are either less than or greater than the actual acceleration of the system.  this could be reduced by calibrating the system.  lastly, the large hole in the tubing through which air flowed into the air track resulted in a large amount of escaped air, reducing the air pressure in the system and therefore increasing the frictional force of the cart on the track, resulting in systematic error.  this could be eliminated by repairing the tubing.

	in this experiment, the effects of a change in applied force on the acceleration of a system were investigated.  it was found that there was a direct, positive relationship between applied force and acceleration is  as applied force increased, the acceleration of the system increased linearly, resulting in a mathematical model of $y = 0.0042 x – 0.0221$.
