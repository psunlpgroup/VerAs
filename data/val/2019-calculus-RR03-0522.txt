conclusion:
the research question being investigated is “what impacts the period of a pendulum?”

          the experiment with the angle of release as the independent variable addressed the research question by keeping the other variables constant while the angle was changed each trial to try to determine if the angle of release had any affect on how long it took the pendulum to complete one period.  after the experiment, our group determined that the angle of release didn’t have an impact on the period of the pendulum.  the trendline of the data only has a slope of .013, which gives the impression that the time doesn’t increase with the angle.  additionally, the error bars on the graph overlap so it can’t be concluded that there is any relationship between the angle of release and period of the pendulum.

          the experiment with the length of the rope as the independent variable addressed the research question by keeping the other variables constant while the length was changed each trial to attempt to determine if the length of the rope had any affect on how long it took the pendulum to complete one cycle.  after the experiment, our group determined that the length of the rope did have an impact on the period of the pendulum.  initially with data from table 2 and then, especially, data from table 4, it is clear to see the steady increase in the period of the pendulum along with the length of rope on each graph.  because the error bars are small enough that they don’t overlap, as well, it can be determined that the length of the rope does impact the period of the pendulum.

          the experiment with the mass of the object as the independent variable addressed the research question by keeping the other variables constant while the mass was changed each trial to try to determine if the mass of the object had any affect on how long it took the pendulum to complete on period.  after the experiment, our group determined that the mass of the object didn’t have an impact on the period of the pendulum.  the trendline of the data only has a slope of -0.0008, showing that there is almost no change in the period of the pendulum as the mass of the object increases.  additionally, the error bars on the graph clearly overlap so it can’t be concluded that there is any relationship between the mass of the object and the period of the pendulum.

the theoretical model for the period of a pendulum (using meters) is $t=2$ or t because the square root of the acceleration of gravity is about the same value as pi so they can cancel each other out.  our mathematical model is similar, .  the exponent is nearly the same, and the only reason our number before the variable is different from the theoretical equation is because we used centimeters instead of meters.  our mathematical model produced from the lab data supports the theoretical model because they both utilize the power function and have similar values for the constants.  the x value in this equation is the length of the rope, as the angle of release and mass of the object didn’t have any significant affect on the period of the pendulum.  

some possible random errors that could have affected our results were the timing could be off a little bit because of different reaction times for every trial, holding the protractor or the rope at slightly the wrong angle, or misreading the measurement on the tape measure.  one way we tried to avoid random error with the stopwatch was to have the same person keep track of the time each trial so that they would have a similar reaction time for each one.  once we got to the last lab, though, we were able to utilize the photogate so that there wouldn’t be any random errors from the stopwatch at all.  the best we could do to avoid holding the protractor or rope at the wrong angle was to try to communicate to each other if everything was lined up perfectly or as perfect as possible.  and in order to decrease the random error of misreading the tape measure, we had multiple people check to see the measurement so we knew it was correct.  there could have been systematic errors as well, such as the protractor or the tape measure being slightly off, but it would have been difficult to notice these or prevent them from affecting our data.

in the experiments we performed, the largest length we tested was 154 cm so our mathematical model is only generalizable to pendulum lengths no longer than 154 cm.  similarly, the largest mass we could test was 250 g and the largest angle that we released the pendulum from was 45 degrees, so anything past these variables’ values could not be generalized.
