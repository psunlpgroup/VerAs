discussion and conclusion



the purpose of this lab was to help familiarize students with an introduction to experimental design, error analysis, and mathematical models. we did this by asking the research question is  what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? using the dependent variable as the period of the swing and the independent variables as is  the length of string, mass of pendulum, and angle of release. 

 looking at the table 4 and figure 1 , we can conclude that the length of the string does affect the period of the pendulum. figure 1 shows that the graph fits the power curve with a model of $y=1.0463562 x$. this is closely similar to the theoretical mathematical model of $y=0.8464 x$. based on the theoretical mathematical model of a pendulum with the length of 0.50m, it would have a period of 1.42s. compared to the experimental the value of 1.44s, which gives us a percent error of 1.41%. in figures 2 and 3, we can see that each trendline fits a linear model, which is incorrect to the mathematical model intended as a power curve. since the length of string is the only factor that fits with the theoretical mathematical model, we can conclude that the length of the string is the independent variable that affects the period of the pendulum. the mass of pendulum and the angle of release has no impact on the period of the pendulum.

there are many possible systematic and random errors that may have influenced the outcome of this experiment. random errors may include that the stopwatch only records to centiseconds, weights and pendulum weight may have been worn down from years of use, the string on the pendulum could have been stretched out also from being used for long periods of time. possible ways to reduce or limit random error is using technology to make more accurate measurements, obtain brand new weights and new string each time the experiment was ran. systematic errors that may have resulted are reflex responses on pressing the stop watch or not perfectly having consistency on measuring to the middle of the bob when each weight was added. possible ways to reduce or limit systematic error includes is  using technology to accurate stop the time when needed and having a ruler to measure and mark each middle of the bob when weights are added.

constraints in this experiment that may limit accuracy is the amount of trials taken in each test. having more time to add more trials may change the data or make measurements more accurate.
