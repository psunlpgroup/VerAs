discussion and conclusions: 

	the purpose of this lab was to demonstrate how an applied force can affect the acceleration of a pulley system. based on the graph in figure 1, we were able to conclude that the force applied to a system affects its acceleration. the graph shows a positive correlation, so as the force increases, so does the acceleration. in our lab, we found our experimental model to be is  $a=0.005 x - 0.0121$ where a is the acceleration and x is equal to the hanging force of the pulley. the slope of this equation, 0.005, is equal to one divided by the mass of the system. the y-intercept is equal to the unknown forces divided by the mass of the system. based on this, we were able to determine a theoretical model of is  $a =\frac{f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$. if we re-write our original experimental model to fit the theoretical model, we get is  $a =\frac{f_{hanging}}{200} -\frac{2.42}{200}$. if someone were to plug in actual values for the hanging force into this equation, they could see how the force affects the acceleration. in the theoretical model, there is a variable noted as the unknown force. this variable is contributed to any other type of force acting on the pulley that is not the applied force. for example, tension, frictional force, etc. this variable is also the reason that the y-intercept is not zero in the experimental model.

	other groups in lab had similar results to ours. by looking at figures 2 and 3, both groups have graphs that show a positive correlation, just as ours did. the experimental models were not exact, due to measurement differences, but still show that the force applied affects the acceleration of a system. 

 	in the lab, there were likely a few errors. one error could have been in the balance used to weigh the system. if the balance was not calibrated correctly, the mass would be off. to correct this, we would have to use a more accurate balance. another error could have been from data studio. if the systems used for measurement from data studio were not set up correctly, the data could have been construed. to fix this, careful attention needs to be paid to the setup of the experiment or a more accurate program could be used. other things that could have constrained our results is the fact that the pulley system may not have been completely frictionless. also, the tracks also seemed to have been tilted slightly, which cause other unknown forces to act on the system.
