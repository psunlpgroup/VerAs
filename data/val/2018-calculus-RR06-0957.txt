discussion and conclusion
in this experiment, the change in acceleration of the cart due to the applied force on the system was tested and the relationship was found. to determine this relationship, the mass of the entire system was kept constant, but the hanging mass was changed as the independent variable. this hanging weight corresponds to the applied force acting on the cart that causes the acceleration. the air track reduced the coefficient of friction so that the only major force acting on the cart was the force of gravity on the hanging mass. as shown by figure 1, there is a positive linear relationship between the applied force and acceleration of the cart. based on the uncertainty (error bars) and standard deviation, there is a clear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. no values are within, or close to, 2 standard deviation units. the relationship, therefore, is not the result of random error.  
the mathematical model, based on the data in table 2, is $y=4.9792 x - 0.0085$ where y represents the acceleration in cm/s2, x represents the applied force, 4.9792 corresponds the 1/masssystem, and 0.0085 represents the (unknown force)/masssystem. this graph has an r2 value of 0.9988, which is relatively high. this model supports our initial predication of a positive, linear relationship between the applied force and acceleration of the cart.
this mathematical model is supported by the data from “team ram rod.” their data resulted in a mathematical model of $y=4.2433 x - 0.004$ and an r2 value of 0.9937. the mathematical model from group nog also supports our data. they found the mathematical relationship to be $y=4.815 x - 0.14$ and a r2 value of 0.9891. 
each of our mathematical models have a coefficient between 4 and 5 that represents 1/masssystem, as well as a small negative y-intercept that corresponds to the unknown forces/masssystem. one possible unknown force would be friction. this makes sense because the force would be acting in the opposite direction of the acceleration. the air track greatly reduced the friction force, but there is still friction between the cart and the air. 
the theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by a single force is $f_a=m a$, or $a=\frac{f_a}{m}$. if there is only one force acting on the system, that force divided by the mass will be the acceleration. the mathematical model was found by the best fit line of the data. in the data, there was some friction that was accounted for in the mathematical model, but the 4.9792x represents fa/mass, or the acceleration not considering the unknown force. the theoretical equation for the acceleration of the system by more than one force is $f=m a$. $f  = f_a + f_{unknown}$. this is supported by the experimental model because the fa is represented by the x, this force is divided by the mass in the coefficient (1/msssystem) and the rest of the forces (funknown) divided by the mass of the system is represented by the -0.0085. 
in the experiment, a light weight string was used so that as the string was pulled down with the hanging mass, the mass of the string did not greatly increase the hanging mass. if the string was much heavier, however, the more the string is pulled down by the hanging mass, the more mass is being pulled down by gravity, and therefore the greater the force that is being applied to the system. this would cause an increasing net force as the cart accelerated towards the pulley. the acceleration would no longer be a constant acceleration, but rather an increasing acceleration as the net force increases.
the major constraint on this experiment is the small range of hanging masses used. this experiment only used the combined masses of up to 8 bobbers as the hanging weight. the maximum hanging mass, therefore, was 0.0376 kg, which is relatively small. the results of this experiment can only be generalized for systems with applied forces less than 0.0376*9.8, which is 0.3685 n.
uncertainty is represented by error bars. horizontal error bars for figures 1 were based on the standard deviation for the force applied. this was found to be +0.0005kg, ½ of the smallest unit of measurement for the mass (1 g). th vertical error bars represent the standard deviation of the data collected from datastudio, +.0061. the statistical interpretation of 1 standard deviation is that 68% of future measurements should be within 1 standard deviation of the mean. the statistical relevance of 2 standard deviation is 95% of future measurements fall within this range. random error in this experiment could come from inconsistent air flow through the air track or slight differences in the datastudio measurements. to reduce this random error, three trials at each independent variable were performed and the resulting measurements were averaged. in future experiments, more trials could be run at each independent variable. systematic error could have come from an uncalibrated scale or an air track that had a slight incline. if the scale consistently measured weights as too light or too heavy, the resulting measurements would have systematic error. to reduce this, one mass could be measured on two different scales to approximate the accuracy of the scale. another systematic error would result from the air track not being exactly horizontal, the force applied by the hanging mass would not be the only downward force on the cart.
