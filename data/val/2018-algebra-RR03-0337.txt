discussion and conclusion

the question that was answered was which of the factors: length of the string, mass of the load, and the angle of release effected the period of the pendulum the most? there were three main factors involved and they were the length of the string, mass of the load, and the angle of release. these factors were used to test which impacted the period of the pendulum the most. as a group these were the three factors that were used above. 

the angle of release vs period had independent variables which were 5, 10, 15, and 30 degrees, and these were used to find out if they effected the period at all. there is a lot that can be said about this but the equation we got from graph 1 is  is $y=0.0067 x + 1.0753$. there was a lot of human error involved in this because we were holding a protractor while timing, which was hard. our graph 1 shows us that it’s going down and then increasing, then going down, and then increasing again. our error bars show us that our data was incorrect due to human error, and we can claim that the angle of release does not affect the period. 

	the changing of the length of the string vs period had the independent variables which were 10,80,120, and 180 cm, and these were used to find out if it affected the period at all. the equation that was got from graph 2 is  is $y=0.2569 x^{0.4405}$ which got the r^2 value of .99992 which shows that it’s highly accurate. the graph also has very small error bars because of how accurate our data was. there was human error involved in this test, but it didn’t make much of a difference because we can claim that the length of the string does affect the time of the period. 

	the changing of the mass vs period has the independent variables that were 50, 110, 170, and 250 grams, these were used to grind out if it affected the period at all. the equation that was got from graph 3 was $y=0.0614 x + 0.118$ and the r^2 value that was got was .82122. this was accurate but it wasn’t accurate as we wanted it to be. this was because of human error. the error bars were very large for this one. so, we can claim that the mass has no effect on the period. 

	the changing of the length of the string vs period with the machine had the independent variables which were 10,25,40,55,70,85,100,115,130, and 145 cm, and these were used to find if the length of the string affected the period at all or not. graph 4 is  had the equation $y=0.3447 x^{0.39}$ with the r^2 value of .9833 which shows that it was very accurate. this graph had very small error ball, which are barely visible. from this data, we can claim that the length of the string does effect the period of pendulum. 

	the theoretical model was $t=\frac{2 n}{\sqrt{g}} l^1/2$. g is the acceleration of the gravity, t is the length of the period, and l is the length of the pendulum. the equation in graph 4 is  $y=0.3447 x^{390}$ with r^2 .9833 which makes it very accurate. the variables in the equation is the period and length of the string. 

some random error that could have been plausible is that someone could have bumped the table while we were doing trials. the dropper arms can also could have been bumped causing a problem. we did this experiment on a thursday when it was raining, so when it thunders the vibration could have caused some error. systematic error could be the angle of release of the weights, which is effected by human error. also, the drop location wasn’t the same every time. also, another systematic error could be the string stretching since it was cheap string. the stopwatches could also have human error. also, the protractor could have human error because we were just holding it up there. another systematic error could have been that the weights weren’t hundred percent accurate since they were old. time was a constraint that was a problem because we couldn’t get a lot of data points, so it would’ve been better if we had more time. we kind of had to rush for data points. more time would have resulted in better data and more accurate data.
