conclusion:

	the main purpose for this lab consisted of developing mathematical models that would emulate a real-life system as well as gain an understanding for what each constant and variable represented.

	for the first experiment, we observed the change in acceleration of the car as the mass was distributed from the car to the bobbers hanging off, without changing the mass of the system. this experiment resulted in the plot shown in graph 1 for force, and graph 2 for mass. this gave us an r^2 value that was close to 1, thus solidifying our data. based on these graphs, we were able to develop the two models shown above (model 1 and model 2) where f represents force, m represents mass, and a represents acceleration. the + c value at the end of model 1 essentially considers all external factors. in our other experiment, we observed the change in acceleration as the mass was distributed from the car to the hanging string once again. however, this time we collected four measurements for a different backwards tilt on the system. based on our findings, it was evident that tilt had no true effect on the acceleration of the car if the system was frictionless, which was not at all what we had anticipated.

	as seen in graph 8, another group (the ta) calculated data for the acceleration of the system vs friction. based on their findings, friction did influence the system is  as the friction was increased, the resulting acceleration of the car decreased. in the model listed above, the f represented the force applied and the +c value represented the constant for outside factors affecting the system.

	in both experiments, the r^2 value indicated that the error was not very great within our experiment. however, it did still exist, and the explanation behind it was most likely random error. our data points were slightly off on both sides of the trendline, and this could have been due to varying weights of the bobbers, or a slight applied force when releasing the car to record the data. this would increase the value of the + c, because it would be considered an external factor. in order to reduce error, we could have turned the air track on and off when recording the data, rather than holding and releasing it ourselves. this would limit human interaction, and most likely increase our r^2 value. we also could have used a more accurate tool for measuring the weights of the bobbers, rather than a simple balance.

	some constraints that may limit the generalizability of our results could be the constraint of earth’s gravity only, a mass that does not exceed 339.8 grams, only considering frictional forces from the magnets, and a tilt that does not exceed 9 mm. 

	the mathematical models we created are consistent with newton’s second law ($f=m a$ because the m value in our model represents the acceleration, and the f represents the force applied which we calculated from the mass*gravity ($f=m g$). since we found these two values, the models are consistent with newton’s second law, however, the difference comes into play with the + c value. since there were some uncontrollable affecting the system, we had to account for this in our equation for it to successfully coincide with newton’s second law.
