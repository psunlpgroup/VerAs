conclusions.

	the first experiment is to find out whether string length would impact pendulum period. we attached a starting 150 grams weight to the end of the string and made the angle of release to be 30 degrees. then we change different lengths of strings and let go. also, we timed the number of seconds that it took the pendulum to complete one period. from the graph, we can know that the data we collected can form a power series graph, and the data are both dotted closely on the graph, it’s the only graph we can determine a relationship from this claim is valid.

	the second experiment is to find out whether pendulum mass would impact its period. we made a 40 cm string and make the angle of release to be 30 degrees. then we change the mass of pendulums and let go. we timed the number of seconds that it took the pendulum to complete on period. from the graph, it shows that the data are distributed much more randomly than the other two graphs and we can know that the coefficient of determination is small. this claim is not valid.

	the third experiment is to find out whether angles of leasing would impact pendulum period. we made a 30 cm string and attached a starting 50 grams weight to the end of it. then we held different angles and let go. we timed the number of seconds that it took the pendulum to complete one period.  from the graph, we can find that the data don’t dot very close to the graph, and the graph is not about the power series. this claim is not valid.

	our graph which is about string length mimics the shape of the graph that in class. 2pi square root l/g is the in-class equation and we got a power series graph by our equation is   $t=2.0305 l^{0.4905}$. this is almost equivalent to the original equation. as our pendulum got longer the amount of time directly increased. the amount of time directly decreased as the pendulum got smaller. the graphs in the other two experiments are both cannot from a power series graph, it’s easy to find out their equations are different from the original equation.

	the systematic error is that the weights have been off by a certain degree of mass. we could use other tools like stickers to make the string could secure the rope better on the center. the random errors are is  the angle could have been off by a certain degree measure due to human error, and the time record error due to human error. to reduce the error which is made by degree differences, we can make the bottom of protractor parallel to the horizontal plane better. to reduce the error which is made by time record, we changed to use an electronic camera to track time so the results could be much more accurate.

	the systematic error might limit the generalizability of our results. the systematic error is the weights could have been off by a certain degree of mass.
