conclusion 

the purpose of this lab was to identify how the length, angle of release, and mass of the pendulum affect its pendulum. from the data collected, we were able to find that length is the only factor from the ones we tested that affects the period. this conclusion was formed since length was the only data found two differ by one standard deviation or more from each length we tested. as you can see in figure 1, the error bars are very small which means very little of the change from point to point is attributed by timing error. this concludes that the positive relationship between length and period was significant factor not attributed to an error in measurement. since angle and mass do not differ by more than one standard deviation from one characteristic to the next, we can attribute the changing averages due to the stopwatch timing error. therefore, angle and mass do not affect the period. this can be seen in figure 2 and figure 3 since the error bars for point of each graph encompass all the data points. 

we found the equation to determine the period to be .  this supports our claim that length is the only factor from the ones we tested that effects the period since length is in the equation. when comparing this value to one we tested we found that at 30 cm the theoretical period would be 1.099 seconds and our found value was 1.20 seconds. this is a 9.19% error. we later found the reason for such the high rate of error was due to the measurement of the string. we found that we were not including the length of the hangar which was 8.5 cm. after recalculating we found that our pendulum length in test 1 was actual 38.5 cm. after recalculating, we found the error to be 3.6%. to help with the calculations, 8.5 cm was added to all the lengths to determine the correct theoretical period. 

for this experiment, we could not test the pendulum at extreme limits. due to height constraints we could only test lengths of 158.5 cm. also, we only had a limited amount of mass for the hangar. if this test were to be conducted again, the values tested would have to be much larger to ensure that the conclusions found are true even at extreme scenarios.
