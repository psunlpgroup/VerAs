discussion/conclusion



the main question being researched in this experiment was, what variables effect the period of a pendulum? the first experiment tested was string length versus the time of a pendulums period. through this experiment we were able to gather data that showed that the string length of a pendulum did affect the period of the swing. this was likely because the times measured varied for each sting length. looking at the data from tables 2 and figure 1 it can be seen that there is a difference between measured time and string length for each trial. figure 1 shows the standard error bars and it can been seen that there is very little overlap between the bars. it can be concluded that the shorter the string length the shorter the period of the pendulum.

the second experiment tested was mass of a pendulum versus the time of a pendulums period. through this experiment we were able to gather data that showed that the mass of the pendulum of a pendulum did not affect the period of the swing. this was likely because the times measured did not vary much for each mass tested. looking at the data from tables 4 and figure 2  it can be seen that there is not a difference between measured time and mass for each trial. figure 2  shows the standard error bars and it can been seen that there is overlap between the bars. it can be concluded that the weight of the pendulum is not related to the period.

the third and final experiment tested was angle of release versus the time of a pendulums period. through this experiment we were able to gather data that showed that the angle of release did not affect the period of the swing. this was likely because the times measured did not vary much for each angle tested. looking at the data from tables 6 and figure 3  it can be seen that there is not a difference between measured time and angle of release for each trial. figure 3  shows the standard error bars and it can been seen that there is overlap between the bars. it can be concluded that the angel of release is not related to the period.

 lab 2 helped identify random and systematic errors that could have been created and how to eliminate them. this helped to confirm the idea that figure 2 and 3 did not show any significant change within trials. lab 3 was the test of the new hypothesis. after reviewing the results from the first experiment and using the knowledge gained from the second experiment on error, we did our final trail for the research question and conducted more trials of the experiment testing string length versus the time of the period. using more accurate time measurement tools, the photogate, and focusing on one independent variable a test was conducted that confirmed our new idea that the length of the sting affected the period (tables 7-8 and figure 4).

the theoretical model is $t=\frac{2 \pi l^{0.5}}{\sqrt{g}}$ and our mathematical model is $t=0.2711 x^{0.4438}$. these show similarity in the exponent and coefficient, which is what determines the curve of the graph. this deviates by vary little from the equation that was obtained after plotting and curve fitting the data (). to obtain this curve a square root relationship was used. comparing to the theoretical equation it is obvious that changing mass and initial angle would have no effect on the pendulum, as there is no value for the in the theoretical equation. 

some the random errors that were present in the experiment were not exact measurement while testing the angle of release, not exact stop watch measurement time, and varying ending points for oscillations. the systematic errors that could have existed were length of string could not have been at the exact desired height and a damaged stop watch. this could have shifted the data all one way or another because the error would all be consistent. this was also fixed in the lab 3 because of the use of the photogate. one factor that limits the generalizability is that this only applies for small angles of a pendulum. large angles may be different.
