discussion and conclusion 

the acceleration of a system is dependent upon the amount of mass or force that is exerted on it. throughout this experiment, a cart, the system, was placed on a track with a string attached around it and to one end. first, we applied the force of the mass, the bouncers, directly onto the cart itself. we made sure to add them in a varying order on each side of the cart to ensure our data would be correct. each trial we added more weight to the cart and the acceleration of the system decreased. then, we added hanging mass to the end of the string and increased the mass each trial. our results were that the heavier the hanging mass, the more acceleration the system had. referring to graph 1, as the hanging mass increases, the acceleration increases as shown with an upward sloping trend line. the error bars in graphs 1 and 2 show that the data we got was not 100 percent accurate, but pretty close. graph 2 was a little more off than graph 1 as there seemed to be more errors throughout these trials. graph 2 shows the mass of the cart versus acceleration with the results being a downward sloping trend line. the heavier the mass of the cart got, the less acceleration the system had. comparing graphs 1 and 2, the data correlates well and is accurate. when the mass of the system gets heavier, the acceleration will decrease. but when the hanging mass at the end of the string increases, the acceleration will also increase. all of graphs in experiment 3 show different trial runs of one constant increasing tilt on the track with an increase of the hanging mass. as the tilt of the track increased, the acceleration decreased. the trend in all of the graphs support the claim that as hanging mass increases, the acceleration of the system also does. this claim is easy to see in graphs 1 and 2 as the variables corresponded to directly prove this claim. but, we can also see in graphs 3 that as the hanging mass increases, the acceleration also does even though as the tilt increases, the acceleration decreases.

the equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ is the theoretical model used throughout the experiments.  “a” is the acceleration, “f” is the force, and “m” is the mass of the entire system. the theoretical model is slightly adjusted in these experiments as seen in all of the graphs.  within these experiments, the equation $a=c1 w+c2$ was used.  c1 and c2 have uncertainties added to them, thus making it a very accurate equation to use.  the theoretical equation has slightly less precise results due to no uncertainties being added.  however, the most precise theoretical model is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$.  when looking at the equation, there is more forces added in than the previous equations thus rendering the most accurate result.  it incorporates the applied force, the external force, the mass of the systems, and all of its uncertainties to obtain the most precise results.  when referring to all of the graphs, it is shown that they do support the theoretical model.  

if the string between the cart and the hanging mass had increased in weight, the results would dramatically increase.  the surface area on the sensor would increase in size and acceleration would increase but at a slower rate.  for reference, a string as heavy as a chain link would most definitely change results.  mass would also still be added at the end, again increasing the acceleration.  random error occurred throughout the lab.  air was a random error due to factors such as gusts from people walking by.  this could have been prevented by making a barrier of sorts to prevents certain gusts affecting the falling mass.  another random error could have occurred when starting and stopping the sled.  if it was released slightly before or after the program started, it could have screwed some results.  this could have been reduced by starting and stopping the program before and after the release of the sled.  finally, systematic could have happened when measuring the masses due to it not being completely accurate.  this could have been reduced by using multiple scares throughout the experiment.  every experiment has constraints.  the constraints included here could have been the masses and the string.  string has mass even though it was considered without mass in the experiments.  also, the mass of the bobbers was assumed to have been the same but could have been slightly different in weight.  the bobbers were not able to be measured do to the lack of accuracy in the scales.
