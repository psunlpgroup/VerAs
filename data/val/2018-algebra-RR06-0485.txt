	the research question being investigated during this lad was, how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes. in lab 05, our results showed that the hanging weight on the cart had an effect on the overall acceleration of the system. during lab, we had originally predicted that this would be a linear relationship and after performing the lab it proved to be true. this is shown through the graph in figure 1. since this is a linear relationship, it implies that as the applied force increases on the system, as will the acceleration. when looking at the data provided from groups a and b, we can conclude that our testable hypothesis is true. our testable hypothesis stated that, “applied force will change the acceleration of the object”. both graphs for a and b also show a linear relationship of the system. each of the three graphs contain error bars. the purpose of which is to show the uncertainty of the system. for all the graphs, the data showed that the uncertainty was less than 1. from this, we can conclude that there was little to no error in the measurements done during this lab when the force and acceleration of the systems were calculated. this again further proves our original prediction that the weight of the system would change the applied force, which in turn changes the acceleration of the system. the theoretical yield of the system is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. for our model, we found that the mass of the hanging item(s) needed to be 0.18 kg when trying to achieve an acceleration of 0.55 m/s2. the equation used to determine this was as follows is  ((0.55*296.5+5(5.1)/(9.8)) which is 18 g0.18 kg. we found the experimental mathematical model to be $y=4.0483 x+ 0.0536$. in our model, x is representative of m*1g from the preferred model. the y-intercept is in place of the value for 1 for the preferred model which represents the sums of the masses of the system in our experiment. so with this we can conclude that the heavier the string, the greater the applied force on the system; the greater the applied force on the system, the greater the acceleration. if the string were lighter, it would have the opposite effect on the system. proof of these statements was done by plugging larger and smaller numbers into the experimental equation and analyzing the results. 

	during each lab there are two kinds of error is  random and systematic. systematic error could have occurred if our balance was not correctly calibrated-it would have given us incorrect masses. to reduce systematic error, make sure all of the lab equipment is working effectively and calibrated before the start of data collection. random error is due to human error. something that could have been done during this lab to produce random error was rounding mistakes when calculating the hanging weight needed. to reduce random error, be consistent in all measuring throughout the lab.
