discussion/conclusion: 



the purpose of this experiment was to determine if applied force affects the acceleration of a system. the mathematical model that $y=4.548 x + 0.038$ as shown on the graph in figure 1. this mathematical model doesn’t agree with the theoretical model because the theoretical model says $f= m a$. our mathematical model was calculated by using the applied force by total mass of the system which was 187.36 g. as shown by figure 4, $a=\frac{f}{m}$ and m was calculated as 0.33468 kg and a was calculated as 0.53 . the measured acceleration was calculated as 0.49+/- 0.1 . the uncertainty that was calculated as 0.001 which was calculated from data studios because the error bars of the graph are too small to see. the acceleration was measured by data studios program for each of the five trials that were conducted. during each trial the force was increased each time while keeping the mass of the total system a constant which was 187.36 g. as shown by figure 1, as amount of force that was placed on the cart increased and the acceleration of the cart increased as well. 

as shown in figure 2 and figure 3, other data from other groups showed that acceleration was increased as the among of force on the system was increased. both groups had a linear graph showing the positive relationship between these two variables which was like the linear relationship conducted by my group. the theoretical models as shown by table 3 were like the data of my group. however, the mathematical models were not. such as, table 3 shows that the masses of the system that was used were different than the one used by my group. as shown by table 3, the mathematical model that was calculated by my group had a larger slope than the other two groups. this could just be from a small calculation error possibly from converting units. the slopes of group 5 and group 1 were close in value. these groups therefore, support the claim that applied force affects the acceleration. 

	some environmental factors that may be present are the surface has is frictionless. the apparatus that is used for measuring could have some error in measurements. there was also some wind-resistance. if there was a heavier string that was involved it would cause the acceleration to increase because that would include more force being forced on the cart. some random errors that could have occurred is if there was an error is measurement of the mass of the system. these random errors were reduced by having different people take the mass of the system. some systematic errors that could occur is if the scale isn’t zeroed or if there is a delay in the sensor. a constraint that could have occurred is only using one type of string and the same type of scale. such as, if there was also a digital scale that was provided it could reduce some error in the measurements.
