discussion and conclusion:



the purpose of this lab was to determine what impacts the period of a pendulum. the independent variables we decided to test were the angle of release, mass and the length of the string. the first variable tested was the angle of release. our findings suggest that the angle of release does not impact the period of a pendulum. looking back to lab 01, we can see the time values do not largely vary when the angle of release is changed (figure 1). however, we do see fluctuations within the graph (figure 2), so we completed lab 02 by removing out random errors such as inaccurate angle measurements and improper stop watch times as well as systematic errors which include stopping/starting the stopwatch too early or late. based off lab 02’s table (figure 7) as well as graph (figure 8) we see consistent time values in the 1.7 second range for the various angle of release values. we also see that a simple trendline cannot be drawn through the data points or the error bars, meaning there is no correlation between the independent variable (angle) and the dependent variable (time). the error bars seen on the graph in lab 02 were perfectly fit to the fixed value of 0.001. the error bars also do not overlap suggesting that there are random errors within our measurements. the standard deviation however is 0.016, showing there is only a small variance between the data and the statistical average. this demonstrates a low amount of uncertainties and overall reliable data. in conclusion, our original hypothesis that states the period of a pendulum is impacted by the angle of release can thus be rejected. 

the second variable tested was mass. our findings suggest that the mass does not impact the period of a pendulum. looking back to lab 01, we can see the time values do not largely vary when the mass is changed (figure 3). however, we do see a large amount of fluctuations within the graph (figure 4), so we completed lab 02 by removing out random errors such as improper stop watches times as well as systematic errors which include stopping/starting the stopwatch too early or late. based off lab 02’s table (figure 9) as well as graph (figure 10) we see consistent time values in the 1.8 second range for the various mass values. we also see that a simple trendline can be drawn however it only passes through one data point and three error bars, leaving nine data points and seven error bars out of place meaning there is no correlation between the independent variable (mass) and the dependent variable (time). the error bars seen on the graph in lab 02 were perfectly fit to the fixed value of 0.001. the error bars also do not overlap suggesting that there are random errors within our measurements. the standard deviation however is 0.027, showing there is only a small variance between the data and the statistical average. this demonstrates a low amount of uncertainties and overall reliable data. in conclusion, our original hypothesis that states the period of a pendulum is impacted by the mass can be rejected. based of labs 01 and 02, we were able to conclude the angle of release and mass have no impact on the time it takes for a pendulum to complete a period and were disregarded for lab 03

the final variable tested was the length of string. our findings suggest that the length of the string on a pendulum does impact the period of a pendulum. looking back to lab 01, we can see the time values vary when the angle of release is changed in the table (figure 5) as well as the graph (figure 6). we then completed lab 02 by removing out random errors such as inaccurate angle measurements and improper stop watch times as well as systematic errors which include stopping/starting the stopwatch too early or late and the improper measuring of the string. based off lab 02’s table (figure 11) as well as graph (figure 12) we see differing time values once again for the various string length values. we also see that a simple trendline can be drawn through the data points and error bars, showing a positive correlation between the independent variable (length of string) and the dependent variable (time). the error bars seen on the graph in lab 02 were too small to see with the fixed value of 0.001 thus we moved the fixed value up to the standard deviation value and saw larger error bars. the error bars also overlap suggesting that there are very little random errors but possible more systematic errors within our measurements. the standard deviation is 0.296, showing there is only a small variance between the data and the statistical average. this demonstrates a low amount of uncertainties and overall reliable data. in conclusion, our original hypothesis that states the period of a pendulum is impacted by the length of a string can be accepted. based of labs 01 and 02, we were able to conclude the length of string has an impact on the time it takes for a pendulum to complete a period and this variable was further analyzed in lab 03. in lab 03, the values of figure 13 and figure 14 show similar to labs 01 and 02. through these values it became evident that the mathematical dependence was nonlinear and the trendline was a power line that fit through nearly all data points and error bars. an equation relating the independent variable to the dependent variable was also found and is in the form of tim$e=0.98833116 l$. an r2 value was also found and determined the data to be overall consistent.

the theoretical mathematical model provided was $t =2$  l/g. with the length of string being the only variable that effects the period of a pendulum as well as the only variable that fits a power curve, its suggested that the length of string versus time graph is the only one that fits the theoretical model. 

like any lab with limited equipment, constraints are present and may impact the results. one constraint was the limited time to complete the labs. with more time more trials could have been completed and its possible that with more time, less errors could have occurred. another constraint is the choice of materials used to create the pendulum. for example, a looser string or shape of the weight might have affected the results.
