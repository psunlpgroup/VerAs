discussion and conclusion: 

	in these labs, the question “what effects the period of a pendulum” was tested.  when testing if the mass affects the period of a pendulum, the mass was the independent variable because it was able to be controlled and known for each trial in the experiment.  although the error bars overlap each other, it is hard to definitively prove if the hypothesis tested was correct or not; however, since they do overlap and the slope from the graph is small, it can be said that the mass does not affect the period of a pendulum.  in each trial, the acceleration acting on the pendulum is the same regardless of what the mass is because the experiment was performed on earth.  therefore, no matter how large the mass, as long as the string is able to withstand the tension force of the weight, the time to complete one period is the same.  

	the length of a string was the independent variable when testing if the length affects the period of a pendulum.  this is because the length can be controlled for each trial in the experiment.  since the error bars overlap each other in the day one of lab, the hypothesis tested cannot be proved or disproved based on these results.  however, based on the data from the results of day three, it can be said that length does in fact affect the length of a period.  this is because as the length, or radius of the string, increases the distance the pendulum needs to travel increases based on the circumference formula, circumference equals two times the radius times pi.  the acceleration, angle of release, and mass do not change, so the only thing affecting the time of the period would be the length.  

	the angle of release was the independent variable in testing if the angle of release affects the period of a pendulum.  this is because the angle of release can be changed and controlled for each trial in the experiment, unlike time which cannot be changed or controlled.  since the error bars overlap each other in the graph, the hypothesis mentioned in the experimental details cannot be definitively proved or disproved.  however, since the data points are close together and the slope of the line is very small, it can be said that the angle of release does not affect the period of a pendulum when the angle is less than thirty degrees.  for this experiment it was asked that angles less than thirty degrees be tested.  as the angle of release increases, there is more room for the pendulum to accelerate versus when the angle of release is smaller. 

	when looking at the graph of the length versus period for day three of the lab, the line of best fit for the trend line is a side opening parabola.  the equation from the graph is $t=1.0080693 l$ which is very similar to other groups data as listed above and it is similar to the actual equation for finding the period of a pendulum, $t=\frac{2.0 \pi l}{g}$.  this shows that the data from this graph very much supports the theoretical model.  random errors in this experiment include human errors such as is  letting only one person time the period and letting the pendulum swing back and forth only once.  this first error listed can be fixed by letting more than one person time the period of the pendulum then taking the average of those times.  this will reduce the error caused by each person’s reaction time.  the second error listed can be fixed by letting the pendulum swing more than once back and forth.  it was thought that if the pendulum swung more than one time back and forth and then dividing the time by the number of times it would swing would change the time it takes for a period.  this is not true because as the period swings longer the time it takes to swing decreases but the distance that the swing covers after a longer period of time also decreases which compensates itself.  since there was a random error in testing with the stop watches, it is hard to definitively tell if there was a systematic error in the stopwatches or not.  constraints to this experiment would include equipment.  the photogate was not provided until the third lab, which takes away from the ability to determine the accuracy of the mass and angle of release tests.  this photogate eliminates the reaction time from a human with a stop watch, can quickly and accurately find the time of period of a pendulum.  this is accurate to 0.001 seconds.  after performing this experiment, we learned of better techniques that would help reduce the error in the results if this lab needed to be repeated.  overall, this experiment tested different variables that could affect the period of a pendulum and from those tests, it was determined that length was the only variable out of the three tested that affected the period of a pendulum.
