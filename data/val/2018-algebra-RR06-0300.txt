discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of this lab was to investigate how the acceleration is affected by a changing in the applied force. this purpose lead us to ask the question is  how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? with the question set, we set out to answer this question. using an airtrack and metal cart, we were able to find the time and velocity of the cart using data studio. the acceleration was then found from this data using the slope. the way we determined the applied force was the mass of the hanging bobs multiplied by 9.18 (or gravity). this resulted in the applied force that we graphed vs acceleration in figure 1. from the data that is listed out above in table 2 and figure 1, we achieved a mathematical model of $y=0.005 x - 0.0563$. the accompanying trendline is very strong as it follows the data very closely. this line shows a positive correlation, indicating that as the applied force was increased, the acceleration also increased, which corresponds with our hypothesis. there is also the general theoretical equation that is $f=m_{sys} a$. the two equations relate in how the theoretical equation shows the general way to find acceleration. this is further supported by the mathematical model as this equation is a representation of this theoretical system. the error bars were also so small, meaning the uncertainty for this data is very low. the error bars are unable to be seen, indicating that the data is accurate, and we can be confident in the strength of the data. this also answers the research question as we now see how the applied force affects the acceleration.  additionally, we were not the only group to come to this conclusion. below are two other group’s findings that portray the same findings is 


both groups concluded that as the force applied due to the hanging mass increases, the acceleration also increases. there mathematical models are $y= 0.053 x-0.0443$ and $y= 0.004 x+0.1097$, respectively. the mathematical model we found is $y=0.005 x - 0.0563$. all three of these models seem to be very similar in values, showing a consistent conclusion. also, all the graphs shown resemble each other as they have a positive slope and show a positive correlation. from these mathematical models, the theoretical model we found is 

$a= \frac{f_{hang}}{m_{sys}}+ \frac{f_{unk}}{m_{ss}}$. using the mathematical model as a template ($y=m x+b$), we see that each part of the theoretical corresponds to the part in the mathematical models. for example, the y is equal to the acceleration. so, with this theoretical model come some unfamiliar values. funk is one of these values as it represents the other forces acting upon the system. in this case, it is likely friction and any other error such as an uneven air track. the mass of the system affects almost all parts of the model as it is part of the independent variable. it is most visible as it is msys, which corresponds to the slope of the line as well as in the unknown force discussed earlier. but what if there was a string with a noticeable mass? the non-massless string connects the two parts of the system but still does not affect the uniform motion. the mass would be increased in the applied force (mg), but the uniform motion would still stay consistent with a string with some mass as the applied force would still be consistent throughout the drop. even through careful procedure there are still likely some errors. some systematic errors could be that the air track was not completely perpendicular to the floor, potentially causing the acceleration to be higher or lower based on how the track laid. there is also systematic error due to friction which will slow the cart. if there was no friction, which is very hard to achieve, the last part of the theoretical model (funk/msys) would be zero. a random error could be that the same protocol was not followed on each trial. even though we believed to do the procedure the exact same way each time, there were likely minute differences. lastly, this lab could be generalized to many scenarios. some equipment may have to be altered to cope with certain parameters. for example, if the cart is large enough and has a large mass, it may not move much because the air track can’t give the cart any lift due to the weight. this would likely be considered friction, so a more powerful air track may have to be used to counteract the large mass that is being used. in this case the constraints are largely friction. so, the system we used can be generalized to similar scenarios. with this being said, the results can be applied to several scenarios. in general, as applied force is increased, the acceleration also increases. this is true for a system with a constant total mass, if mass is added, the acceleration will likely decrease. therefore, these results can only be generalized to similar scenarios. these findings can be seen daily and supports our conclusion of how an increased force increases acceleration. through several investigators exploring the world of forces and acceleration, we have found that with an increased applied force, the acceleration will uniformly increase.
