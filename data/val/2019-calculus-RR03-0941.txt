discussion & conclusion

	the research question to be answered with data obtained from this series of labs was, “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?”. this question was to be interpreted, hypothesized, tested, and confirmed, in that order. the answer to the research question was supposed to be built upon as more progress was made.

	the first lab period formed the basis of the following labs and was focused on the gathering of raw data which would later be refined. the main goal of this session was to determine the variables for the experiment, hypothesize, and run initial tests with these variables in place. the initial tests provided insight into what the final results of the experiment may be. some of the data taken from the tests were too varied to know the exact results. such was the case in the tests of mass and release angle, where it was uncertain if the small changes in period length were due to the change of the independent variable or due to errors in timing. in the tests of both varying mass and varying release angle there were no observed trends. however, varying the length of the string showed a strong upward trend regardless of imperfect timings. this was hypothesized before the tests were ran with outside knowledge from physics lectures.

	the second lab period was concerned with identifying imperfections in the experimental process and ways to fix them. there were two types of errors present in the process, these being systematic and random error. the identified systematic errors were is  inaccurate measuring devices, zeroing beam balance, latency of the stopwatch button, and parallax. the identified random errors were is  reaction time of the time recorder, varied release of the bob, determination of the termination point of the period, parallax, and air drag. the methods for reducing these errors can be found below is
