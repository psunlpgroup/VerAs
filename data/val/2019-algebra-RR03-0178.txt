discussion and conclusions:

the research question for this lab was to answer the question between length of the string and the period of a pendulum. during this lab we tested 3 different things is  the mass of the weight at the bottom, the length of the string and the angle at which the weight was dropped at. claims we made were that the mass of the object at the bottom of the string had little to no affect on the period of the pendulum. we also concluded that the angle of decent only makes minor differences in the period and that the length of the string made a noticeable difference when you changed the length to the period of the entire pendulum. using the graphs, you can see those correlations in each graph. the most valid claim was that the length of the string has a direct correlation to the period of the pendulum. the mathematical model for the model of the string was a graph and when you do the math and average out the trials, we ran you can clearly see a difference in the averages for the different string lengths. we predicted that the mass would have no affect on the pendulums period and the results we gather supported that theory. we thought the angle would affect the period more than it did. the math averages that came out were much closer to each other than we expected. for the length we predicted it would have an affect on the pendulums period. this prediction was correct based on our data table and the math to support it.  some errors we had to be careful about was to make sure we dropped it from the same angle every time to make sure we did this we used a protracted every time to line it up at 50 degrees every time therefore there was less error. also, with the first test we were using stop watches to time the periods. we had two time keepers. however, even with two timers we still ran into a lot of human error, after repeating the experiment we used a photogate to help eliminate the human error factor. unfortunately, there was still going to be some human error in trying to click go on the photogate at the right time, we did our best to eliminate this by counting down but unfortunately there will always be a little bit of human error. a constraint we ran into was time, we were limited to the class time to perform the lab and if we were given more time in the lab, i think we would have been able to collect more precise data. also, we were given very limited materials if we were given better materials, we could have been able to keep everything the same way easier and eliminate more human error. another constraint we ran into was if we really wanted to test a bunch of different lengths, we were confined to a small area to conduct our experiment.
