conclusion:
through the course of these 3 labs and experiments, our measurements proved that the only variable that impacts the period of the pendulum’s swing, is the length of the string.  in the first experiment we tested the three factors, mass, string length, and the angle of the release.  looking at graph 1 it can be observed that the mass of the weight had no noticeable effect and so no correlation with the period.  the reason why there is no correlation is because the graph shows no relationship between them.  the points on the graph are spread out, they increase and decrease with different variation each time.  looking at graph 1, it can be seen that the length does affect the period of the swing, so as the length increases so does the period.  due to this, it can be claimed that the length of the string impacts the period.  this is because the graph displays a direct relationship between length of string and the period.  finally looking at graph 3, it can be seen that the angle has no effect on the period, we can see this because there is no correlation in the graph.  from experiment 1 we learned that length impacts the period.  in experiment 2, it was determined what could have caused errors in our measurements.  the deviation in our results could be a result in the mess up of timing, mis-measurement, calculation, or non-true values, or many other things.  using constant angle, mass, and length, we calculated our standard deviation for our time measurements.  this gave us the values needed to include error bars on our graphs.  this could be used to explain the variation in some of the values.  the timing errors could be due to human error as humans are not perfect when it comes to timing.  finally, in experiment 3, photogate was used to ensure that the length and period do correlate.  our results in graph 4 shows a machine’s values for measuring the period and it lines up with the around the same data as we saw in graph 2 where we measured the periods by hand.  the results in this experiment finalized our thoughts from experiment 1. 

we looked at the theoretical mathematical model which is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$.  this formula calculates the theoretical period of the pendulum.  our experimental mathematical model was $t=0.2018 l^{0.4985}$ for this experiment.  the length we used was 0.5 meters and the theoretical time was 1.419 seconds.  the actual value using our experimental model was 1.5 seconds, which is only 0.081 seconds off.  this helped to validate our values because the values produced by photogate were only slightly off those of our own measuring.  the power curve fit lines up with our data very well.  graph 4 displays our curve fit, data values, and mathematical model.  our theoretical model does not display/use the values of the angle of the release or the mass on the end of the string, therefore, we can conclude that they do not affect the period.  the model helps to validate the claims we previously made from experiment 1. 

	errors exist in most all experiments.  some of the errors that appeared in our experiments were our errors with timing, rounding in calculations, the communication between the release of the pendulum and the start of the timer, not perfectly exact string lengths, other errors in timing such as stopping it early/late, and more that we cannot think of.  we made attempts at reducing the amount and severities of the errors through different means.  for example, in table 4 we had more than one person use a stopwatch to measure the period of time and used the average of these times to have a more accurate time to the real time.  this was done to assure that if one person happened to mess up the time, then it didn’t mess up the results because we had two other times to go off of also.  in the other experiments, we did multiple trials for each of the tests to get a more accurate set of results.  

	during this experiment, we learned what impacted the period of a pendulum.  we had a few constraints though, one of the major ones was time.  since we only have lab for 2 hours per week, we did not have enough time for running more trials for each of the different tests.  another constraint that was cause for error in our data gathering was the lack of accurate measuring equipment.  the measuring tapes that were used were not completely accurate due to imperfections in the tape measurer itself, thus possibly affecting our overall results.  these are only a few of the possible places of error that could have occurred in our experiments.  in conclusion, what we ended up learning overall, is that length affects the period of the pendulum.
