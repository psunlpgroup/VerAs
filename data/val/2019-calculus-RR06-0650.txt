discussion and conclusion

	all of the experiments were run to answer the question: what variables affect the acceleration of the system? when the force applied (more hanging mass) was the independent variable, it had a positive correlation with the acceleration of the system. meaning that when the force of the hanging mass increased, so did the acceleration of the system. the two variables had a strong linear relationship because the graph had an r^2 value of 0.9987, and the error bars were small (refer to graph 1). one group’s data supports our first model because they have a similar slope and y intercept compared to our equation is  $y=3.2171 x + 0.0022$. another group’s data partially supports our data because they have a similar y intercept, but a slightly off slope compared to our equation is  $y = 1.9876 x + 0.0425$.  the correct theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by a single force is acceleration equals force divided mass ($f = a m$). this equation fits our mathematical model because 2.8179kg, the coefficient, is close to 3kg which was the mass of the cart, and the y intercept was extremely close to zero which means it had little to no effect. this resulting in the acceleration having a linear relationship with force just like in the correct equation. the enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by more than one force is $a =\frac{f_{net}}}{m}$. this supports our mathematical model because if more forces were to be applies to the cart, the acceleration output in the would just equal the sum of the forces divided by mass. in the scenario of a heavy string, it would add more force applied (mass * gravity) and therefore increase the acceleration due to the positive relationship. random errors could include misjudging the starting point of the cart for each run due to different viewpoints. this could be reduced by having the same person set it each time and by having a clear mark on the cart where to set it for consistency. another cause of random error was mis-weighing some of the bobs which would affect our numbers for force applied. this error could be reduced by weighing the bobs multiple times in order to get the correct masses for objects weighing very little. the labs had constraints which affected the number of variables we could test that impact acceleration. with limited materials, there could no way to test if the type of string or type of cart had any effect. moreover, we could not test a massive amount of weight due to the possibility of the friction-less device getting damaged in the process.
