does adjusting the hanging force affect the acceleration of the cart, despite total system weight remaining constant, and how does factors like tilt and friction affect these values? to test this, the experiment was designed so that with three different tilt-levels, we measured the total system weight and then separately weighed the weights of the hanging force, so that as we procedurally add on weights. we can then find for certain if the hanging weight force has a statistically significant impact on the acceleration of the cart, as well as elevation based off the measured acceleration using matlab newton’s second law and a constant starting position of 1.1 meters. in this experiment, the hanging force is our independent variable, and our cart acceleration is our dependent variable. 

based on other groups’ data, it is certain that the data supports a positive linear relationship between hanging force and acceleration, but expresses more of a negative power relationship when comparing the mass of the cart to acceleration. for the same scenario, they got $a=2.8543$ for 0 cm height, $a=2.8423 f_a -0.0847$ for 1.12cm height increasse, and $a=2.91 f_a -0.1411$ for 2.62cm height added. in other words, their data supports the same type of relationship, and the same as well for a group who tested friction. they got $a=2.07$ fa -0.0182, 2.089 fa -0.0643, and 2.0008 fa -.03, these results do coincide with ours, and support that these two variables are constants for a reason.

	based on the fact that we know most of our data follows a positive, linear relationship, then we can then take the equation of the line and find that for all of the data. using $y=m x+b$ for most of the data, y is acceleration and the x is a hanging or cart force. r < 1 for all. for solving for one constant since x is c1 (hanging force) and b is c2 (friction), you just procedurally work through experiments, one group focusing on one constant. this experiment was by no mean flawless; however. due to using very old scaled, wear and tear of the weights and other parts could have rubbed off and lowering their true mass from their advertised. other systematic error occurred in the data acquisition, where matlab had a pre-assigned y-error as .001 and for the x-error bar was the first weight used in each experiment. if any random error occurred, it would have happened during the linearization of mat’s lab’s data. reduction of error could be done with newer, less worn, equipment, but the exact extent of its impact is currently unknown. other issue occurred in the form of obstacles when it came to performing the experiment, namely, the limited number of trials and runs due to time restrictions, as well as malfunctioning software eating valuable time.
