discussion and conclusion 



this series of experiments was investigating how length of string, weight of mass, and angle of release affect the period of a pendulum. 

the first experiment investigated the effect of the length of the string on the period of the pendulum by adjusting the length of the string in 30 cm increments from 30 cm - 150 cm and timing the length of the pendulum period with a stopwatch. the angle of release was held constant at 20 degrees and the weight of the pendulum was held constant at 50 grams. figure 1 demonstrates the direct relationship between the length of string and pendulum period because as the length of string increases, the period length also increases. a horizontal line cannot be drawn through the individual data points or their error bars, ensuring that a relationship exists between length and period. this experiment was repeated with a more precise timing instrument, a photogate, in the final trial. this investigated the effect of the length of string on the period of the pendulum by increasing the length of the string in 20 cm increments from 20 cm- 200 cm. the angle of release was held constant at 10 degrees and the weight was 250 grams. figure 2 demonstrates the direct relationship between the length of the string and pendulum period because as the length of the string increases, the period length also increases. a horizontal line cannot be drawn through each data point or their error bars, ensuring this relationship exists. this relationship holds true for angles 10 degrees - 25 degrees and for weights 50 grams - 250 grams because these were the controlled variables in the experiment. however, the relationship may hold true under other constraints. 

the second experiment investigated the effect of the mass of the weight on the pendulum period by adjusting the mass in 40 gram increments from 50 grams - 210 grams and timing the length of the pendulum period with a stopwatch. the angle of release was held constant 20 degrees and the length of the string was held constant at 80 cm. figure 3 shows no relationship between the mass of the weight and the period of the pendulum because a horizontal line can be drawn through all the error bars, indicating that taking error into account, all masses could have equal periods. the relationship holds true under the constraints with which the experiment was run - 80 cm string length and 20 degree angle of release. however, the claim may hold true under a wider array of constraints. 

the third experiment’s initial trial investigated the effect of angle of release on pendulum period by adjusting the angle of release in 5 degree increments from 10 degrees - 30 degrees and timing the period with a stopwatch. the length of the string was held constant at 80 degrees and the weight was held constant at 250 grams. figure 4 shows a possible direct relationship between angle of release and length of period because a horizontal line can only be drawn through the error bars of the first two angles, 10 degrees and 15 degrees, indicating that there may be no relationship. the second trial investigated the effect of angle of release on pendulum period by adjusting the angle of release by 3 degrees from 3 degrees - 15 degrees, a smaller constraint than the previous trial. the final trial also used a more accurate timing system, a photogate. the length of the string was held constant at 80 cm and the mass of the weight was held constant at 250 grams. figure 5 shows that there is no relationship between angle of release and length of period because a horizontal line can be drawn through all the data points and their error bars, indicating that they are all the same point. this claim is only true of angles 15 degrees or less, with a string length of 80 cm and a mass of 250 kg. however, the claim may hold true under a wider array of constraints if tested. 

the theoretical mathematical model for the period of the pendulum is $y=0.995 x$ where y is the time of the period is seconds, and x is the length of the pendulum string in meters. the mathematical model produced in lab is $t=0.9544445 l$ where t refers to the length of the period and l refers to the length of the pendulum string. this mathematical model was based on the data from table 4 and figure 2, because figure 3, figure 4, and figure 5 show no relationship between mass of pendulum or angle of release on pendulum period, respectively. the data from table 4 was used instead of table 2 because a more accurate timing instrument was used in the final trial of this experiment, yielding more accurate data in table 4. the data from table 4 fits into the mathematical model because if the length of the pendulum string in meters is inserted for l, the time, t that results would be the same or extremely close to the value for period recorded in table 4. figure 2 was fit with a power curve using the data from table 4 to yield the mathematical model, further demonstrating the relationship between the reported data and the mathematical model. mass of pendulum and angle of release, the data from tables 5-10, were not factored into the mathematical model because they do not affect the period of a pendulum according to the above analysis. the r2 value for figure 2 is 0.9978. r2 is a measure of how close the data is fitted to the trend line. because the r2 value is very close to 1, that indicates that the data from the figure 2 fit very well into the powerfit curve, indicating its accuracy. further, the mathematical model in lab and the theoretical model are very similar, they differ slightly in the coefficient 1.99 and 2.0855, respectively, and slightly in the exponent, 0.5 and 0.457, respectively. these discrepancies can be accounted for in the error analysis described below. 

random errors include the angle of release being slightly off, the stopwatch timing not being accurate, or the length of the string differing slightly from the recorded value. systematic errors could be due to pre-existing bends in the tape measure. random errors could be reduced by doing multiple trials for each angle of release and averaging the period times together and re-tying the string for multiple trials and averaging the period times together. during the experiment, multiple people timed the trials that involved the stopwatch and the times were averaged together for each period time, reducing random error. systematic error could be reduced by checking for discrepancies in the tape measure, determining the magnitude of the discrepancy in measurement, and then adjusting lengths accordingly. 

lengths over 200 cm couldn’t be tested in the lab so claims can only be generalized to lengths under 200 cm. angles over 15 degrees shouldn’t have been tested so claims can only be generalized to angles 15 degrees and under. masses over 250 grams couldn’t be tested in lab so claims can only be generalized to masses 250 grams or under. additionally, with each independent variable, only one set of control variables were tested, limiting the overall generalizability of the claims made.
