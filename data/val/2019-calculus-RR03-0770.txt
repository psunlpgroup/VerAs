discussion and conclusion:

	in these experiments, the lab groups attempted to answer the research question asking what independent variables affected the dependent variable of pendulum period length. in order to isolate variables, individual experiments were set up for mass, pendulum length, and the angle of release while controlling the other variables. also, every variable was timed for 5 periods and the average was taken to reduce random error within the experiment. other random error could be from trying to use a protractor to judge the angle of release as well as there could be applied force from the hand releasing the pendulum. in experimental design table 2, mass is indicated as the independent variable that would be changed. to hold other variables constant, we held pendulum length at 38.5 cm and the angle of release at 20 degrees. in order to try to find the most precise measurements, we took the time of five periods then divided by five to find the average time. we started with a mass of 50 grams and moved up by 40 grams until we hit 210 grams for our testing points.

	in the experiment mass vs period length, the data collected was graphed in excel to look for trends. standard deviation was calculated using the data in table 4 which was collected at 90 grams, 40 cm pendulum length, and a release angle of 30 degrees. this gave a standard deviation of 0.0158 seconds which gave an equivalency criterion of 0.0316 seconds. the equivalency criterion was used as error bars and when applied to graph 2, it became apparent that mass has no correlation to period length as a horizontal line could be drawn through every equivalency criterion. this is supported by table 2 as well as the theoretical formula for period length as it does not include mass in the calculation. within that equation; however, pendulum length is included in the theoretical equation and that is the next tested variable.

	in the experiment designed to find a correlation between pendulum length and period length, mass and angle of release were both held constant at 90 grams and 20 degrees respectively as seen in experimental design 1. in table 1a, pendulum length started at 18.5cm and went up 5 cm up to 38.5cm and each period length was determined as the average between 5 periods to reduce error. after graphing this data and applying the same equivalency criterion as used for mass, it was seen there was a correlation. in order to confirm this correlation, this data was then recollected using photogates to gather the data seen in table 1b. this data was then graphed on graph 1b and an equivalency criterion of .002 was used as the photogate had a standard deviation of .001. after the units where all switched to be the same in meters and seconds, an equation could be made to find the exact correlation.

	this equation was period lengt$h=2.0082 l^{0.5136}$. this is very similar to the theoretical of $t=\frac{2 \pi l^{0.5}}{\sqrt{g}}$. this is because 2pi/sqrt(g) is equivalent 2.007 so the measured equation is very similar. possible reasons they might differ come down to both limitations in measurement, as well as real-world variables that apply outside a vacuum. some of those limitations include a person releasing the pendulum as they might apply a non-coplanar force causing some momentum to not affect the timed result. also, the angle of release will not be perfect, and some real-world variables include air resistant to the path of flight as well as pushing from the side. these errors could be reduced using a catch release mechanism to make the release perfect in the aspect of angle and avoiding applied force. if the experiment was done this way in a vacuum, the theoretical would most likely be observed. with all this considered, the measured and theoretical model are very similar since that measured equation has an r^2 value of 0.9999.

	the last variable we tested was the angle of release. the mass was held at 90 grams and the pendulum length was 38.5cm. the data collected can be found in table 3 and this data was graphed in graph 3. the angle started at 20 degrees and increased by 10 for each run up to 60 degrees. this data after the equivalency criterion of 0.0318 was applied to the graph showed there was no strong correlation though it did not fit perfectly. this can be explained by the angle of release only affecting the period length once the angle of 30 degrees was achieved. this means our data supported the theoretical model below 30 degrees but then slightly deviated. our measuring system was too inaccurate to guarantee a difference. the model might have been accurate enough if we had used a catch release system to stop the random error of the angle of release. systematic error could have been reduced if we calibrated all of our measurement devices before conducting the experiment.

	constraints within our experiments include time, workforce, and measuring systems. time was limited which made the experiment rushed and no bad measurements were able to be evaluated and potentially thrown out. this also prevented a sufficient amount of peer reviews. the lack of peer reviews was also due to the workforce involved. the workforce had by and large had very little experience in these types of experiments. this meant inconsistent and slow results. the results are also bad as the lack of time declined the ability to calibrate the measuring system which caused a lot of systematic errors.
