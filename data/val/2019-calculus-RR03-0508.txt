discussion and conclusion:

	a. in this lab, we ran multiple experiments to see which factors impacts the period of a pendulum. we tested angle of release of the object, the mass of the object, and length of the rope the object was attached to.

	b. our experiments show that length of the string had the biggest effect on the period of a pendulum, this is because when looking at the slopes of each graph, we can see that the slope of length vs time graph had the biggest slope. this means that it had the most change in the dependent variable (time) for every increase of 1 in the independent variable. for the mass vs time graph, it looks like the mass had an effect on the time of a pendulum, however, when you look at the slope of the graph above (graph 2b) it is -.0011 which is very close to zero, this makes me think that mass does not have an effect on the period of the pendulum. after looking at the graph 2c, i saw that the slope is .0045 which is also close to zero and about 4 times as small as the slope for graph 2a. due to this, i have come to the conclusion that the length of the string is the only factor that effects the period of the pendulum.

c. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is. our equation that we found is  and our r-squared value is .9982 which is very close to 1 for the length of string vs time graph. our data fits with this model, however the theoretical model takes into account the gravitational force.

	d. a random error that was present could be timing error due to initially using lab partners to time the period from start to end using a stopwatch. this could be a random error because it is very possible that either one of them made a mistake at least once. to reduce this, we had one person only to time the period of the pendulum. another error could be that the stopwatches were not calculating the exact right time, this would be a systematic error because it would have happened every time we calculated the period of the pendulum. another random error could be not releasing the object from the exact supposed angle. this is a random error because it will not have happened every time. to reduce every random error, we did more and should do more trials for every lab from now on.

e. we were limited to a set amount of equipment and limited to use specific software. if we were to use more accurate and precise equipment, we would definitely have more accurate data.
