discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to figure out which of the independent variables (mass, angle, and length of string) had an impact on the period of the pendulum. this was accomplished by testing each of the independent variables separately compared to the period of the pendulum.

in the first experiment, mass versus the period was tested. in figure 1, the data shows that the relationship between the mass and the period of the pendulum was non-linear, and also that the error bars overlap. the error bars here are very small which indicates that there is a small standard deviation. if the error bars are this small and the data still overlaps, this proves that the mass does not increase or decrease the period of the pendulum and that there is no relationship. in the second experiment, the angle versus the period of the pendulum was tested. in figure 2, the data shows that the data points form a slightly-downward linear relationship but the error bars overlap. this shows that there is a small standard deviation between the data and that the data overlaps within error. this proves that no relationship between the angle and the period of the pendulum can be concluded. in experiment 3, the length of the string vs. the period of the pendulum was tested. in figure 3, the data shows that the points form a positive correlation. in this case, the error bars do not overlap until the last two data points showing that the period of the pendulum increases with the length of the string but levels off after the length is too long. the error bars are a little bit larger in this experiment showing that the data has a larger standard deviation and the relationship is there even within error. 

after observation of these trials, it was concluded that the period of the pendulum was only affected by the length of the string. to make sure that this was indeed true and to rule out any possible error, the experiment was re-tested. the data collected in figure 4, shows that the relationship was indeed directly proportional. the error bars in this case do not overlap again until the last few points. the graph was not completely linear though, as the last few points leveled off. the conclusion was made that the relationship was not linear, however, it was a power relationship $y=x^2$.

	the theoretical model of this lab was $y=0.3x^{0.5}$. we were able to make a full model of this because the experimental best fit line in figure 4 was $y=0.2916x^{0.4328}$. in figure 4, the best fit line fits the data points almost perfectly with an r^2 value of .99. in figure 1, the theoretical model of the pendulum would not fit because the data is not a power function. the data here is non-linear and a best fit line would not be a power function. this proves that the mass does not have an impact on the period of the pendulum. in figure 2, the data shows that the best fit line here would be a downward-linear line but that it would not fit perfectly. the data overlaps with the error bars showing that a relationship is not present. this does not fit the theoretical power model. this shows the angle does not have an impact on the period of the pendulum. in figure 3, the best fit line here would be a power which would fit the theoretical model. this shows that the length of the string does have an impact on the period of the pendulum. 

some errors that were present in this lab could have been random error. the timing of the stopwatches was not precise and not only one person was using the stopwatch for each trial. this could have caused some of our timing to be off from the time it actually was. this could be possibly fixed by doing more trials and keeping the person using the stopwatch consistent. this was fixed by taking another trial when doing the length vs. period experiment. another error that could have occurred was systematic error. the balance that we used to measure the mass of the blocks we were using could have been off a little bit because it was not calibrated correctly when we used it. it also does have its own range of error. in the future, this could be prevented by calibrating the balance correctly. a constraint that could have limited the generalizability in this experiment could have been that the length of the string was only 200cm and the results could possibly vary with a longer length of string.
