conclusion:
The purpose of labs 5 and 6 were to determine the affect of force and mass on acceleration. Lab five included two experiments, one to determine the affect of hanging mass on acceleration and the other to determine the affect of cart mass on acceleration. These experiments were used to develop a mathematical model. The mathematical model developed for the effect of hanging mass on acceleration was $A=0.0941 F^{1.0781}$. This was determined by plotting our data obtained from testing hanging masses of 5,10,15,20, 25, and 30 grams while keeping the mass of the system the same. The second experiment tested the effect of cart mass on acceleration. My group did not have enough time to get to this part of the experiment so we do not have a mathematical equation for this portion. It was observed from other groups that if cart mass was increased then acceleration decrease. This caused the graph to show a negative correlation. The object of lab six was to determine the affect of a physical lab setting on one of the variables from lab 5. Our group used the effect of friction on the changing hanging mass which was conducted in experiment 5. There were three strengths of friction each tested on a changing hanging mass of 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 grams. The results of each test were graph. The R-values obtained from these tests were very poor indicating extreme error. 
b) The three experiments lead to the resulting data by testing different effects on acceleration. It is known that Newtons second law of motion is the acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. This was seen with the experiments conducted and with the results of the mathematical equations. From the mathematical equation, it was determined that y represents acceleration and x was the changing factor. X representing hanging mass, cart mass, and friction. The data found is discussed below in question c. 
The data seen from groups 3 and 5 show very good values. The R-values seen are close to one indicating a good outcome. Comparing this with our data from Figure 3, shows that our results were not as good. Our R-value obtained from testing the effect of no friction on changing hanging mass was 0.5726. This does not indicate very good results. Our mathematical equation was determined to be $a= 0.816 F+ 2.3$. This is compared to data from group 5 of $a=0.0028 F-0.0049$. Our mathematical results from the changing hanging mass and half friction was $a= 1.8336 F+ 0.7976$. Group 5 mathematical data was $a=0.0018 F-0.0109$. Our mathematical equation for full friction with changing hanging mass was $a=-0.062 F +7.754$. Comparing this with test three of group 5 was $a=0.0037 F-0.0082$. Group 5 had better R-values than the results of our graphs indicating they had better results. 
There were a lot of errors that occurred in this experiment, especially with lab 6. It can be seen that our R-values for lab 6 are not very close to one. Some of errors that could have occurred were not using the friction properly. It was difficult to get the popsicle stick to stay on the cart during the full duration of testing. Another error that could have occurred was with the hanging mass. There was a mix up with bobbers and this could have resulted in a change in weight. Another error that could have occurred was using the DataStudio system. We could have read the wrong values off of the system resulting in graphing the wrong data. Overall, there was a misunderstanding of the experiment and given another go we could have gotten better results. In the future having a better understanding of the lab, better source of friction, and better knowledge of the DataStudio would improve our results. 
e) Some constraints that limit the generalizability of the results was the testing site. Since multiple groups used the AirTrack it is hard to know if the testing site was the exact same between the two experiments. Another constraint is gravity. Gravity is another factor acting on the cart, not just friction. This can sway determining the true effect of the friction used on the cart during the experiment. 
f) Newtons second law is the acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. This holds true with the data collected from our experiments. It was found that if mass of the cart was increased then acceleration decreased. It was also found that if hanging mass going in the same direction as the cart was increased then acceleration was increased. Physical factors that influenced acceleration were friction. If friction was increased, then acceleration decreased. This coincides with Newtons second law.
