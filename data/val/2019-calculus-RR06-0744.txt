discussion and conclusion

	the purpose of the lab was to investigate the process of developing models based on real system data in order to mathematically represent the behavior.  the values found in the models were studied as well to understand their connection with the components of the lab.

	the three mathematical models were determined using the graphs created from the experimental data.  an equation representative of the data graphed on figure 1 was found using the excel trendline function.  this acceleration versus applied force model shows that the lab dv increases while the iv increases and the inverse.  this is both a causal relationship and a positive correlation between the variables.  the model’s constant 2.7875 has a unit of 1/kg and shows the ratio between applied force and acceleration.  the model’s constant -0.0216 has a unit of m/s^2 and just shows the slight offset of acceleration found while determining the mathematical model.  the acceleration versus mass models were determined using the excel trendline function with the data graphed on figure 2 and figure 3.  these acceleration versus mass models showed that the dv decreased while the iv increased.  the constants -17.664 and -14.1 have a unit of (m/x^2)/kg and show the ratio between mass and the resulting acceleration.  their constants 5.9847 and 4.7934 have a unit of m/s^2 and represent the offset of acceleration that occurs with the determined mathematical model.

the group was unable to attain the findings of two other groups during the lab period, and thus could not corroborate our results with others.

the errors that may have been present in the experiments are both random and systematic in nature.  while using the nearly frictionless air track in lab 05, the cart experienced greater amounts of friction as more mass was attached to the cart.   this would have systematically decreased the values of acceleration that were found in lab 05.  air resistance and friction present in the pulley would similarly decrease the acceleration in both lab 05 and lab 06.  in order to reduce the effects of these systematic errors, the experiment could be repeated in a vacuum with as little acting gravity as necessary to conduct the experiment.  the magnet strips a potential source of random error would be in the starting position of the track at the beginning of each trial.  thought the initial position was intended to be 300 mm, it is possible that the cart wasn’t perfectly aligned each time.  this would randomly increase and decrease the acceleration.  we did our best to ensure that the cart was as closely aligned to 300 mm as possible, but to minimize error, a more precise measuring device could be used.
