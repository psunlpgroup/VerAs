discussion & conclusion



during this lab, we were trying to determine whether or not the following three factors (mass, string length, release angle) would impact the period of pendulum oscillations. only two out of the three factors that were tested actually affected the period average, based off our graphs. those two factors would be the string length and the release angle. for the average period vs. mass graph, there is no linear measurements, therefore, there is no consistent slope, which is why mass is not a factor that affects the average period. since the error bars overlap, that means that there is no certainty that the mass affects the period of the pendulum. for the average period vs. string length graph, there is a positive, linear slope. therefore, as the string length increased, the period of the pendulum also increased. since the error bars don’t overlap, that means that there is certainty that the string length affects the period of the pendulum. for the average period vs. release angle graph, there is a linear, negative slope. therefore, as the release angle increases, the period of the pendulum decreased. since the error bars don’t overlap, that means that there is certainty that the release angle affects the period of the pendulum.

	there were definitely errors that could have occurred throughout this lab, both random and systematic. some possible random errors that could have occurred include the angle of release not being exact by accidentally moving, the length of the string being moved after measuring, someone stopping the timer at the incorrect point, etc. any of those errors could either increase or decrease the average period time, depending on how the angle is changed, how the string length is changed, or when the person stops the timer. these errors could be reduced by adding more awareness while doing the procedure, as well as performing more trials in order to get a more accurate average value. some possible systematic errors that could have occurred during this lab include the triple balance beam not being balanced properly, the stopwatch delaying time, the tape measure being stretched out, the protractors lines being faded away, etc. those errors could also have increased or decreased the average period time. these errors could be reduced by calibrating the triple beam balance before each use, as well as using known values of items to test the equipments accuracy before performing the lab. 

a major constraint of this experiment can include time because using stopwatches that are relies on the human eye to be able to determine the exact start and stop point of the pendulum can be extremely inaccurate. due to the inaccuracy, the results become generalized.
