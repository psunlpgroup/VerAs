discussion and conclusion

    the purpose of lab 5 was to develop mathematical models that explains the behavior of a real system. the purpose of lab 6 was to create a general understanding for each variable and numerical value that was included in the model.the three experiments my lab partners and i conducted helped us find the relationship between both masses and their accelerations and this relationship we tested lead us to finding the equation for both of these variables. i think that the graphs show the same results but with one (m1)  with a constantly decreasing acceleration with more weight and the other (m2) constantly decreasing as the mass goes up. we compared our results to group 5 and found our equations to be somewhat similar. there are a number of systematic errors that could have affected our results. an example of this is if we used the wrong weight and associate it with an acceleration. this can vastly effect our results depending on how far we are off. another example of a systematic error would be if we mixed up our numbers and wrote the wrong equations.there are also random errors that could also have affected our results. an example of this is if we don't use the same exact distance every time when measuring the acceleration. this can make the graph that we create not be accurate. being vigilant and double checking the lab set up can help reduce these errors. errors in the air track can be a constraint that can limit the generalizability of the results. the two experimental models are both consistent with newton's law.
