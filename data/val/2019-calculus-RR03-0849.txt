discussion and conclusion

the research question being investigated was “what variables have an impact on the period of a pendulum for small swings?”

in our experiments we tested whether the length of string, angle of release, or mass of the bob affect the period of a pendulum. each of the experiments isolated one of these factors in order to see how it would affect the pendulum’s period. we determined that for small swings the only characteristic that has an impact on the period is the length of the string. in graph 1 we see the mass does not have any significant affect on the period. the y-values are all very close together and there does not seem to be any correlation between the period and the mass of the pendulum. in graph 2 we see that for small swings (less than 20 degrees) there is no correlation between the angle of release and the period. although angles do have an impact when greater than 20 degrees, for the purposes of this lab we only look at angles 20 degrees or less. in graph 3 we see a positive correlation between the length of the string and the period. as the length of the string increases, the period also increases and follows a trend that is similar to a power curve.

the theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum is $t=2 \pi$ * square root(l/g). in graph 1 for mass of bob vs. period we see that there is no correlation between the two. this is reflected within the theoretical equation because there is no value for a pendulums mass that goes into the formula. this tells us that mass theoretically has no impact on the period of a pendulum. for graph 2 of the angle of release vs. period we see that angles less than 20 degrees has very little impact on the period. this is reflected in the equation as there is no variable where the angle of release could be plugged in. for graph 3 we see that as the length of string increases the period also increases. this is supported by the theoretical equation because we see that the length (designated as variable “l”) is proportional to the period.

some systematic errors that were present include the tape measure having incorrect markings and not giving an accurate measurement, the masses are not the true weight they say they are (i.e. the mass is not actually 50 grams), and the motion sensor not being calibrated properly. we could reduce these systematic errors by checking our measurements with other equipment and determining by how much our values are off and accounting for this in our data.

some random errors include the timer does not press the stopwatch at the exact moment the 5th period is completed, the angle measured with the protractor was not exact every time, the length of the string being different each time due to human error in measuring, and the lab stand that the pendulum was on shifted as the pendulum moved. we could reduce these random errors by increasing the amount of trials to minimize the effect of the timer not pressing the stopwatch at the exact moment. we could also take multiple measurements of the angle and the string before proceeding with the experiment. finally, we could make sure that the lab stand is secured tightly to the table before conducting the experiment.

some constraints that may limit the generalizability of our results include the fact that we did not test the period with a mass greater than 300 grams so for masses over 300 grams we cannot apply our data. another constraint would be that we did not test whether the material the string is made of affects the period. a final constraint would be that we did not test how the period would be affected at different elevations so we cannot apply our data to a pendulum scenario at an extraordinarily high altitude.
