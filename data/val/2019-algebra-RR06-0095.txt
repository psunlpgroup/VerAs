conclusion:
In Lab 5 our group was tasked with finding the effects of a change in mass on the acceleration of a system; one instance where the hanging mass increases and one where the mass of the cart increases. In this case the experiment design called for a cart on a strait track propelled by air pressure towards one side. On that side is a frictionless pulley, connecting with a string, the cart to a hanging mass. With a multitude of different masses given, we were then given free rein to then design an experiment in Lab 6 to use the tools available to investigate how tilt effects the acceleration of the cart using the exact same experimental model as in Lab 5 factoring in the tilt of the track. Below is a picture of the experiment design. 
We hypothesized in lab 5 that the acceleration of the cart will increase as does the hanging mass from the pulley as this mass is frictionless unlike that later added to the cart in experiment 2 on lab 5. This hypothesis is also consistent with Newton’s 2nd law. We designed the experiment to test the adding of a 5kg weight to the hanging mass and ran the experiment for each instance of a different mass. We used lab equipment in this design to accurately obtain the speed at which the cart is traveling as it went down the track, calculated the acceleration, ang graphed it on an acceleration vs hanging mass graph. It should be noted that we used Newtons for the hanging mass because we need to calculate the force it adds to the system as it pertains to the work done in later experiments and the namesake of the lab. 


For the second experiment, we hypothesized that adding mass to the cart will have the same but not as pronounced affect as changing the hanging mass in experiment 1 due to the friction caused by the increase in mass on the cart. We tested the acceleration in this instance with a hanging mass that did not change and therefore didn’t affect the experiment, and the addition of mass in 50kg intervals on the cart and converted the total mass in each instance to newtons to show the forces at play to make a mathematical model from our result. This result showed an exponential trendline which displayed very clearly that the acceleration decreased along with the mass, proving out initial hypothesis wrong. Our group simply did not conceive how big of an impact friction would have in the experiment. All data pertaining to experiment 2 in lab 5 is shown below. The only discernable error that is possible with a margin of error this tiny is an incorrect weighing of the masses of the weights added to the system.  This reigns true for both experiments 


This recognition of the friction at play here served as a transition to the next lab (Lab 06) in which we tested whether changing the tilt in the direction of travel of the cart would increase the acceleration as mass is added to the bobber. We did this because we designed the experiment if this would be the only other factor to affect acceleration in this instance which was the original purpose of lab 6; to investigate a factor and design an experiment around it. In this experiment, our group opted to use the same mass values from experiment 1 in lab5, testing it with 3 separate tilts as shown below, then graphing it ass mass of the bobber vs acceleration in each instance. Mass on the cart remained a constant thorough the experiment. Below is all the raw data associated with the 3 experiments from lab 06. I am not differentiating them and addressing them separately because they are so like one another minus that one factor. 
As you can see, the acceleration DOES increase with the tilt, it is just not too discernable from the data available because the change in the functions of the graphs themselves is so small. Coupled with the small margin of error, we concluded that our findings were accurate. Though if we hadn’t kept the mass we did on the cart, it might have lessened the friction to the point where the change in acceleration with the tilt could have been more easily seen on the graphs themselves. This along with incorrect measuring of the weights provided could be a source for error. 

To conclude, all our findings from both parts of the force and motion labs aligns exactly with newton’s second law and verifies its validity. In every case the acceleration of the system in both labs increased with a frictionless mass and tilt, and subsequently decreased when the mass added to the friction, and we are certain that our mathematical model for each case was correct otherwise the experiment would have been inconclusive. All error margins likely came from an incorrect mass measurement of some kind at some point by a very small number (0.001kg for example.)
