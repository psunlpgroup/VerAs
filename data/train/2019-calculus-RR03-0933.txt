conclusion:


	in order to answer the research question of ‘what impacts the period of a pendulum?’, we ran 3 experiments which tested how certain variables affected the pendulums period. you can see in tables 1, 2, and 3 the plans for each experiment. we predicted that only the length of the pendulum would affect the period. the evidence supporting this can be seen in table 1a and figure 1. meanwhile, the angle and mass of the pendulum did not seem to have any strong correlation with its period as seen in table 2a and table 3a. the theoretical mathematical model we came up with was $y=0.0129 x + 0.864$ with x being the length of the pendulum in centimeters and y being the length of the period in seconds. you can see this line fit our data in figure 1. the only variable included in our model was the length considering the model had an r-squared value of .9971, while the other data we collect seemed to have little correlation. there were many possible sources of error in our experiment, both random and systematic. one being the use of stopwatches to collect the period length, causing times to not be exact, giving us random error. another source of error could be the method used to release the pendulum at a certain angle. we simply used a protractor and our best judgement. to prevent the timing error, we used a photogate to get a more accurate timing. as for the error in the angle, we could have a specific height and distance to drop it from giving a more reliable measurement. one constraint of the experiment was the length of the pendulum we could test. the table only allowed for around a meter of string to be tested.
