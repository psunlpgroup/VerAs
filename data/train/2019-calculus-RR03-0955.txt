conclusion:
After looking at the results of the first lab, our conclusion was that initial angle and the length affect the period of the pendulum. The only factor that did not affect the period of the pendulum based off of our results was the mass. We noticed that there was some random errors that occurred within this, this is likely due to the fact that the angle measurement was not recorded as well as it could. The pendulum was released after the protractor was removed which could have skewed the results. The timing method also could have been better, since using a human operated timer allows for even more error. There also was a few number of trials that were performed, and more trials were performed. The biggest constraint was the amount of human performance that had to go into this experiment. There were other smaller constraints such as air resistance, type of string, pendulum used, time to perform lab, etc.
After calculating these errors, the same conclusion can be made from the first lab. The errors give us the same results and the same relationships for the given intervals.


Since the TA stated that initial angle does not actually affect the period of the pendulum, the only independent variable tested for this lab was length of the pendulum.
This showed a very similar mathematical model to that of the equation. The coefficient and the exponent are very similar when the equation is converted to inches from meters. This curve is also very accurate, with the r^2 value being extremely close to 1.
The final conclusion was that the factor that affects the period of the pendulum is length. Based off the equation, gravity also affects the period, but the gravity is the same everywhere on earth, so it cannot be tested. Initial angle and mass do not affect the period of the pendulum.
