conclusion:
How does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? As it turns out, our hypothesis was correct from table 01 because $a=\frac{F}{m}$ the acceleration (uncertainty givin in data 1) (DV) is impacted by the hanging mass (uncertainty of +/- 0.05g) (IV) in a linear relationship that is positive. Looking at the experimental equation from graph 1, you can see that there is a y-intercept indicating other forces acting to the cart other than the hanging mass (IV). The y-intercept could have been caused by a non-horizontal track or uneven air flow from the track. There are a few places where random errors can occur in this experiment. One is that there could have been a knot in our string leading to an incorrect acceleration. This could be avoided by using a new string or triple check that there are no knots. Another is that when releasing the cart, we could have accidentally given an extra force leading to an incorrect acceleration. This could be fixed by having robotic arms hold and release the cart. Systematic errors that could have happened during the experiment are not having a horizontal track and inaccurate measuring techniques/instrumentation. Our experimental equation is $y=0.0489 x - 0.042$ while the theoretical model is $a =\frac{f}{m}$ but there is even a better enhanced equation that represents all forces acting on the cart, and it is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. The theoretical model does support the experimental because it does not include the other forces acting on it like friction but the slope in the inverse of the mass. The theoretical does not support the enhanced model because it includes all of the forces present neglecting friction and perfect experimental setup. Not having frictionless track was a large constraint, this was a factor into the y intercept on our experimental equation. I agree with group half beard’s (figure 3) summation equation. It includes most of the forces acting on the system. I disagree with group KAR’s (figure 2) statement about having a known friction value. The y intercept is also composed of uneven air flow and angle of the track. The theoretical equation ($a=\frac{f}{m}$) can estimate the slope of the experimental ($y=m x+b$) but does not include other forces like friction and the angle of the track. The enhanced equation does include all forces acting on the system if there is no friction. If the string was heavy, then it would cause friction between the pully and add mass to the system. The extra mass will cause the acceleration to increase while the extra friction will slightly decrease it, but the mass will influence the acceleration more.
