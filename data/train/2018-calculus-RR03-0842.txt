conclusion:
Throughout the course of these three experiments we found that the length impacts the period of a pendulum with a small swing. Our first experiment tested three factors the group came up with that might affect the period of a pendulum; mass, angle of release and length of the string. As you can see from the graphs in the first experiment the only on that has a correlation is the length of the string vs. period. In the other graphs the error bars overlap indicating that the values may have remained the same if uncertainty was removed. In experiment 2 we discovered what some of the uncertainties or errors that could have occurred were. We found that there could be some systematic error with the way we were measuring or the delay in the time. These errors decrease our accuracy but did not affect our precision. On the other hand, random error can affect the accuracy and precision of the data. With a better understanding of these errors we were able to clarify standard deviation allowing us to make error bars for the graph and analyze them to determine if the correlation is genuine. In the final experiment we were able to eliminate some error by using a photogate. This recorded values with higher accuracy as shown in Data Table 3 and Graph 4. With this data closer to the true value we were able to compare the theoretical mathematic model to the model we created with values from testing. Our mathematical model came out to $T=1.0195362 x$ which is very close to the theoretically of               $T=0$ Graph 4 displays this equation along with the R2 value which indicates how well the equation fits the line. 
	Errors are present in every experiment and in this one we had both random and systematic errors. The systematic error of the string stretching as more weight was added gave the illusion that the increased mass was decreasing the period. Also, there was random error in reading the measurements on the tape measure and protractor that cannot be adjusted for in the data. To reduce this error, we can take multiple measurements and average the values to come closer to the true value. 
	The time constraint of this experiment keeps us from collecting more data point that could possibly get us closer to the true model for period of a pendulum. The devices used to measure angle length and time could also increase the accuracy of the period and allow use to get closer to the true value.
