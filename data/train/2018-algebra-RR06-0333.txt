conclusion

the research question that was being tested in this experiment was to see how the acceleration of a system changes when the mass of the system is changed. the research question was approached by seeing how the acceleration of system changed (dv) when the mass that was hanging off of the system changed (iv). our control variable in this experiment was the mass of the system which was 178.8 g which was comprised of all the bobbers that needed to be used along with the cart. the hypothesis was, the greater the force the faster the acceleration. the force (n) from the hanging mass would cause the acceleration (m/s^2) to increase in a linear manner. the data that we collected that our hypothesis was supported because the acceleration did behave in a linear manner and gave us the equation $y=5.0147 x - 0.031$ from graph 2. this shows that there is a positive linear relationship between the hanging mass and the acceleration. to figure out the acceleration of the system, you need to plug in the value for applied force (n) in the “x” value of the equation. the applied force (n) can be calculated by taking hangingmass*9.8m/s^2)(1000). this showed that the higher the value for the hanging mass, the greater the applied force value is thus causing a greater acceleration of the system.

	group archer had the same hypothesis as our group and their findings through their experiment along with the experimental equation that they came up with proves this. they had a slightly smaller value for their equation than ours. this could have been caused by error on our end. looking at their mathematical model and comparing it to ours shows that they are both showing a positive linear relationship which proves for both groups that the hanging mass impacted the acceleration of the system. group sato also had the same hypothesis as our group and group archer that the hanging mass will affect the acceleration of the system. they represented their mass of system in kg so their experimental equation values were slightly greater than ours. since they were consistent with the units throughout the experiment, they received the same results as our group and group archer which shows a positive linear relationship on the graphs. comparing all 3 groups results, you can see that the results were consistent throughout and we all were able to get similar data which we used to proves each other’s results. 

the mathematical model found in this experiment was $y=c1 x+c2$. this equation relates to the theoretical equation, $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ when c2 is 0. the force of the theoretical equation was found to be (hangingmass*9.8m/s^2)(1000). the experimental acceleration value differed from the theoretical acceleration value by 0.031m/s^2 when only one force is accounted for. other than the force of the hanging mass, there was the force of friction. this shows up in the theoretical equation $y=\frac{f_{applied}+f_{friction}}{m_{sys}}$. our experimental equation was $y=5.0147 x - 0.031$. c1 is 1/msys which is 1/.1788kg is 5.592. our experimental c1 value was 0.5773 times smaller than our theoretical c1. force of friction can be found based on our c2 value. $f_{ext}=c2 m_{sys}$ so $f_{ext}= -0.00568$ which mean that this force was acting opposite to the system.

there was room for error in this lab. possible random errors could have been that the mass of the bobbers and the whole system could have been measured inaccurately due to human error which could not have been noticed, which would cause us the use the wrong mass the whole time leading to inaccurate data. this could have been reduced by weighing each mass individually and then adding all the masses together to get a more accurate final mass of the system. a systematic error could have been that the data studio may not have been calibrated properly leading to inaccurate readings which we would then use to move forward with the experiment. this error could have been reduced by making sure that data studio was working properly before the experiment was started.

all in all, the experiment was conducted without many issues. the major issue was time constraints. if we have unlimited time then every precaution could have been taken such as making sure that the equipment was properly calibrated and the masses of the system were properly weighed. also if there was access to better equipment to conduct the experiment, the sources of error would have decreased significantly because the bobbers were very unreliably and they could have been chipped which would lower the real mass and if we had access to a more solid object, a better experiment could have been conducted.
