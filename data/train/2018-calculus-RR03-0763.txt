discussion and conclusion:

the research question that was investigated during these labs was, “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?”. when looking back on all the data that was collected, the length, mass, angle all impacted the period after a small swing. when looking at figure 1-3, you can see how each independent variable change the period after those 5 trials. in lab 03, the theoretical mathematical model was used to help with graphing the data in figure 4. the equation was $t=\frac{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt[4]{g}}$ * length^0.5. when using the equation, it did not fit well with our graph when figuring out if it would or not. but the equation helps us found the best fitting line for our graph which was a power line and found that mass did not really affect the period. in figure 3, mass vs period, the period fluctuated instead of increasing as the mass increased. looking at this data, there had be errors that occurred, there are random and systematic errors in these labs. for figure 3, that would be a random error because the period was fluctuated. we also had some systematic errors, in lab 01, we measured the length in inches instead of cm, the tip of the string was measured wrong. when doing these labs, to reduce the errors in them is to always check what measurement to be using and what unit should they be measured in. have someone to be quick the timer to record the period correctly and not have weird data enter and to check how to measure the string with the ta or instructor. some constraints in lab was only having to do five trials instead of a couple to get a better recording on the data and graph, having a set limit on how the length of the string can be, the angle can only be small to get a better recording. the mass on string could be smaller but the limit was only 50 grams. when doing these experiments, take your time on them and make sure to double check all the equipment so there won’t be no errors or decrease the amount of error in the experiments.
