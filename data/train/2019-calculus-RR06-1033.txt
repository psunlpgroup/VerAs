Conclusion:
	The point of lab 5 was to create mathematical models for acceleration depending on the force that was applied to the system. In lab 6 the objective was to understand what each variable did to the acceleration of the car. 
The experiments in both of the labs led to a linear equation because it had the highest R^2 value compared to the rest of the equations. Another reason it was a linear graph was because in the general form of newtons second law $F=m a$ to find the acceleration you would just divide the mass to get $\frac{f}{m}=a$. 
Some systematic errors that could have happened was there was a little bit of friction because there was not enough air coming out of the pump. The reason this might be an error is because when we were testing the seal to the pump fell out. Other systematic errors could be there was friction between the pulley and the string. Random errors that could have occurred were not distributing the weight evenly. Which would cause the friction if the car were to touch the medal track.
