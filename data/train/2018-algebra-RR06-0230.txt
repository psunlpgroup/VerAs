discussion and conclusion

	the purpose of labs 5 & 6 were to understand how the acceleration of a system changes  when the applied force changes. so, in order to test this, we conducted nine trials, the first with no hanging mass and the last with the maximum hanging mass. we used eight bobbers to apply force to the system. so, our first trial had all eight bobbers attached to the cart and the last trial had all eight bobbers attached to the end of the string to apply force on the cart. by completing these nine trials, we had enough data to create a linear fit on the graph. the equation for this graph ($y=4.856 x - 0.019$ represents the mathematical relationship between acceleration and applied force according to our experimental data. we then calculated the theoretical model, represented by the equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. we got $y = 5.27 x$. the enhanced theoretical model is represented by the equation  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ we got $y = 5.27 x - 0.021$. our experimental model and theoretical model were very close. they both support our initial prediction of a positive linear relationship and confirm our hypothesis that force applied affects acceleration. 

 	our findings along with the findings of two other groups are shown below. 


	all of these results support my group’s predictions and claims. each group shows force applied and acceleration having a positive, linear relationship with a coefficient somewhere around 5.

	the experimental model (  $y=4.8456 x - 0.019$) differs from the theoretical model ($y=5.27 x$) due to a lack of experimental data. the more data we would have collected, the closer the experimental model would have gotten to the theoretical. the sum of forces from factors other than hanging mass, such as friction, air resistance, etc., can be calculated using the uncertainty value given by the line of best fit of the experimental data. for our experiment this uncertainty was calculated to be -0.019. to find the sum of other forces, all we had to do was divide this value by the coefficient (4.8456). as show on our whiteboard, this came out to be 0.0039 newtons. as previously stated, the theoretical model can be calculated by dividing 1 by the mass of the system. adding a mass for the string would increase the total mass of the system, therefore decreasing the coefficient in the theoretical model and decreasing the uniform acceleration of the cart. 

since this experiment relied heavily on computer measurement, there were not very many opportunities for human error. with that being said, some errors could have occurred in the measuring of the mass using the triple beam balance. these errors would most likely be systematic and due to a lack of calibration of the balance. this could have been avoided by measuring an object of known mass with the balance and recording any differences in the known weight and the measured weight. some random error could have been introduced to the experiment by inconsistent release of the cart. the person releasing the cart could have accidentally applied unwanted force to the cart upon releasing it. more careful releasing methods could have prevented this from happening in future experiments.

one major constraint of this experiment was time. we did not have enough time to collect the data required to get a more accurate experimental model. we were also constrained by more physical things like the distance of the air track and the weight we could hang from the string. these two constraints make the experimental data very specific. we only used a small range of hanging masses with a controlled and specific distance of measurement.
