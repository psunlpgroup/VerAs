	the purpose of this experiment was to portray via graphs and tables, what can have an effect on the length of time it takes a pendulum to complete one full period. this was done by going through trials for the affect that the angle of release, mass on the pendulum, and the length of the string all have on the time it takes to complete one period. graph and table a show the relationship that the angle has with the length of a period and the results showed a flat slope very close to zero, evidently showing no relationship between the two. the same process was done for the data collected in graph and table b, except the mass of the pendulum was changed this time. the slope of the line also came out to be near zero which supports the claim that mass has no effect on the time it takes to complete one period. graph and table c on the other hand did show a relationship between the length of the string on the pendulum and the time it took to complete a period. initially, it was thought that the relationship shown in the graph was positive and linear, but later on was concluded that the data plotted had a curve slight curve to it, indicating the model for a pendulum isn’t linear    $y=b + m x$     the model is actually       $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$        in this model, l represents the length of the string and g represents the force of gravity. since measurements we made during the experiment were done in centimeters, the gravity constant of 9.8 m/s^2 can be converted to 980 cm/s^2. with the value of pi (3.14) taken in account, the equation can be rearranged to $y=0.27$.5 where y indicates the period of the pendulum. the line of best fit found in graph c was found to have the equation    $y=0.28 x^{0.437}$       which is very close to the one calculated using the model found for a pendulum. 

	in this experiment, both systematic errors and random errors were found to have an impact on the collection of data for the period of the pendulum. a systematic error found almost immediately was the method used to time the period in table a and b, where a stopwatch was used by hand to measure such a small length of time which had a delay between the person dropping the pendulum giving the go and the person starting and stopping the time on the stopwatch, this delay consistently resulted in longer period times calculated where the error was having two people measure a period rather than one person doing it alone. a random error can also be related back to the stop watch because within a few seconds, the person with the stop watch had to eye when the period was done after every trial which could have left the data either above or below the true time of a complete period. the final error noticed was also a random error where the pendulum was allowed to swing freely and wasn’t supported in order to make sure it would swing at angles more to the right or left of the center, therefor making the period possibly longer or shorter than it actually is. the errors related to the stopwatch were overcome using a device called a photogate which precisely timed the length of each period consistently leaving out human reaction as a possibility for altering the results. the stability of the pendulum could also be fixed if needed in another lab by creating supports that help keep the pendulum centered. 

	although the results in this experiment were relatively conclusive, it is hard to generalize the results for the real world because not enough trials were done to have graphs that have more plotted points than done in this experiment which would result in more accurate lines of best fit and more accurate mathematical models as well.
