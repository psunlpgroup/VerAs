conclusion:
what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? our experiments related to the question because we adjusted the length of the string to see how it affected the time with all other variables being constant. there fore we knew that we were only testing the length of the string as a variable. after testing we discovered that the longer the string of a pendulum becomes the longer it will take for that pendulum to complete one cycle. our theoretical math mathematical models show this in our power curved graph above. as shown above the slope of the line is up correlating to increase length of sting with an increase of time. we also tested things like the weight of the pendulum and the angle at which a pendulum was dropped but we found that the standard deviation of the graphs intersected to much as shown in the graphs below. some of the errors that were present in our first 3 tests of the length of string, angle, and weight was a systematic error because we had human timers which werenâ€™t always stopping at the right time. although in our second round of testing for just length of string we used an electronic timer to take away that error. some constraints we had were the amount of weight to add to the pendulum. if there was a pendulum with .1g and 1million g would there be a difference? so, within the constraints that we had we found that weight does not affect the period of one cycle.
