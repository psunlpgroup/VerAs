conclusion 

in this lab we set out to find the effect of mass, string length and start angle of pendulum to its period time. in the first test we tested release angle and clamed that the period would not change. in doing our experiment we found that the angle did have an effect based on the data we received. we determined that this was a human error because the stopwatch that was used was very difficult to be accurate, so we determined our data was not completely accurate. when testing the mass, we found that as you changed the mass the periods stayed the same having no correlation between the two. after testing the string length, it was clear that the relationship between string length and period were present. we concluded that the mass and start angle didnâ€™t have a relationship while the string length did. errors of the experiment were human reaction with the stopwatch and the stopwatch being fast or slow as well as the measurements possibly not being precise.
