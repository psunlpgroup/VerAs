discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of this lab was to determine the relationship between applied force and acceleration and, in turn, determine a mathematical model that included both aforementioned terms. the research question was as follows is   how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? it was determined that the relationship between applied force and acceleration is a direct linear relationship. this was in agreement with our group’s hypothesis and prediction. the mathematical model determined through the use of data collected in group 3 experimental table and plotted in group 3 experimental graph was $y=5.5209 x - 0.0511$. the following was concluded is  “y” equaled acceleration (m/s2), “m” equaled 1/mass (kg), “x” equaled applied force (n), and the “b” (aka y-intercept) equaled friction. therefore, the resulting excel equation can be written as $a=\frac{f}{m} + f_{friction}$ . as shown in group 3 experimental graph, increasing the applied force (n) caused a direct increase in acceleration (m/s2). this is also true for the mathematical model determined. the uncertainty values were calculated to be less than 0.001 m/s2, so the given datastudio scaled uncertainty value of 0.001 m/s2 was used.

	both group 1’s and group 2’s findings were used in the determination and confirmation of the mathematical model claim. group 1’s and group 2’s data and results agreed with the same general hypothesis that applied force (n) has a direct relationship with acceleration (m/s2). group 1 and group 2 also had similar data values and resulting theoretical models and equation set-ups as group 3. in all groups’ data tables and graphs, a generalized trend could be seen is   as applied force (n) on the cart increased, acceleration (m/s2) of the cart also increased.

	all theoretical models determined by each group (1, 2, and 3) were all identical is 

	$a=\frac{f}{m} + f_{friction}$. group 2 and group 3 had similar numerical values present in the experimental values determined. group 1’s numerical values differed greatly, which may be the result of the improper calculation of (1/mass). all numerical y-intercept (friction) values varied slightly, which may be the result of varying degrees of friction present between the different carts and tracks. other forces, such as the force due to friction and/or air resistance, may have been present in the experimental context. air resistance was deemed negligible in this experiment, so friction was the only value determined to be included in the y-intercept. friction decreases total acceleration. because the mass of the system was kept constant throughout the experiment, the mass was determined to be the inverse of the slope in the experimental model. the equation $f=m a$ was able to be manipulated in to $a=\frac{f}{m}$, in which acceleration equals the inverse of the mass of the system multiplied by the applied force. this can be seen in the theoretical model determined. a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart would cause the cart to undergo a nonuniform acceleration. this is because a string with appreciable mass would cause the acceleration to increase as more mass is added to the hanging as the system progress forward on the track.

	one possible random error that occurred in this experiment was the string moving off the pulley. this would cause the resulting acceleration to decrease as the datastudio device would be unable to accurately and precisely record the velocity graph, and resulting slope of acceleration. through reduction of the distance and applied force due to hanging mass reduced the movement of the string off the pulley system. an uncalibrated or not zeroed scale would be a possible systematic error present in this experiment. not properly calibrating or zeroing the scale would result in an inaccurate mass of the system and affect the applied force calculations which, in turn, directly affect the acceleration.

one possible constraint present in this experiment which may have limited the generalizability of the results was presence of air resistance, which was earlier deemed to be negligible. the presence of air resistance in a laboratory setting would cause an effect on the acceleration, usually a decrease in acceleration. if air resistance was deemed to be negligible, then it would have to be included in the numerical value y-intercept value determined.
