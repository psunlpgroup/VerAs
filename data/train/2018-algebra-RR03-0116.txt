discussion and conclusion





in this lab the research question that was investigated was what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings.  this was accomplished through doing multiple experiments each with different independent variables. the angle of release vs. period length graph(figure 1.) and the mass vs. period length graph in figure 2, both showed no relation.  this is evident by the slope values of each graph.  the slope of figure 1 is .026 which is very close to zero and the slope of figure 2 is 2e-05 which is very close to zero.  both slopes show on the graphs that there is no relation between the variables.  a standard deviation was calculated for these experiments of .0155, error bars are shown on figure 1 and figure 2 but are too small to be seen. the data taken with length of the pendulum as the independent variable showed a relation to the period length, this can be seen in figure 3.2. the standard deviation of this data was calculated as .0005. the equation for the length of the pendulum vs. period was a power function which was $y=0.1944 x^{0.506}$ and had an r squared value of 1 (figure 3.2).  this value means the data is accurate with the power function.  this mathematical model also correlates with the theoretical mathematical model of period of a pendulum which is$t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. errors that were present in this lab included not starting or stopping the stopwatch at exactly the right time, and measuring the angle of release with a used plastic protractor.  starting the stopwatch is a random error and could be solved by using a photogate system which was used on our period length vs. length of pendulum experiment.  the second error was systematic in which the protractor was old and plastic, meaning it could be bent resulting in a consistent inaccurate angle of release each trial. constraints on this experiment included the time given to complete each lab.  the time given did not allow multiple trials of certain angles and masses to reduce error by taking the average of multiple trials (table 1 and table 2).
