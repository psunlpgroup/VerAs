	the length of string used was the independent variable in this experiment. it was the independent variable because it is the variable that we changed and measured between every trial. as the length of the pendulum changed we found that the period of one full swing of the pendulum changed as well. as we increased the length of the string attached to the pendulum we noticed that the period of one full swing was also increasing. also, the time keeper noticed that the stopwatch two of them were not functioning correctly, so we had to do the trial again and found that two of the stopwatches were working correctly. 

this addresses the research question that the length of the pendulum affects the period of one full swing of the pendulum. as you can see in figure 1 the r value found was 0.9974, and the graph is positive linear relationship. also, environmental factors that might have affected the results include but are not limited to miss calibration of the device that was used to record the period, and the marginal human error experienced when trying to drop the pendulum from the same release angle every trial.

the theoretical equation for the period of the pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, and the data for this experiment holds a linear relationship so this equation substituted with a tested length fits well with our previous data equation $y=0.01 x^{1.039}$. this supports our theoretical equation because as the pendulum length is being increased so is the period of the swing.  concluding i and my classmate who worked on these labs were confident with our results, most error were due to the time when we used stopwatch, but we re-did trials with functioning stopwatch and we were carefully following the procedure to get those result.
