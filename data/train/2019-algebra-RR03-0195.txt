discussion and conclusion

the research question that was tested throughout the experiments is “what impacts the period of a pendulum?”. lab 01 addressed the question through identifying the variables that are most likely to impact the period of a pendulum and from there they each were tested and graphed. using the data from lab 01, the second lab (lab 02) focused on possible errors in the experiment and finding the range of uncertainty and standard deviation. through the use of measuring technology such as the stopwatches and photo-gate we were able to conclude in lab 03 that the mass and angle of the pendulum are ineffective in relation to the period of a pendulum. to manipulate the period the most effective method was found to be the length of string. in lab 03 the equation from various string length trials was found to be $y=2.1251 x^{0.4727}$. from the data collected in lab 03 the trendline for the data passed through the plotted points leading to an r^2 of 0.99998. the theoretical model given didn’t fit within the confines of the string length test, so it was changed to be 0.80 (1.79512) for our group and our measurement was close to the theoretical (0.80(1.911)) and was only off by 0.11588. within the experiment we looked at error, specifically lab 02. systematic errors that were possible during the experiment were inaccurate measuring tools such as the protractor, tape measure and or stopwatch. possible random errors were variation in how the pendulum was released, significant string length variation and the delayed reaction time between stopping and starting the stopwatch on the command of another counting. future ways of reducing errors include using precise measuring tools but also running more tests then averaging them to lessen margin of error. there was a lack of constraints in the experiment, the generalizability of results can occur and is present.
