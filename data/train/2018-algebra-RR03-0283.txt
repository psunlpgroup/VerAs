discussion and conclusion

(none match pendulum function). throughout these three experiments we tested to see if there was any effect on the period of a pendulum swing when altering the mass at the bottom of the pendulum, the length of the pendulum string, and the angle at which we released the pendulum. frist starting with the effect of mass. after completing all of our trials, with weights ranging from 50g to 130g, we concluded there was no correlation between the mass at the bottom of the pendulum, and how long a swing period would take. this is represented in the graph of experiment one. as you can see the graph has an odd parabola shape rather than a steady         $x=y$           slope that should be represented if a correlation is present. next is experiment two. experiment two tested the relationship between the length of the pendulum string and the amount of time per period. when looking at the number you can see an increase at about 0.1 for each increment. this is also represented by the graph as there is a slope that is always increasing. with this given data we were able to declare a correlation between the dependent variable of string length and independent variable of time per pendulum period. lastly was experiment three where the relationship between drop angle and pendulum period was tested. when looking at the numbers and graph of this data it is clear to see the data is affected by random error. with this data we can conclude there is no correlation as the data is highly distorted. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is stated as          $t =2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$         which when on a graph with steady interval increase represents a power function slope. when looking at each experiment graph it is seen that none of our experiments correspond with the mathematical model. notice the slope of the graphs and the point that create these slopes, all of which do not have power function slopes. when looking at the graph of experiment 4 it does represent a power function. even though this is so this experiment still does not represent the pendulum function. as seen on the graph has an equation of       $y=0.469 x^{0.38}$       and an r squared value of 0.9621 rather than the pendulum function which is $y=0.2$.5 and an r squared value closer to one such as 0.9999. the actual values may be checked by plugging in our x values of length into the actual equation. these results may be from the error scattered throughout this lab. random error is noticed within our technique. having a person time the trials causes random error because a human cannot be perfectly accurate. random error is also associated with our drop angle as this may have varied depending on where the protractor was held and where the string was lined up, again human involvement. there was also systematic error present. this may be seen again with our technique as there were two different people involved in the trials, one dropping, one timing. this can lead to a systematic error lower than the actual values depending on the person reaction time. systematic error was also included with our equipment such as our tape measure which are not as accurate as other pieces of equipment. both of these types of error could be tremendously minimized with better more reliable equipment. along with better equipment, more trial runs would increase the reliability of our data leading to better results. when mentioning experiment four which had more precise and accurate equipment the error could be present from not being able to account for wind resistance and gravity.
