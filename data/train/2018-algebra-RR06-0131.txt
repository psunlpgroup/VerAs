the purpose of this lab was to determine if force had an effect on acceleration for a given system. in order to determine whether or not it had an effect we changed the force of a system by increasing the mass attached, and then calculated the resulting acceleration. we hypothesized that as the mass increased (causing an increase in force), the acceleration would also increase. after running 8 trials we organized our data into a data table and then created a graph. the mass of the system shows up in the slope of the line. our theoretical model of the best fit line was 0.0053 while our experimental model was 0.0061. the mathematical model to go along with these values is $y=x + 0.111$ where the prior values listed would take the place of x. in the second part of the lab we manipulated equations in order to see if we could achieve a desired velocity by calculating the needed mass to get that. we tried but were unsuccessful, most likely due to error.

many errors could have occurred throughout this experiment. errors could have been within the humans measuring the mass of the bobbers or the system. there is also potential for calculation error, when determining applied force and such. systemic error could have occurred in the way the bobbers were attached or within the instruments we used. one way to reduce the error would be to conduct more trials. we believe that more trials would have given us a number closer to 0.0061. there were a number of constraints in this lab, such as the small number of trials. more trials always leads to more reliable data and sometimes decreased error. another constraint we had was in part 2 when trying to get a desired mass of 9.163 g because we really couldnâ€™t get that exact due to the mass of the bobbers and paper clips, as well as the balance.
