	The question being asked was which independent variable (length of string, mass of weight, or angle of release) would affect the period of the pendulum. All three tests compared together were able to show our group which variable affected the period the most. After all of our testing had concluded my group and I were certain that the length of the string was the only variable to definitively affect the period of the pendulum. If you look at the tables you can see the period time slightly variates for changes in mass and changes in angle but didn’t change nearly as much as the period for the change in string length. For the change in mass the time stays between 1.35 and 1.50 seconds (a variation of only 0.15 seconds), for the change in angle the time is between 1.20 and 1.50 seconds (a variation of 0.30 seconds), but for the change of string length the time varies between 1.826 to 2.890 (a variation of 1.064 seconds). You can also look at the graphs that accompany the tables and see that the length of the string affected the period the most. Visually you can see that the lines in the graphs for Mass vs Period and Angle vs Period don’t have much, if any, of a slope and resemble a straight line. If the independent variable had affected the period there would be more variation in the y-axis and a larger slope. This variation of the y-axis can be seen in the graph Length vs Period. The mathematical model $y=b + mx$           was used to describe the data line in the graphs and shows the correlation between the variables. Slope is a good indication if the independent variable has any effect on the dependent variable, generally the larger the slope the more the independent affects the dependent. The slope (m) for Mass vs Period and Angle vs Period is relatively low at -0.0003 and 0.0038, respectively. On the other hand the slope of Length vs Period is 0.009; almost triple that of the other highest slope. The slopes are directly based off the data entered in the original tables and as a result match what the tables and graphs show. Our group tried our best to limit errors but some were still present. At the beginning of the experiment the stopwatch was either stopped too fast or too slow, resulting in a systematic error for that group of data and times that were either way too slow or way too fast. To fix this our group threw out the bad data and retested. During the retest we made sure to stop the stopwatch more accurately which led to better data. Still the systematic error of pressing the stopwatch too quick or too slow is slightly present. To combat this you should use a computer that can track the times for you so it is more accurate. We used the photogate for our last trial and in the future would recommend using it for all your trials to get the most accurate times. Some of the constraints found in our experiment were things such as; our string only being able to reach 200 cm and our weight only being able to increase to about 150 grams. Therefore our mathematical model is useful for string lengths under 200cm and weights under 150 grams.
