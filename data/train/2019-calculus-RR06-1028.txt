conclusion: 

	in conclusion both our guesses of the outcome of the independent variable on the dependent variable were correct. our hypothesis and prediction of the mass pulling on the cart increasing the acceleration and the mass added to the cart decreasing the acceleration were both correct. not only did we have solid data to support this even if there were minor errors, our classmates also had similar data to support the same findings.

increase of mass will increase acceleration along with the increase of angle in the other direction of the sledâ€™s movement. the acceleration will decrease when the angle is increased in the same direction of the sled. 


the graph will have a positive slope in relation to weight, but have an inverse relationship with the angle as its increased on the side that the sled is going, and a positive relationship when the angle is increasing in the opposite direction of the sleds movement. 

the experiment is  this experiment was run the same as the experiments in lab 05, just with a different objective. this was the results of the experiment is 







this data proved the groups predictions and hypothesis to be correct based on the back that the slope of the line became stepper when increasing the angle.
