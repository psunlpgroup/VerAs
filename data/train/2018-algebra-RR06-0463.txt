discussion and conclusion:

 this experiment explored the question, how does applied force impact the acceleration of a system. in this experiment, we use the hanging weight as the independent variable. we can have this, because when the rail is turned on the weight of the hanging weight is the main force acting on the cart causing it to move from rest. therefore, we define the hanging weight as the applied force, our independent variable. in this experiment we varied the weight of the hanging weight to see its effect on the acceleration of the system. in graph 1, we see the relationship of the applied force and acceleration is linear. as the applied force increases so does the acceleration of the system. the error bars of this graph are set at one standard deviation and do not overlap. the equivalency criterion is set at two standard deviations. when the error bars of graph 1. are set to two standard deviations, they still do not overlap, leading us to believe that our data points are significantly different from one another. thus, the claim that when the applied force to a system of constant mass increases so does the acceleration of the system can be made. the findings of other groups support our results and conclusions without any discrepancies. groups, squirt and the uncertainties, found the same relationship between applied force and acceleration of a system. this relationship was linear, and they concluded that as applied force increases so does the acceleration of a system. they both compiled graphs of their data points which fell outside of the equivalency criterion (the error bars for two standard deviations did not overlap). the theoretical equation for the relationship between force applied and acceleration of the system is $a=\frac{f}{m y}$, where f is the force applied to the system or fhanging, a is the acceleration of the system, and is the mass of the system. we kept the mass of the system constant, so only f and a would change. the mathematical model that we found from our trials was $a = 0.005 F - 0.0121$ or $a = \frac{f_h}{200}- \frac{2.42}{200}$. from the curve fitting we found the relationship to be linear with an r-squared value of 0.9988. after looking at the theoretical model, we concluded that the slope of our experimental model was the inverse of the mass of the system. our experimental model does not support the claim that we had a single force acting on our system. the theoretical model only accounts for one force being applied to the system, but in reality, we did not have the proper equipment to negate all other forces. on our experimental model we see a y-intercept that accounts for unknown forces that are acting upon the system, such as friction or gravity (due to the surface not being exactly level). since our y-intercept is negative, we can conclude that the unknown force acting on the system was mainly friction because it was opposing the positive force applied by the hanging mass. to get the acceleration of the experimental system with two forces acting upon it, we can rewrite the theoretical equation to be $a= \frac{f_h}{m y} + \frac{f_u}{m y}$  and rearrange our experimental equation to look like this, $a = \frac{f_h}{200}- \frac{2.42}{200}$, where 200 is the mass of the system in grams and -2.42 is the unknown force (recorded in newtons) acting on the system. if a heavier string was used in the experiment but the weight was not accounted for in the mass of the system i would expect to see all of the calculated acceleration values to undergo a systematic decrease from where they are currently, because if the same force is applied to a system with a greater mass according to the theoretical formula, $f=m a$, a smaller acceleration will be need to accommodate the increase in mass to have the same force applied. some possible sources of systematic error are the possibility that the rail was slanted, friction, and the weight of the string. some solutions to decrease the impact of these error are finding the mass of the string and adding it to masssystem and recognizing that the y-intercept of the experimental mathematical model account for some of the unknown forces acting on our experiment. a possible source of random error is user error with the balance. a solution for this error is to measure mass of the system multiple times and average them. some constraints on this experiment were the presence of some friction that we could not quantify, limited sample size, and uncertainty of measuring instruments. this might affect the generalizability of the results because the friction makes our experimental mathematical model deviate from the theoretical model because we could not account for the friction right at the start and use the net applied force. also, a larger sample size would allow us to be more confident in our claims and have more evidence to back them up. the uncertainty of the measuring instruments introduces uncertainty in our collected data which we derive our claims and conclusions from.
