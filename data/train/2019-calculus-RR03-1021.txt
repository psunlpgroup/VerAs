discussion and conclusion: 

	the question for this lab is what affects the period of the pendulum. by analyzing all of the data collected over the last three lab periods, that question can be answered. 


	by setting the angle of release and the length of the string constant and making the mass of the pendulum bob the independent variable, it can be determined whether the mass of the pendulum bob affects the period of the pendulum. by referencing the data collected in the mass test, the slope of the best fit line of the data is very close to 0, which means there was very little change from a low mass to a high mass. also, a horizontal line could be drawn and fit inside all of the error bars which are a length of two standard deviations away from the mean which means that it can be concluded with about 95% certainty that the mass of the bob has no effect on the period of the pendulum.

	by setting angle of release and the mass of the bob constant and making the length of the string the independent variable, it can be determined whether the length of the string affects the period of the pendulum. the data collected in the length test shows that the slope of the best fit line of the data has a noticeably positive slope. we can confirm that the length of the string is directly related to the period of the pendulum by confirming that the best fit line of the data goes through all of the error bars that are set at two standard deviations away from the mean. this means that we are about 95% certain that the length of the string has a direct relationship to the period of the pendulum. 

		the theoretical equation of the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ where p is the period (s), l is length of the string (m), and g is the force of gravity (m/s^2). the mathematical equation that was experimentally found was $y = 2.0396  x^{0.4484}$ where y is the period (s) and x is the length (m). these units suggest that the coefficient 2.0396 has the units of s / m ^ 0.4484. our experimental model supports the mathematical model because the theoretical model can be broken up into $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. since 2π and sqrt(1/g) will always be the same, they can be calculated. that value is 2.0071. so, the theoretical equation comes out to $t = 2.0071  l^{0.5}$ where l is the dependent variable so it can be interchanged with x (and p with y because it is the dependent variable). theoretical equation is  $y = 2.0071 x^{0.5000}$. experimental equation is  $y = 2,0396  x^{0.4484}$. these two equations are very close especially for the low-tech equipment we were using to obtain our data. so, the experimental model does support the theoretical model. also, the experimental model that we got was very close to the model obtained by other groups. ($y =0.2886 x^ {0.4322}$ and $y=2.1186 x^{0.4234}$)

		there is one main source of random error in this experiment which is the timing on the stopwatch. this was accounted for when running the experiment by having all four group members each time the same event so an average could be made, but hand timing one period of a pendulum will never be perfect. one way to alleviate this source of random error is by using a photogate which was done during lab 3. 

		some sources of systematic error include the balance not being calibrated properly, the tape measure being off, the protractor being off, and the stopwatch not being calibrated properly. these systematic errors can’t really be reduced without buying new equipment or calibrating the old equipment but that isn’t necessary because systematic error just shifts the mean of the data so it doesn’t affect trends or relationships between the independent and dependent variables. 

		some constraints within the experiment are not having a vacuum chamber to test in, as well as not having a consistent dropping and timing mechanism. the theoretical equation for a simple pendulum is made for use in a vacuum chamber with no air resistance. since we don’t have access to a vacuum chamber, we are assuming that there is no air resistance which skews our data and experimental model slightly. the same goes for the dropping mechanism. dropping the bob of the pendulum by hand is inconsistent and may add unwanted initial velocities that skew the data.
