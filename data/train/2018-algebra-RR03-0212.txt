conclusion:
We set out to determine if angle of drop, length of a pendulum or, weight of a pendulum would affect the period of a swing. We first manipulated each of these factors and then manually recorded the effect on a stopwatch. This experiment had the possibility of multiple sources of systematic error from improperly set up equipment to uncertain measurement tools. However, more concerning than systematic error was the random error we introduced by relying on human reaction time to manually time the start and stop of a period. These sources of error added a large margin of uncertainty to our data. So, we calculated out standard deviation and graphed error bars for the first experiments and determined an equivalency criterion of 2* standard deviation to determine what might be significantly deviating from the norm.  We then took the variable that appeared to have the greatest likelihood of statistical significance, length, and redesigned an experiment to eliminate 
some of this error. We did so by carefully setting up a pendulum that would swing across a photogate. This allowed for significantly more accurate ability to measure time of a period, our dependent variable. We then recorded a wide range of data points. We did so in an attempt to see a more complete picture of how length might be associated with the period of a pendulum. Our data points were the graphed and fit with a line with a far smaller uncertainty. The line in question had an equation of $y=0.2038 x^{0.495}$ and had an r squared value is to 0.9994. This indicates that our data very strongly adhered to the line of best fit and it likely accurately represented the phenomena we observed. The mathematical dependence between the period and the length is . So, while we failed to fully replicate the mathematical model we graphically produced an accurate approximation of the relationship. We therefore, believe that we have shown a relationship between length of a pendulum and the period of its swing.
