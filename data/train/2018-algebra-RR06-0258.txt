conclusion 



the objective of our experiment was to understand the relationship between acceleration and force. to better figure out the relationship our group conducted an experiment using an air tract, fishing bobs for mass, a cart and a data system to collect our results. before collecting all the data we predicted that our graph would be a straight positive line. after collecting all the data we plotted the points and a line of best fit showed a positive linear correlation. after comparing our mathematical models to other groups looking at our own data we can confirm that we accept our hypothesis.
