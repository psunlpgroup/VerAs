Discussion and Conclusion:

The purpose of these labs was to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system and to develop an understanding of each variable and numerical value included in these models. The research question answered was how the mass, applied force, and friction affected the acceleration of the cart.

The mathematical model from the first experiment in lab 05 was $a=2.797 F-0.007$. This model was obtained by plotting the acceleration of the cart against force applied to the cart. The values for applied force were obtained by multiplying the value of the hanging mass by the known value for acceleration due to gravity. When plotted (Figure 1), the graph has a linear relationship that can be expressed with the mathematical model found using a trendline. The slope of this model represents the inverse of the mass and the y-intercept is caused by friction. The mathematical model from the second experiment in lab 05 was $a = 0.1096 m^{-2.067}$ . This model was obtained by plotting the acceleration of the cart against the mass of the cart. When plotted (Figure 2), the trendline of the graph had a power relationship which is expressed using the mathematical model. In this model, the coefficient of the mass represents the value of the applied force and the value for the power should be -1. This is not the case due to experimental error. For both experiments in lab 05, error bars were added to the graph using the value of 0.01 which was determined by determining the accuracy of the instruments used. The error bars on both graphs are too small to be seen which allows the claims to be made that the acceleration increased as applied force increased, and that the acceleration decreased as the mass increased because there was no overlap of error bars. The experiment in lab 06 resulted in three different graphs (Figures 3,4,5) of the acceleration of the cart versus the applied force. The difference between these graphs is that magnets were placed at different heights on the cart causing the friction to change. The three models found from the linear trendline of these graphs were  $a=3.0061 F-0.4809$ (Figure 3), $a=2.457 F-0.3407$ (Figure 4), and  $a=1.8345 F-0.2107$   (Figure 5). As in the first experiment, the slope represents the inverse of the mass but is affected by the frictional force and the y-intercept is caused by the frictional force.

When comparing to other groups, we arrived at the same conclusion that increased friction causes the acceleration of the cart to decrease and that changing the position of the magnets changes the friction. The second group had a different independent variable, so it was harder to compare our specific hypothesis to theirs, but both experiments had to do with different factors that could affect the experiment. These groups models help illustrate that the acceleration decreases at increasing values for friction and gives us models to compare our own to.
One error caused in this experiment was the effect of friction and air resistance on the acceleration of the cart. This was reduced by using a system that creates an almost frictionless surface but would have caused systematic error had this not been reduced. Another error was due to error in taking measurements for mass and acceleration. These were both random errors due to the limitations of the instruments used and could be reduced by taking more trials.  
One constraint that could not be tested was the effect of gravity on the acceleration of the cart. This means that the model cannot be generalized to systems affected by different accelerations due to gravity. Another constraint was not being able to adjust friction to a specific and measurable value. This meant that only a general conclusion of the effect of friction could be determined. Another constraint not tested was that string had very little mass which was not accounted for. If a heavier string were used, this would increase the mass of the system. I predict this would cause the acceleration to decrease.
The first mathematical model from lab 05 was $a=2.797 F-0.007$ . This can be compared to Newton’s Second Law by rewriting it as $F=\frac{a}{2.797} a+0.13866$. This shows a similar relationship as Newton’s Second Law, $F = m a$ since the force and acceleration have a linear relationship. This mass of the system should then ideally be the inverse of the slope and the y-intercept would be zero if the track were completely frictionless. The mathematical model from the second experiment in lab 05 was $a= 0.1096 m^{-2.067}$ . This can be compared to Newton’s Second Law by rewriting his law as $a=\frac{f}{m}$. Both models are power functions which shows they are similar. Newton’s Second Law can compare to the model we obtained where the force should be the coefficient and the power of the mass should ideally be -1. Unfortunately, error caused this value to be off. The models in lab 06 can be compared to Newton’s Second Law just as the model in the first experiment was. The models of $a=3.0061 F-0.4809$ , $a=2.457 F-0.3407$, and  $a=1.8345 F-0.210$ have the same linear relationship between the force and the mass. The difference between the models is that the force of friction affects the values obtained.
