conclusion:
The mass and period have a very linear relationship. This means that mass has no effect on the period. However greater or less the mass would be the period would be the same. This experiment was done by different measures of mass and period was measured. In order to reduce the uncertainty three people measured the period five times and then the average was taken out. Error for mass taken into account was 1g and period is 0.2s. Uncertainty would be 0.5 g and 0.1s respectively. (Error bars are included but too small to see). Human reaction time was a very big reason of error. Another error would be the difference in actual and written weight of bob, as most of them were chipped or had dents in them.

The relationship between the length of the string and period was that of an power one. As the length increased the period also increased. They are also highly related since the correlation is very high approximately 0.99996. The equation of the pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ . The mathematical model of this graph is $y=0.2037 x^{0.4968}$  . This is very close to the actual theoretical model. If a value from the data table is chosen and used in the theoretical equation it clearly supports the mathematical model. Error for length is 0.1 cm and for period it 0.2 s. Uncertainty is 0.5 cm and for period is 0.1 s. (Error bars are present but too small to be seen). The random error of measuring the period was reduced by taking multiple samples and averaging them out.


the research question for the experiment was addressed and the predictions made for the first and the last variable were wrong. we faced difficulty in measuring the period for small angles. as we were required to be more accurate. the errors were calculated and were taken into account for.
