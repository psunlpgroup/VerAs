conclusion:
the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models that would describe the behavior of a real system. additionally, the purpose also included developing an understanding for each variable and numerical value in the model. in all of our experiments, the mathematical models were developed by finding the slope equation for the graphed data found during the exam. this was done using microsoft excel to evaluate the data. one systematic error that was not checked for in lab 05 was if the airtrack in the experiment was level. another error that was not tested was if the photogate was not calibrated correctly. this error could be reduced by hand-calculating the acceleration and comparing it with the data. constraints in the experiment include there being no friction and only being able to test up to 8 bobs.for both mathematical models, the values that are calculated in the models are the same that can be found using newtonâ€™s second law.
