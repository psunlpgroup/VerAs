discussion and conclusion:

the research question posed at the beginning of this experiment is how variables such as mass, length, and angle affect the period of a pendulum. the main conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that length has a positive relationship with period. as can be seen in figure 1, the period got longer as the length of the string was increased. figures 2 & 3 do not show such a relationship, changing the mass and angle did not appreciably change the period in any way. the mathematical model for the period is equal to 2pi times the square root of length over gravity. our experimental data supports this model since length was the only variable that changed the period. according to the model, angle and mass are variables that are in no way connected to the period, just like something trivial such as the color of the bob. the only real variable according to the model is length, assuming all experiments take place on earth gravity will remain a constant of -9.8. one large source of error that we encountered at first was the human error associated with the stopwatches. starting and stopping the watch at the exact correct times by hand is nigh impossible, so we used a stopwatch for each person and averaged the times to reduce this error. another error we experienced was that while it was possible to measure the angle in the x direction, it was not possible to do so in the z direction. this means that the pendulum was technically not dropped from the same point every time, and this could have affected the period from trial to trial. further experimentation could make increased use of photogates to reduce human error, and could test an increased range of lengths.
