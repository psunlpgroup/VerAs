conclusion 

1 lab 5 we were looking for mathematical models to help describe the behavior of a system and in lab6 we trying to understand the variable and numeral value of the model.

2 we tested each experiment changing elements of it and that gave us data that we then plotted and that is what gave us our data

3 



their data was similar, and we got similar equations that were decreasing as well

4 systematic because we could have user error on starting and stopping the system

5 the mass not being right in the dot accurate.

6 the slope of the system shows newtons second law as it increases
