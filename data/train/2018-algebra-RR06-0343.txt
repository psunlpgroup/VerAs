discussion: 

this experiment was conducted in order to determine a relationship between acceleration and the force applied to it. it was originally predicted that the relationship would be positive and linear (as the applied force increases, the acceleration will also increase. based on the results achieved throughout the experiment, as portrayed by the table and figure above, this prediction was accurate. our graphical equation yielded to be $y=4.6144 x - 0.0227$ proving that the relationship is positive and linear, given that all forces applied are positive. error bars are not shown in figure 1, due to the notion that they were too miniscule to be seen. this is supported by our r-squared value of .9974, which states that our data is fitting of nearly 100% of the linear trendline. with the theoretical model with a single force (r-squared value of 1) being [$a=f_{applied} m_{sys}$], the mathematical model achieved through this data is a very close fit, further supporting the original claim. the mathematical model for acceleration with respect to multiple forces is shown by [$a=f_{applied} m_{sys}-f_{friction}$. our experimental model supports this claim, as shown by our equation above. our experimental model is supported by the experimental models of other groups as well. for example, group 2 achieved an experimental model of $y=4.7453 x+0.0775$, with a similar prediction that there should be a positive, linear relationship between acceleration and an applied force. a photograph of their summarized data and design template, with the experimental model included, is shown below. furthermore, group 1 had similar experimental findings as well. they achieved a mathematical model of $y= 0.3123 x + 0.2789$, with an r-squared value of 0.9374. a photograph of group 1â€™s experimental data with the experimental model is also shown below. 
using a string with considerable mass is  if this same experiment was conducted using a string with a significant-enough weight, the system would not undergo a uniform acceleration. as the cart progresses further and further along the air-track, the ratio of string that is above the track compared to that below the track nearer the hanging mass changes. if there was weight to the string, that means at some points there would be more mass nearer the cart, and some points where the majority of the mass was nearer the hanging mass, providing unreliable experimental data. 
possible sources of error encountered in this experiment include both systematic and random error. one source of random error would be miniscule imperfections in the surface of the track, causing the cart to travel unevenly. these possible bumps/scratches would hinder accurate data and would be very hard to account for. one way to ensure that this error is avoided is to make sure the air current is continuous across the track. a systematic error encountered within this experiment could lie within the calibration of the triple beam balance is  if it was incorrectly calibrated, all things that were weighed on it would be systematically higher/lower, depending on the mis-calibration. 

one constraint discovered in this experiment was a cap on the weight is  there was a limited number of bobs during lab 05. this means that only a certain number of trails could be accurately tested, limiting the experimental data. a second constraint was that since a friction force of 0n is very difficult to achieve, it could not be directly determined if there was no friction in this experimental design with the materials given. since friction acts as an opposition to the applied force, this would affect our experimental design and model.
