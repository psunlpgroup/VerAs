discussion & conclusion: 

	the results from this lab supported the hypothesis that as the hanging mass on the system changes, the acceleration of the block in the system will change and the prediction was accurate that as the mass on the hanging end of the string increases, that will in turn increase the force being applied to the system and will result in the acceleration of the block to increase, which can be proven by the graph in figure 2 along with the data taken by other lab groups in the section. all groups, including mine, had graphs that showed a linear correlation between acceleration and force applied within the system giving the two variables a direct relationship to each other. using the theoretical equation, $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ it was easy to make sense of the equation we got for the slope on the acceleration vs. force graph, which gave an equation in the format of $a=c1 w+c2$. it linked acceleration to force when given a constant mass for the system. for lab 5, team archer reported a slope of 5.06, which is very close to our slope of 5.15 and even though team red marker reported a slope of 4.7 that wasn’t similar to either one of our groups’ finding, they were still able to make a similar conclusion about the relationship between acceleration and force applied showing that this experiment can be replicated multiple times and still give back similar results each time. $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$  is the theoretical equation that we used to check the accuracy of our experiment with the actual newton’s law components in lab 6. using this equation and a given the acceleration of 0.541 m/s^2 it was up to the group to calculate the mass of the system and the distribution of that mass onto the hanging end of the string to match the exact acceleration as closely as we could. our groups ended up calculating a mass of the system is 0.3358 kg, mass of the cart is 0.2955 kg, force is mass of the $m g = 0.00195 * 9.8$ so 0.01911. this resulted in our first attempt having an acceleration of .580, which is within parameters of being +/- 0.100 m/s^2. equation is  $0.541=\frac{1}{0.2955 + b}  (b 9.8)-0.0515$. 

	in conclusion, this lab was very successful with our group failing to reject the hypothesis in lab 5 along with correct calculations and predictions for lab 6. some errors that could have contributed to the slight inaccuracies in this lab include uncertainties with the masses of the bobbers, mass of the system, friction, air resistance, length of string, and operation error.
