discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of this lab was to develop models that present the behavior or a real-life scenario. this was done by experimenting if friction affects the acceleration of a cart by adding magnets to a cart on a frictionless track, therefore adding friction. 



this experiment was also done to understand how and what each variable represents in the real world. this was done by adding magnets to a cart on a frictionless track in order to add friction. 



friction on the cart is  the relationship between the independent variable (friction) and the dependent variable (acceleration of the system) has a correlation because the graph has a positive, linear slope.  as the friction increases, the acceleration decreases.



hanging mass of the cart is  the relationship between the independent variable (hanging mass) and the dependent variable (acceleration of the system) is also a positive correlation because the graph is positive. as the hanging mass increases, so does the acceleration. 


group 1 is  we had the same hypothesis and found very similar data that we did.


unknown group # is  they tested if the slope of the track affects the allocation of the cart.
