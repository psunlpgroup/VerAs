discussion and conclusion 

	in this lab we are researching what aspects of a pendulum we can change in order to see a change in the period length of said period.  all three of the experiments and tests played a role in this.  by changing one aspect of the pendulum and keeping the other two the same we are able to see how changing one aspect affects the period length.  for example in both the graphs and tests for changing the length of the string and angle of release, we can see with the positive lines in both graphs that as you increase the angle of release and the length of the string, it appears the period increases. granted we can not be sure of this as some of the error bars overlap however it is likely.  though with test three and changing the mass of the pendulum, in the graph it can be seen as a straight line where the error bars all overlap thus meaning that it seems that even as the mass increase, the period of the pendulum is not affected.  the way to see if results showed change and the period were actually affected by changing some aspects, is seen in the slope of these lines.  a positive slope would mean as one aspect of the pendulum increases, the period length also increases and vice versa with a negative slope. however with a slope being flat, it means that as one aspect changes, the period length is not affected.  these “slopes” are determined by connecting the data points and trials in order to see a general shape of the data so that we can make generalizations.  as seen in the last statement about the error in our data, we can make generalizations due to the slopes of the lines however we can not be totally confident due to the error bars.

some possible errors were mostly human error as stated earlier due to not having entirely accurate means of of measurement.  possible ways to eliminate these errors would be using more accurate and consistent ways of measuring the period length as well as angle of release.
