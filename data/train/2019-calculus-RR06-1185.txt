discussion and conclusion



the purpose of this lab was to determine what impacts the change of velocity and acceleration of a moving object. the tests were performed on a frictionless track so friction would not be a factor. in this lab, we observed what factors change the velocity and acceleration of a cart on a frictionless track. 



 







our data was similar to that of these groups. this demonstrates the validity of our data and equations. the r values were similar between the sets of data which helps conclude that the equations were similar between groups and all values demonstrated that the equations were accurate.







errors in this lab include releasing the cart at different times, so the data collected was incorrect. this would be considered as a random error. we also ran into computer issues regarding measuring our data. this would be considered a systematic error. to improve the experiment, we could have performed more trials to strengthen the evidence, or we could perform the experiment in a vacuum to get rid of air resistance.
