conclusion:

	the group examined how the acceleration of a system changes when the magnitude of applied force changes, the mass of the system changes, and the friction applied change. given the miniscule error bars and the high r2 value, it can be determined that increasing the applied force linearly increases acceleration. this was corroborated with two other groups, which had a nearly identical theoretical model ($a = 2.8169 f - 0.0099$; $a= 0.0028 f - 0.0092$; $a= 0.0029 f -0.0123$) (1051l-003 group 3, 2019; 1051l-003 group 5, 2019). the other groups recorded mass in grams, which is why their values for the first coefficient is 1/1000th of the group’s. relating this to newton’s second law, the theoretical equation becomes $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ , with the first coefficient representing 1 over the system mass. expanding this out to include an external force like friction, the theoretical equation becomes $a=\frac{f_{applied}}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, revealing the second coefficient in our one-force model to be the sum of forces such as friction and wind resistance divided by the system mass. if the string in the system were replaced with one with a large mass, that would increase msys, and correspondingly decrease acceleration. 
systematic errors would include any tilt in the air track, and random errors would include any inadvertent headwinds or tailwinds. the systematic error could be corrected for by running the experiment left-to-right in addition to the right-to-left as tested, and random errors could be corrected for by averaging the results across many trials. the experiment is constrained by the length of the track (approx. 1 m), and the maximum velocity the cart can safely achieve on the air track, which limits the maximum force that can be applied to <1 n. while it is highly unlikely newton’s second law of motion would change when tested outside these constraints, it remains theoretically possible.
