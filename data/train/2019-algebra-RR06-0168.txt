discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of lab 05 was to make mathematical models that explain the trends of a system. the purpose of lab 06 was to understand how each variable and numerical value was included in the system.

for the three experiments, the mathematical model was obtained via plotting data points in excel. after plotting the data points, we had to use a best fit line to see which equation correlated the most with the line. for the first experiment in lab 05 we got      $y=0.2976 x + 0.0151$. the equation in terms of the experiment is actually             $a=0.2976 f + 0.015$ where “a” equals acceleration and “f” equals force applied. for the second experiment in lab 05, we obtained $y=\frac{0.366}{x^{0.893}}$. the equation in terms of the experiment is actually $a=\frac{0.366}{m^{0.89}}$ where “a” equals acceleration and “m” equals mass of cart. for the first experiment in lab 06 the equation was                             $y=0.2446 x + 0.0023$. the equation in terms of the experiment is actually           $a=0.2446 f + 0.002$ where “a” equals acceleration and “f” equals the force of the friction. for lab 05 we can conclude that the behavior would be that as force increases, acceleration increases and as mass increases, acceleration decreases. for lab 06 we can conclude that the behavior would be that as friction increases, acceleration decreases. these claims are even explained through the graph’s slopes and where the data points lie on the graph. 

this group (5) followed the same procedure as us, to where they would have to find how friction affects the acceleration via number of magnets on the apparatus. this group also seemed to have the same behavior as ours pertaining to that as friction (x-axis) increases, acceleration (y-axis) decreases.
for this group (2) they had a different way of measuring how friction would affect the acceleration. they had to test their friction by using risers on their apparatus to give it a forward tilt. for their behavior, they have it to where as frictional force increases, acceleration increases. the tilt in the direction of the acceleration would explain as to why it followed their behavior. to compare it to ours, it shows that the way the apparatus is tilted heavily influences the sign (positive or negative) of the acceleration which also shows because of the friction the apparatus experiences. 

the amount of errors in the lab were very miniscule because the experiments were running through the rotary motion detector. the rotary motion detector having a standard error of 0.001 m/s^2. other than that, there was human error by weighing the mass of the system and also the hanging mass (bobs) on the scale. both these areas would only affect the size of the slope and not the sign (positive or negative) of the slope because of the human error weighing the mass of the system. 

there are a couple constraints that limit the results of this experiment. constraint 1- the alleged frictionless surface that the apparatus moved across still had minimal friction which affected the acceleration of the system. constraint 2- we had a set amount of weight which gave us a smaller range to find out how force would fully affect the acceleration of the system. constraint 3- the thickness of the string that connected the system and hanging force could’ve been thickened, which would’ve increased the acceleration because of the extra force moving downward with the hanging force. 

both experimental mathematical models supported newton’s second law, $f=m a$. for experiments 5 and 6 the apparatus is closed, which means mass isn’t being added or removed. the mass was either being transferred to the cart or on the hanging force.  having a closed apparatus made using $f=m a$ easy because one of our variables were held constant (the mass). both mathematical models stated in the graphs, data, and also part b. of this discussion support the model of $a=c1 w+c2$ where c1 equals acceleration, and c2 equals mass.
