research question: what factors affect the period time of a pendulum?

	based on the data collected on one of the factors tested had any real effect on the period of a pendulum. that factor was string length. based on the results from the first experiment the “period vs string length” seemed to show a linear relationship but after further testing and research we found that the there is a power relationship between them. this gave us an value of .995 to support our data even further (figure 3.3). to prove our theory beyond the tests we researched the theoretical model for a pendulum. the equation is . we had 4.36% error, for this experiment we found this error was good as other factors such as air resistance may have affected the pendulum. the other factors tested didn’t show any logical correlation.  both showed what looked like a linear relationship but after further testing and research it was determined that this relationship occurred because of errors. this can be seen with error bars attached to figures 1-2 and 2-3. these error bars were passed of a standard deviation done in experiment 2. these error bars show that no relationship exists between the period and release angle and the period and the weight. other factors that were not experiment with or researched extensively include gravity and air resistance. while we can make predictions about how each these affect the period of a pendulum it is very costly to test. one way to test the air resistance is to put the pendulum into a vacuum. a vacuum is a space without air. here a proper experiment can be done to test how air resistance affects a pendulum. to test how gravity affects a pendulum it would need to be brought into space as it is very difficult to simulate zero gravity conditions on earth. to further improve this experiment more and more trials can be done. the more trials that are done the more accurate the data becomes.
