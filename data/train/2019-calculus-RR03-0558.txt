conclusion:
As shown in the graphs above, we included error bars to show the error. And we included a trend line to show the correlation of the relationship. Looking our data, you can see the relationship between the length and period and the lack of a relationship between mass and starting angle and period.
	After determining the relationship between the length and period we did another experiment with a more precise measuring tool to get a math model of the relationship. The data and graph (seen below) slightly differed from our original data.

Note that the error bars are to small to be seen in the above graph. Originally, we assumed that the relationship was linear. Now after getting more precise data, we found the relationship to be non-linear. The curve that best fits the data would be a power function. Using the trend line for the power function, we got an R-squared value of 0.9988. While using the linear trend line, we got an R-squared value of 0.9820.
	At the end of these experiments we proved that the length of string affects the period of a pendulum. The mass clearly doesnâ€™t affect the period shown in the relevant graph. The trendline proves that there is no correlation to affecting the period. The error bars show that we were within range of the correct data. The same above is true for the angle with no correlation affecting the period. The length as stated above, has a trendline that is a power function. This is showing the non-linear relationship. The math model that we got from our data was $T=0.92753802 L$. The random errors were the reaction time of the stop watch, the measurement of the angle with protractor, and the release from the book. The systematic error was the length of the string that was measured. Overall the data that was collected from the experiments conducted proved that there was a relationship between the length of a string and the period of a pendulum.
