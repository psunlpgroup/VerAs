discussion and conclusion

the question of whether or not changing the force applied to a system affects the acceleration of the system. an air track connected to a measuring system linked to a computer was used to calculate the acceleration for each different force we applied. the data we collected from this allowed us to conclude that changing the force does change the acceleration and that these two factors have a linear relationship. the mathematical experimental model is $y=46.976 x + 0.003$ and the theoretical model is 9.8m/188.3 is a. our mathematical model allowed us to account for factors such as any friction, irregularity in air flow, and gravity. these factors show up in the experimental model through our slope. this is evident when viewing our graph, which has a less steep slope as the theoretical model would have. these outside forces do not significantly affect our data, which is why our errors bars are so small. accounting for these factors gives our conclusion even more validity. the theoretical model is similar to our model except that it does not account for any outside forces besides gravity. if a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart was used, the uniform acceleration of the cart would be affected because we would be adding in more force as the weight falls. the acceleration graphed line would have a much steeper slope than the massless string acceleration. 


again, this data also supports my groupâ€™s findings. the graphed data is almost perfectly linear with an r^2 value of 0.9905 (ours was 0.9993) and a similar slope of $y=47.344 x-0.0216$. you can see the acceleration increased as the force applied increased. thus, the conclusion this group came to supports our conclusion.
