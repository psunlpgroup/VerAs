Conclusion:
How does acceleration of system change when force gravity changes?
When hanging weight (Force Gravity) was the independent variable the acceleration of the system was affected. With the mass of the system staying constant, increasing the hanging weight would also increase the force gravity. With this, the acceleration of the system would increase. The opposite of this would happen when the hanging weight had mass taken away from it and added to the cart. When this happened the acceleration of the system would decrease. This relationship can be seen as a direct positive relationship in the graph above (Figure 2). As the force gravity increased, the acceleration of the system increased.

For Lab 05 we were unable to share our results immediately with other groups as we ran out of time during lab. However, looking around the room we were able to somewhat gauge what other groups received. The next lab period, we shared the results in front of the whole class on the whiteboard. This gave us the opportunity to compare the results. For the most part our data was consistent with other groups except for the fact that they did not convert their grams to kilograms and were left with smaller decimals for the C1 value in front of the x in the slope equation. The other difference in our results came from our C2 value, which represented the error in our chart. Our value was smaller than some groups by a little bit, possibly due to us having less of an effect from errors, friction, or the elevation of the table.
The theoretical equation for acceleration of a system by a single force is derived from $F=m a$. The formula for acceleration is thus  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, where a is the acceleration, F is the Force, and m is the mass. Our experimental model was $y =2.982 x^{-0.06}$. Written in terms of a, F and m the equation is $a=2.982 F^{-0.06}$. This equation supports the equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{system}}$ because if you plug in values for F and msystem you will get one of the acceleration values in the table. For example, a is .384258 N/.33982 Kg. A then equals roughly 1.08 +/- .001. This supports the experimental model. The graph represents this relationship as well as you can see since the R^2 value is .9999.
How does the acceleration of a system change when the force of gravity changes? How do the outside forces affect the mathematical model?

The general conclusion for Lab 06 is the same for Lab 05, however we must now take into account the outside forces. Therefore, we are now experimenting with the elevation of the table to reduce the external force value. 
The group’s results shown above in Figure 9 show that friction did in fact also have an effect on the C2 value. This shows friction along with elevation of the table factor in to making up the external forces against the cart. Their results show that as the more friction is present, the slower the cart accelerates.

For a second group’s results we were unable to attain any of them as lab was let out and we could not photograph anybody else’s.

The enhanced theoretical equation is used for the second experiment since we are now taking into account outside forces. The equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ represents this. This model is supported by our experimental models found in Figures 4,6, and 8. The equations for each change in elevation is found below. 

6.22 mm is   $y=2.7701 x + 0.0148$
9.39 mm is  $y=2.7733 x+0.0263$
18.84 mm is  $y=2.7521 x+0.0682$

These equations show that a change in elevation changes the C2 value, also known as the external force. Since the value changes from the original value of -.06, we can see evidence that the elevation of the table did indeed have an effect on the acceleration of the system. From these values, we can determine that the true evenness of the table lies between the starting point to an elevation of 6.22 mm.  

In the possible scenario that a heavier string is used to connect the hanging mass, we predict that the acceleration of the system would be slower since the mass of the system would be increased significantly. Since the equation of acceleration is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, the dividing factor would be larger since you are adding to the mass of the system and therefore the acceleration would be slower.

Possible random errors within the experiment include releasing the cart with a forward force, measuring the bobs wrong, and possible movement of the table. The error of reducing the cart with a forward force could be reduced by having a machine hold and release the cart so no velocity is given to it. Measuring the bobs wrong and assigning the wrong mass to individual bobs could cause for the hanging mass to be different. The movement of the table error can be attested to anybody knocking the table while the experiment is going, this could lead to a jump in the data.

Some constraints in this experiment would be the varying mass of the bobs and the inconsistency of the air track. These constraints can lead to inaccurate results. The mass of the bobs are constraints because they are not all identical in mass and therefore they are not all interchangeable. This leads to the results not being able to be generalizable. The inconsistency of the air track makes the generalizability less because all air tracks may push air out with varying force. This makes the experiment hard to replicate.
