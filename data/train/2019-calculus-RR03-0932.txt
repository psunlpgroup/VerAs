	the research question here is what impacts the period of a pendulum? through this lab and the experiments conducted in it the mass of the pendulum and angle of the period were both ruled out while the only thing discerned to affect the pendulum’s period was the length of the pendulum. this result was reached through much testing wherein each variable was tested while all other variables were held in constant.  this gave results for each variable that could be interpreted to find the correlation that each had to the period length. for mass the times seemed to stay the same and the same happened for the angle; meaning that they both had no correlation to the time. this result wasn’t found for the length of string, however. every time the length of string was increased so did the time it took to finish one period.
