discussion and conclusion: 

a. the purpose of this force and motion experiment was to conduct two different types of experiments, testing the effects of applied force and friction with a tilt on acceleration, and obtain mathematical models from the results. the second experiment focused on how the physical lab setting can affect the mathematical model determined. the research question for the first experiment conducted was represented by asking how the acceleration of a system changes when applied force changes. the research question for the second experiment controlled was represented by asking how the acceleration changes when friction changes.

b. the mathematical model found from lab 05 can be seen in figure 1. where the mathematical model can be represented by the equation, $y=3.0799 x - 0.1004$. this mathematical model found was by using excel, where the acceleration – 3.0799, x is hanging mass of m2, and then you subtract 0.1004 to find the acceleration of the cart, m1. this shows how the two variables are directly related, whereas the mass increases, the acceleration will also increase. this statement agrees with the linear trendline represented in figure 1. the value 0.1004 represents small, random error from the experiment. the r2 value, 0.9978, is very close to 1, indicating a very strong linear relationship between the two variables.

the mathematical model obtained from lab 06 can be represented by figures 2-4. were represented by the equations, $y = 3.1338 x – 0.0816$ with a r2 value of 0.9984 was obtained,        $y = 2.8275 x – 0.0024$ with a r2 value of 0.9999 was obtained, and $y = 2.874 x + 0.0221$ with a r2 value of 0.9998 was obtained. these mathematical models were found by also using excel, where the values follow the equation of $a = c1 f + c2$. by multiplying the mass of the system by the force applied to the system, acceleration can be found, and c2 represents the external force over the mass of the system. 



group 2 did a similar experiment as our group, where they tested the effect of friction with a tilt on acceleration, seen in figure 5. their mathematical models agree with our mathematical models obtained, where you can see that the acceleration increases with the applied force, in a linear fashion. their r2 values are very close to 1, similar to our r2 values, agreeing with the strong linear relationships between the two variables.

d. random and systematic errors may have been present for both experiments. improvements that could have been made to decrease error with the experiments include improving the system of how the rope can pull the cart and having the air track have an equal psi throughout the whole system. improving the accuracy of the tilt and conducting more trials could result in more accurate results as well. 

e. possible constraints in this experiment could be due to human, random, error. these constraints could be reduced by performing more trials, allowing more accurate and precise results to be obtained. this was not able to be done due to not having enough time in the lab period to perform more trials. 

f. newton’s second law, represented by the equation seen in figure 1. from lab 05, is seen as    $y=3.0799 x - 0.1004$. this equation agrees with newton’s second law, where 3.0799 is the average acceleration multiplied by the mass. if we would have conducted more trials, we could have possibly seen a more accurate value than 0.1004 to agree more with newton’s second law. newton’s second law can be represented by the equation, $a = c1 f +c2$, where both mathematical models obtained from lab 05 and lab 06 accommodate for force over mass. the value we got for c2 would be a small mass for small systematic error present in the experiment.
