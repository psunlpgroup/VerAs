discussion & conclusion



the research question being tested in this lab was “how does the acceleration of the system change when the hanging mass of the system is changed.” the purpose of the lab was to use newton’s laws to obtain an explanation for how the force applied by the hanging mass was related to the acceleration.  the mathematical model of our experiment is $y=5.1023 x - 0.0202$ which can be found in figure 1.  this equation shows that there is a positive linear relationship between acceleration and the force applied to the system.  this also shows that as the hanging mass increases, which was the independent variable, so will the force applied and therefore the acceleration as well.  this is known because “y” is the acceleration and x would be the force applied.

as seen in figure 2 group 3g1b’s data support our data. this can be seen as they also acquired a positive linear experimental mathematical model.  the only differences in their experimental model are the exact numbers of their equation.  they have 4.691 as their c1 and a (-.0891) as their c2 compared to our 5.1023 c2 value and a  (-.0202) c2 value.  these differences are explained by us having different system masses.

 as seen in figure 3,  this group had the same hypothesis and control variable. group 1’s data supported ours by also showing a positive linear experimental mathematical model. however, their values for the model were much smaller than ours.  the difference in the value c1 is most likely from group one using just the hanging mass, while we used the force applied, that was calculated by multiplying the hanging mass by 9.8 m/s^2 then dividing by 1000.  

	in this experiment the mathematical model is $y=c1 x +c2$, this relates to the theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{system}}$  when c2 is equal to 0.  in order to find the theoretical acceleration, the equation is fapp*msys. first solving for fapp, which is (hanging mass x 9.8)/1000 gives us a value of .04753 n. our mass of the system was .18886 kilograms, multiplied by .04753 gives a value of .252 m/s^2 as the acceleration. the experimental acceleration we obtained was 0.210m/s^2 giving a difference of .042m/s^2 between the theoretical and experimental when no other forces are involved.  the other force that would be involved would be friction. when friction is accounted for, the theoretical equation is $y=\frac{f_{applied} + f_{friction}}{m_{}sys}$, and the experimental equation is $y=c1 x+c2$ ($y= 5.1023 x-0.0202$).  the c1 value is obtained by the equation 1/msystem, which would be 1/.18886, giving a c1 value of 5.2949.  this shows a difference of .1926 in our experimental and theoretical values(theoretical is greater).  the force of friction was found based on our c2 value.  to find this external force the equation $f_{ext}=c2 m_{system}$ was used, giving a value of -3.8x10^-3 n. a negative fext value indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction of the system.

	if a string was used that was not massless than the system would have a larger overall mass, resulting in a larger acceleration. this can be seen by the positive relationship between hanging mass and acceleration in figure 1.  


	in this lab, a possible random error is that the bobbers or the system could have been measured inaccurately because the spring scale used was not digital.  systematic errors could have been from using an old scale that is worn out resulting in the weights on the scale to be an inaccurate mass. also, the datastudio could not be calibrated properly resulting in incorrect velocity values. the random error was reduced by weighing each hanging mass while moving bobbers from the cart to the hanging end of the string. the systematic errors could be solved by both having new equipment and making sure the datastudio has recently and correctly been calibrated. 

	 constraints on this lab were not having enough time to do more trials to further reduce any error. additionally, the lab was limited by the supplies given to us in order to weigh the system(bobbers, and paperclips).  therefore the results of the lab would be generalized due to the number of bobbers we were able to use making all the system masses similar.
