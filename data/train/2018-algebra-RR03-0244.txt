conclusion:
Figures 2 and 3 show there is no relationship between mass and period.  The scatterplot points are incoherent, Excel was unable to generate a reliable model, and a horizontal line can easily be drawn through each data point +/-standard deviation due to large variability in the data set.  Similarly,  Figures 6 and 7 show that a horizontal line can be drawn between each data point +/-2 standard deviations, so there is no relationship between drop angle and period. 
On the other hand, Figures 4 and 5 show that string length was the only independent variable tested that had a strong relationship with the pendulum’s period (no horizontal line could be drawn through all the data points’ error ranges and a strong model was generated). The hypothesis that string length is related to pendulum period could be conditionally accepted.  Nevertheless, given the error associated with the stopwatch timing method (σ is +/-0.0904s), an improved experimental design was needed to develop a more accurate model of the relationship between string length and pendulum period.  Thus, a fourth experiment was designed using a photogate (accurate to +/- 0.001s) to nearly eliminate the error associated with using a stopwatch.  The experimental design, measurements, and graphical depiction of the relationship are depicted below under Experiment 4, followed by a discussion of the improved experiment.
As depicted in Figure 9, a power relationship between string length and period was derived from the measurements. Excel-generated the formula is        $y=0.19 x^{0.5104}$         In Excel’s formula of the relationship, “y” is the period of pendulum (in seconds) and “x” is the string length (in centimeters).  The theoretical model widely accepted by the scientific community is represented by is      $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$          where T is  time in seconds, L is pendulum length, and g is gravity.  This model can be rearranged to , and if we convert gravity’s 9.8m/s^2 to cm/s^2, then the coefficient of x is , which is 0.2007cm per second squared.  
Side by side, the theoretical model of $y=0.2007$.5 and the Excel formula of       $y=0.19 x^{0.5104}$          are impressively close, but various types of error can still explain the reason for the slight difference.  First, with respect to random error, it is known that the photogate has random error of +/- 0.001s associated with it.  Similarly, the measuring tape has an error of +/-0.1cm.  The effect of these random errors can be minimized by taking a larger amount of trials.  Thus, taking additional trials using the same methodology and devices would reduce error even though the same likelihood of random error would exist for each individual error (these errors are spread over a much larger sample size, giving a more accurate depiction of the mean and greater predictive power of the model).
On the other hand, with respect to systematic error, each measured data point was affected by friction between the string and the pendulum stand.  The only way to reduce error associated with systematic error is to change the source of the error (repetition does not reduce systematic error), so using a more frictionless string would have less error than using the fabric string.  Other possible error such as that associated with wind or air resistance has a difficult-to-predict effect on the measurements, so taking the measurements in a more “vacuum-like” setting would enable Excel to generate a formula that is closer to the theoretical model than the one generated on 9/14/18.
After investigating what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings, it is apparent that string length is related to period, and longer string lengths have slower periods.  While science never fully proves anything, the data collected and analyzed in experiments 1 and 3 disproved the hypotheses that a pendulum’s period could be related to drop angle or pendulum weight, and the data collected and analyzed in experiments 2 and 4 supported the hypothesis that string length is related to pendulum period.  The model generated from the data in Experiment 4 was largely consistent with the theoretical model widely accepted by the scientific community.
