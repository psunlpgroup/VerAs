discussion:

the research question being investigated in this lab was for small swings, which factor impacts the period of a pendulum.  the first three experiments were run isolating each variable, by timing with a stopwatch the period of the pendulum.  this proved to be a much less accurate method, as the photogate was very accurate, it gave a r^2 value of 1.  the experiments changing mass and angle (figures 3-6) showed that changing the mass did not significantly change the period time, and that changing the angle of release did not significantly change the period time, respectively.  changing the length, however, showed a positive relationship vs. time when graphed (figures 1-2), and, when ran a second time with the photogate (figures 7-8), showed the same relationship, just with a much more accurate and precise layout of the data.  when the data for each variable is plugged into the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, the results are consistent with the graphs.  the experimental mathematical model is written as $p=-0.0003 l^2 + 0.0489 l + .5623$.  this was obtained through excel, and is a polynomial equation because the r^2 value was 1 when fit to a polynomial trendline with the data from the length photogate experiment.

to conclude, mass and angle do not affect the period of a pendulum, however length does, with a positive relationship.   our experimental value is significantly larger than the theoretical value, though, when plugged in to a random value.  theoretically, at 50cm, a 10 degree and 70-gram pendulum period should be 1.42 seconds.  with the polynomial equation we obtained experimentally, this period value was 2.2573 seconds.  that is almost twice as large as the theoretical value.  several error possibilities could have caused this, including human error of holding/setting up the pendulum incorrectly, which are random errors, and technological error with the scale, or photogate, which are systematic errors.  lastly, if more length values were tested, increasing the data set, this would have made the graph less generalized, also making the equation closer to the theoretical one.
