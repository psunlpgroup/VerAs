discussion and conclusion

	the experiments conducted in labs 01-03 were done to explain what truly effects the period of a pendulum. the first experiments conducted were mass and the angle of release. when we tested these two variables, we had noticed that there was no real correlation between the data collected. after adding in the error bars, we were able to see that the error bars overlapped. because of this we were able to safely say that these values found for the periods were probably the same value. the next experiment conducted was when we were testing the length of the string. as you can see from the data, as the length of the string increased the period of the pendulum increased as well. it was hard to tell exactly how the period increased during this experiment but later we tested the length of the string again using a photogate instead of a stop watch and we were able to get more precise measurements of the period. using the photogate, we were able to get a mathematical equation equal to  which when compared to the theoretical equation of  is extremely close. the biggest restriction on the experiment was how we had to use stopwatches to time the periods. once we were able to use a photogate, we were able to eliminate a lot of our random error which was caused by the stopwatches. some other random error in the experiment is not pulling the string of the pendulum taught during every single test or the possible bend in the arm itself that held the pendulum up in the air.
