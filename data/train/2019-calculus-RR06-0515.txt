conclusion:
For our first experiment (experiment 5), the research question we were testing how the acceleration is affected when the hanging force is changed. For our second experiment (experiment 6), we were testing how is the acceleration affected when there is a force of friction between the air track and the cart? 

Our claim for the hanging weight verses acceleration graph is that as the hanging weight (force) increases, the acceleration will also increase in a linear fashion. We know this because of newtons second law, $Force = Mass x Acceleration$, or $F = m  a$. Since the mass of the system was always held constant for the experiment, we can say $F = c a$. Therefore, as the force of the hanging weight is increased, the acceleration will have to also increase by the same ratio, giving us a linear graph. This claim is reflected in our Force vs Acceleration graph since there is a clear linear line that fits the data very well and there was an extremely small error (too small to be seen) since the was a very small error in the experiment. 


The findings of another group support our claim and our conclusions. Our equation of   $a=(2.4819 F) + .0513$ is very similar to other groups. Group number 4 that we decided to compare with had an equation   $a = (2.6742 F)-.0816$. This was very similar to ours, only having a slope of about 0.1 difference between our slopes and about .03 between our intercepts. This made us very happy since our claim held up for our model and another groups model. Our claims that as the hanging force increases, the acceleration increases linearly was dead on with this groups claim as well. The difference between our models most likely came from the use of different carts, bobbers and tracks as well as using different starting points to start to collect data from. If the measured mass of the bobbers and the cart were different from our measured masses, then that would cause a variation in models. These slight variations ended up making a very small, but noticeable difference. The second group that we compared to was group 2. They had the exact same claim is  as the hanging force increases, the acceleration also increases in a linear fashion. However, their model of $a = (2.928 F) – 0.093$ was a bit different than ours. This group had a slope that was more than .4 higher than our slope. These variations might have come from a difference in measurement or different materials used. Our track seemed to put out a little bit less air than other groups, which could have also explained why our slope was lower than others. Overall, our model and claims held up after comparing to 2 other groups despite small variations. 

Our claim for lab 6 was that as our friction force increases, the acceleration would decrease. Our lab 6 data deviated a small amount from the other groups data. This was mainly because as we added some weight (as in the magnets) to our cart, the cart would touch the track causing more friction than just what the Eddie currents provided. Our models for each of the three experiments were as follows is  

We compared our equations to a few other groups. The first was group 2. Group 2 had a model that was very similar to what we assumed ours was going to be like. The other groups data supported our claim since the change in their y intercept was increasing as the force of friction increases. Ours did not have a consistent increase telling us nothing about the relationship between the force of friction and the acceleration. The second group we compared to was group 5. Group 5 had great data with the external force consistently increasing throughout tests. This was much more accurate than our data. Their data also supports the theory that the y-int correlates to the external force on the system and in this case, it was the tilt of the air track.


The correct theoretical equation that we had for the acceleration of a system by a single force was is  $f=m_{system} a$ This means that there should be no intercept and the slope of the graph should have been (1/msystem). Our model was surprisingly close to the actual model. Since we had our mass of the system to be 341.3 grams or .3413 kg, the theoretical equation should have been $a = 2.93255 F$. It makes sense why our slope was smaller since in the real world there are other forces acting on the cart and the system would slow the acceleration. Knowing this, the experimental mathematical model does support our previous claim and supports the theoretical model as well.  


We know that the force of friction was supposed to increase as the magnets were added to the side, and as friction force increases, the acceleration should decrease. Therefore, the theoretical model does not support our mathematical model but does support the claim. Our graphs and mathematical models did not reflect that, but our claim did. The theoretical equation that we had for two or more forces was is  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. This equation was found again by using Newton’s second law is  $F = m a$. However, since there are multiple forces acting on the system, we had to take the sum of these forces to find the theoretical equation. These two forces were the force of the hanging mass and the force of friction provided by the Eddie currents. Our equation became $F_{Friction} + F_{Hanging mass} = m_{sys}  a$. then we divided everything by the mass in order to isolate a to get is  $a= \frac{f_{friction}}{m} +\frac{f_hanging}{m_{sys}}$ where the force of friction is negative because it opposes motion. This friction force was modeled in our equations by the y intercept. There was a slight amount of variation between the theoretical and experimental mathematical models since as we added the magnets to our cart, the cart would touch the track causing more friction and a different result than what we expected. 

If there was a heavy string, then the whole experiment would be changed. Since the heavy string would also create a force on the cart as it went over the pully, it would change the magnitude of the hanging mass. This might create a small curve in the graph since the force is always changing throughout that trial.
