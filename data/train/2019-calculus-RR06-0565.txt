conclusion:

my group came to the conclusion that the force applied on the system with positive inclination of the ramp decreases the acceleration of cart, while negative inclination of the ramp results in increase of acceleration of the cart. the data collected during lab, as well as known scientific knowledge or theories, can be used as evidence to justify your claim.  the questions below serve as a guide for evaluating all evidence that supports your claim. the investigation conducted this week was different from previous labs.  here, multiple experiments were conducted under different lab conditions. each resulted in a mathematical model of the form,  .  the models were then compared to see whether or not the numerical values, c1 and c2, were affected by the different lab conditions.  ultimately your group looked for patterns between changes in the dv (c1 and c2) as a result of changes in the iv (different lab conditions).
