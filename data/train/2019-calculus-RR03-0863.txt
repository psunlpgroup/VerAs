discussion and conclusion:

the research question was what impacts the period of the pendulum? is it mass, the angle or the length that affects it?  in the first experimient we measured all the different variables and tested each of them to see which affected the period of the pendulum the most.  we found out that the length was the only thing that affected the period of the pendulum compared to mass and angle having little or no effect on the time it took per swing.  in the second experimient, we found the margin of error and the range of uncertainty for each of the graphs.  this led us to finding that our graphs only had a 0.04s range of uncertainty with a very small margin of error.  in the final experimient, experimient 3 we found the mathematical model for all three of the different variables and graphs that we had.  this led us to the equation $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ which helped us solve for the different variables that we needed.  the theoretical mathematical model was the previously stated equation  $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$.  we compared this to the equations that we got and the equations we got for length vs. period was 6.41x^0.5 which is correct since if the equation is rearranged this is what it should look like.  we had random error in the first lab from us stopping the timers each time.  since we stopped it only after one period instead of us doing five periods and taking the average of those, we did it after only one period.  this increased our chances of us getting random error from us stopping the timer a little too late or a little too early.  as well as there was a chance of random error when we would measure the masses that we were going to use for the experimient since we used the scale and we could have inaccurately measured them and read the scale wrong giving us another possible chance of random error in the first lab.  in the third lab we got a systematic error since our computer was not working and was outputting us incorrect data.  the data had a pattern but was off compared to the correct data that we were given after.  this resulted in a systematic error that we could not control and resulted in tainted data, but the data did give us a pattern, so it was systematic and not random error.  a constraint could have been us having to use stop watches instead of computer timers since a computer timer would give us more precise times compared to us using our reaction time to get a time.  this is the only constraint that i could think of that could have a possible impact on the lab.
