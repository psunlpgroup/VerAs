discussion and conclusion

	after gathering and analyzing the data from the experiment, we can now answer our research question of “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?”. based on our experiment we can conclude that as the weight of the bobbers increases, the acceleration of the block also increases. as shown in the graph, when the bobbers were a smaller mass the acceleration was slow. as the mass of the bobbers increase you can see a positive trend in the graph. comparing our data with the data of another group showed that we both came to the same conclusion. both graphs had a linear trendline and showed the mass of the hanging weight had a positive correlation with the acceleration of the block. unfortunately my class has a total of 2 groups, so more comparisons could not be made. the theoretical model ( $a=\frac{f}{m}$) is supported by the mathematical model ($a=c1 w + c2$ because in the theoretical model it states that acceleration equals force divided by the mass of the system. in the mathematical model it is stating acceleration is equal to the mass of object one multiplied by the w plus the mass of object two. these two equations are will give you the same thing but it ask for different variables. the enhanced theoretical equation is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. if a heavy string were to be connecting the hanging weight and the block i believe that the acceleration would be faster. i believe this because as the hanging weight pulls more of the string down it will add to the mass of the weight pulling the block. thus raising the mass of the hanging weight. we have already established that as the mass of the hanging weight increases, the acceleration also increases. a heavier string would do just that. because the experiment was mostly done through technology there couldn’t have been that many random errors. one random error could’ve been while measuring the mass of the system wind or a faulty scale could have given the wrong mass of the system. also while measuring the acceleration the mass of the hanging weight swung a little. therefore the force of the hanging weight wasn’t going vertically down. this would result in a slower acceleration than anticipated. to avoid these an electronic scale would best to use and a closed environment will reduce the swinging of the hanging weight. some constraints in this experiment are that since we have such a small class we couldn’t compare our data with some group who’s data refuted ours.
