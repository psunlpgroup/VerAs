conclusion:
the question we were asked in this experiment was what variable would have the greatest impact on the period of the pendulum.  all three experiments addressed the research question because each lab day we were doing something in order to determine what variable changes the period the most. the claim we made before the experiment was that only the string length would change the period. after conducting all the experiments, we came to the conclusion that our hypothesis was in fact correct. you can confirm this by looking at our graphs. we noticed that only the string length was able to give us a good tread line. the other variables that were tested had a tread line that didn’t run through any points. you could see that period times were repeated and weren’t in a uniform line. from this you can make the conclusion that they do not have an effect on the period of the pendulum. our mathematical model was determined by the x-axis of string length and the y-axis of period. after we discovered the linear relationship and its equation, we learned that the relationship was period          $t=0.0122 l + 0.8223$             and that it supported our claim that the relationship would be linear. unfortunately, systematic errors cannot be reduced by repeating measurements multiple times and taking the average. however, it can be reduced by solving the problem, which in our case would be adjusting the scale accurately, fixing the digital stopwatch or use an automatic timer, and verifying that the air resistance is the same for each trial. when doing a lab experiment with a lot of potential errors like this one sometimes it is best to just use the equation you obtain from your graphs. random errors can be reduced by repeating the measurements for more trials and taking the average or by refining the measurement method or technique. in our case, we would either take more trials or use a more accurate form of measurement of time.

for the mass trials, there seems to be zero relationship between the independent variable  and the dependent variable  due to a big increase in mass in each trial and still seeing around the same values for the period of the pendulum. for the starting angle trials, there is a negative linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. the evidence from the five trials proves this is the case. for the string length trials, there is a positive linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable due to the evidence obtained from the experiment.
