Discussion and Conclusion

What impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. 
Referring to the Weight versus period graph the weight has no effect on the period of the swing. 
Looking at the Length versus period graph the length of the sting increasing results in the swing lasting longer each time. 
Finally, looking at the angle versus period graph the angle that it was released does change how long the swing lasts. 
Exponential is the trend line with the closest R^2 value to 1.0 of .9932, therefore it is the best mathematical model. 
People bumping the table while the pendulum was in motion is one error. 
Having only one person take the time of the swing is another. 
Not dropping at the exact angle. Length of string not being exactly correct.
Having a few people check the time, measure the string and check the angle can reduce the amount of error in the experiments.
