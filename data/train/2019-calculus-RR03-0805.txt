conclusion:
		

		during this lab, we were attempting to determine how the independent variables of string length, pendulum angle, and mass of the weight affected the length and time of the period. to do this, we did several tests where we would change the independent variables and see how each change affected the result of the period. we would repeat this several times for each test to ensure we had a good idea of how they affected the period. as shown by figures 1-3 and tables 2-4, the length of the string seemed to have a significant positive correlation with the period, the angle seemed to have a small positive or no correlation with the period, and the mass seemed to also have a slight positive or no correlation with the period.

		to solve for the period of a pendulum, the best method would be to use the theoretical mathematical model, which can be found by the equation is  $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ where t is period time in seconds, g is gravity in meters per second and l is string length in meters. the mass had no effect, nor did the angle when it was below 20 degrees, which it was for our test, as shown by table 10. our tests yielded an equation of 2.02x^.515 where x was the length of the string in meters, which was very close to the original equation, with the only errors able to be explained by the random error that comes from running an imperfect test. it would be difficult to generalize due to needing to increase the length of the strong by a significant degree, which would require a larger amount of string, as well as a much larger pendulum in general.
