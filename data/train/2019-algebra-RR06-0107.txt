discussion and conclusion 

	the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models that are representative of the behavior of an in-lab system as well as develop an understanding the variables and numerical values present in these models through manipulation of the physical lab setting. 

	the investigation of how hanging force impacted the acceleration of the system resulted in the following mathematical model $a=0.9699 f - 0.2527$. this model was developed by measuring the acceleration of the system (dv) after manipulating the hanging force (iv) on the system and keeping the mass constant at 0.8842 kg. the measured acceleration vs its respective force was graphed and fit with a linear curve (figure 2) resulting in the mathematical model above. the a in the model is representative of the system’s acceleration, and the f in the model is representative of the hanging force. these quantities are variables because the acceleration of the system (dv) changes with respect to the hanging force (iv). through dimensional analysis, the numerical quantity 0.9699 should have the units “1/kg”. this means that 1/system mass should be close to 0.9699. 1/0.8842 is 1.131, which is reasonably close to 0.9699. the numerical quantity -0.2527 has the units m/s2 which means there is some other force acting on the system experiencing an acceleration. it was concluded that this force was likely the force of friction. this mathematical model is very representative of the real-world situation it describes because the constant numerical values are close to the expected values. the claims can be confidently made because a horizontal line cannot be drawn through the points or their error bars in figure 2 indicating that each point is independent of the others. 

	the investigation of how system mass impacted the acceleration of the system resulted in the following mathematical model $a=0.0585 m$. this model was developed by measuring the acceleration of the system after manipulating the system’s mass and keeping the hanging force constant at 0.04802 n. the measured acceleration vs its respective mass was graphed (figure 4) and fit with a power curve resulting in the mathematical model above. the a in the model is representative of the system’s acceleration, and the m in the model is representative of the system’s mass. these quantities are variables because the acceleration of the system (dv) changes with respect to the system’s mass (iv). through dimensional analysis, the numerical quantity 0.05 should have had the units kgm/s2. this means that the constant hanging force should have been close to 0.05. the constant hanging force was 0.04802 n, which is very close to 0.05. the numerical quantity 1.17 should have been unitless and thus as close to 1 as possible. 1.17 is very close to 1, so this mathematical model is very representative of the real world situation it describes because the constant numerical values are so close to the expected values. the claims can be confidently made because a horizontal line cannot be drawn through the points or their error bars in figure 4 indicating that each point is independent of the others. 

	the investigation for how force of friction impacts the mathematical model obtained from figure 2 gave three mathematical models.  $a=2.0562$ from figure 5 for when friction was lowest, $a=2.008 f$ from figure 6 when friction was medium, and $a=2.0893 f - 0.064$ from figure 7 when friction was highest. each model was derived from its respective graph by graphing acceleration vs hanging force when the mass of the system was kept constant at 0.4549 kg and the friction was changed between each experiment as described above. during these experiments, the hanging force was changed in the same manner as the first experiment from lab 5, but the new control variable, friction, was added as well. the a in each model is representative of the system’s acceleration, and the f in each model is representative of the hanging force. these quantities are variables because the acceleration of the system (dv) changes with respect to the hanging force (iv). c1 in each model should be reasonably close to 1/system mass which is 2.198, and it is close for each experiment. c2 should be representative of the friction force as previously discussed, and it should increase as the controlled friction increases. this trend is observed as the value for c2 increased from -0.0182 in figure 5, to -0..03 in figure 6, to - 0.0643 in figure 7. these values are all negative because the force of friction acts in the direction opposite motion. 
random errors include the limitations involved with using the photogate, specifically in lab 05. because the system weight used in lab 05 was so large, and the system accelerated so quickly as a result, we often had to stop the graphing system and the cart before it hit the end of the track so as not to break it. this took multiple attempts, a great deal of time, and overall data that wasn’t as accurate as the photo could could have allowed. this error was minimized in lab 06 by using a much lower system mass so the cart could go to the end of the track resulting in smooth and accurate data collected for each experiment. another random error that could have been present in lab 6 was not placing the magnets symmetrically on each side on the cart, possibly affecting the force of kinetic friction felt by the cart and changing the c2 values in the mathematical models in lab 6. this could be remedied by careful and deliberate placement of the magnets in each experiment. however, because the magnets stayed the same through each trial in the given experiment, this error is somewhat systematic because it would have affected the kinetic friction in the same way for each trial in that experiment. 

	constraints of the experiment include the limited range of masses available to manipulate the hanging force and system mass. because we were limited to bobbers that weighed 4.9 grams each, results are only generalizable to systems with total masses within the ranges tested, and systems with hanging forces within the range tested. friction was also not tested in a quantifiable way as all we did was add magnets to the cart to manipulate friction, but no values for friction were calculated outside of the c2 value given by the linear fit from the graph. thus the only claim that can be made in is relation to adding or taking away from the friction force, not making it a quantifiable value that affects the mathematical model. 

	newton’s second law states that $f = m_{system} a$. the first mathematical model, $a=0.9699 f - 0.2527$, from figure 2, is consistent with newton’s second law because as previously discussed. the 0.9699 is consistent with 1/system mass and 0.2527 is another force acting on the system. thus, this model is $a = \frac{f_{hanging}}{m_{sys}}+ f_{friction}$. when further manipulated, we get $a m_{system}= f_{hanging} +f_{friction}$. because hanging force and force of friction are sum of forces acting on the system, this model is exactly newton’s law for this real-world system rearranged. the second mathematical model $a=0.0585 m$ from figure 4 is consistent with newton’s second law because as previously discussed, 0.05 is consistent with the hanging force on the system. so essentially this mathematical model is saying $a=\frac{f}{m}$, which rearranged, gives $f=m_{system} a$, which is exactly newton’s second law. thus, both mathematical models from lab 05 are consistent with newton’s second law.
