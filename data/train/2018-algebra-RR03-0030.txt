discussion and conclusion

 

	the research question being investigated was, “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?” three experiments were conducted with each identifying a different independent variable that could have an effect on the period of a pendulum. the independent variables were string length, bob mass, and angle of release. for identifying the effect of bob mass on the period of a pendulum, tables 1 and 6, and graph 1 represent the data. because there is no relationship between two variables, the initial hypothesis and prediction for the effect of bob mass on the period of a pendulum was wrong. random and systematic errors are at fault for the data represented in tables 6 and graph 1. for identifying the effect of string length on the period of a pendulum, tables 2, 7, 9, 10, and graphs 2, 4, and 5 represent the data. to reduce random error, table 9 and graph 4 show the repeated trials that were conducted to improve accuracy. to create a mathematical model, table 10 and graph 5 show the data that was gathered when using the photogate tool rather than a stopwatch. the only variable with a true effect on the period of a pendulum was string length. this is shown in graphs 2, 4, and 5. it can be seen that this is the only variable that had an effect on the period of a pendulum because each graph shows that a longer string length creates a longer period. the data for identifying the effect of angle release on the period of a pendulum is shown in tables 3 and 8, and graph 3. in table 3, the hypothesis and prediction were wrong, as shown in graph 3. in graph 3, it can be seen that as the angle of release increases, there is a lack of change in the period of the pendulum. a power function curve was used in order to best suit that data because it had an  value close to 1 (0.9961).       $y=0.2 x^{0.5}$        was the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum. this is in agreement with the found mathematical model        $y=0.1783 x^{0.5224}$             in graph 5. in the experiments that were conducted, both random and systematic errors occurred. one random error was that during the experiment, two people took time measurements of the period using a stopwatch, but they were not pressing the start/stop buttons simultaneously. another random error was that the angle of release wasn’t identical to the other angles in each trial. the measurements of the string length may have been skewed as well. the period of a pendulum itself could have been affected by random error due to how accurately it was grabbed when starting/stopping a period. multiple trials were conducted to reduce random error. using the equation , a standard deviation could be calculated. the degree of uncertainty was 0.06827. systematic errors in this experiment were regarding the triple beam balance because it read too high or too low. another systematic error was a possible shift in string length which would alter the accuracy of the measurements that were taken, and affect pendulum period. lastly, using two different brands of stopwatches is also a systematic error that occurred because the two stopwatches were recording differing values. testing and calibrating equipment before conducting experiments can reduce systematic error significantly. the main constraint on this experiment is the lack of environmental factors that could skew data in a real world setting in contrast to the controlled setting within the lab.
