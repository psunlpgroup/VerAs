discussion and conclusion: 

how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? we discovered that as the applied force increases, the acceleration also increases. this proves our prediction as correct when using our testable hypothesis for the experiment. given the liner relationship within graph 1, we can see that as the weight increases, the acceleration increases. there is no horizontal line that can be drawn through the error bars, further proving the linear relationship. using the data provided from groups 3&4, we are able to see that the increase in applied force increases the acceleration. the equations given from data studio for all groups are similar enough to give us the same results. groups 3 & 4 performed 5 trials, while our group performed 8. this was to help reduce any random error in our experimental process. for our second experiment, we were able to use the theoretical equation $f=m_{system} a$ to derive an experimental mathematical model $a=m x+b$ that illustrates the relationship between the acceleration of a system and the change in applied force. by using the enhanced theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ we can see that the force due to gravity and the force due to the mass of the hanging weight are needed for an accurate calculation of the desired acceleration. if we had an experiment with a heavy string instead of a weightless string, the acceleration would increase faster, due to the increasing weight that is being added as the string goes through the pully system and is effected by gravity. this would make calculating the acceleration difficult because as the string goes through the pully system, it is changing the mass of the hanging weight. by constraining the experiment to have a weightless string, or a very light one that has no impact on the weight of the system, we are able to keep the calculations simple.
