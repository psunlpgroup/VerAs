discussion and conclusion



	the purpose of this lab of seeing how acceleration changes when applied force changes. this was accomplished by changing the independent variable hanging mass, which changes the applied force (n). as the applied force increased, the dependent variable, the acceleration of the system (m/s^2), increased also. the data in table two and the graph in figure one clearly show that there is a linear relationship between force applied and acceleration. as force increases, the acceleration increases proportionally. in figure 1, the graph has error bars that are too small to see, therefore the uncertainty is small enough to be ignored. 

	data from other groups was compared, in table 3 (group 2 in lab 1051-019) and figure 2 (group 2 in 1051-017) the results were very similar with a few discrepancies in a few trials from the data in table 2. the only difference between the data obtained in table 2 and the other groups is that the y-intercept is negative when ours is positive (0.0179). this could have happened since our data is a little larger at within different trials. another discrepancy between our data and other groups is the slope. in figure 2, it appears that group left their independent value as mass, which made their slope decrease to 0.501. our slope was 4.5242 since we converted it to the force of the hanging mass (n). the data in table 3 had a very similar slope which was 4.831. therefore, both groups also had a linear relationship between their force/mass and acceleration. it can be concluded that as force (n) increases, the acceleration of the system (m/s^2) also increases. 

	the theoretical equation given is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. a is acceleration, which is in m/s^2. f is force of the hanging mass, which is in n. this equation could be put into $y=m x+b$ format. x is equal to force, m is equal to the slope of our graph, and b is equal to the y-intercept of our graph. when the data recorded in our trials were plugged in, the acceleration was very similar to what we received. the differences between both acceleration values is so minimal that the theoretical model does support our results. the enhanced theoretical equation given was $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. . the experimental mathematical model that can be used is the slope-intercept form equation stated above. when plugging in the values received, they differ by a minimal amount, showing that the experimental model supports the theoretical model. the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model in both the slope and the y-intercept. the slope is equal to 1kg/sum of the masses and the y-intercept is equal to 1kg/sum of the masses Ã— applied force.

	random errors that can affect this experiment is the uncertainty of the scale that was used to weigh the system and the bobbers. the scale was not electronic, which could cause some discrepancy in the weights. this error could be eliminated by taking multiple measurements and taking an average and using that average as the weight. air resistance, friction, and tension in the rope are very minimal, but need to be considered as random errors because they do affect the acceleration. there is no way to eliminate the friction and air resistance anymore in this experiment. the uncertainty of the sensor, which is measuring the acceleration is a systematic error that can be accounted for. taking more measurements for each trial could eliminate this error, but due to the lack of time in this experiment that is not possible. that is an example of a constraint in this experiment, but there are a couple more. another constraint is the small space to conduct the experiment. if there was a larger experimental setup, there could be more accurate results. also, more weight could be added if the system was larger giving a larger range of data. 

	therefore, this lab concludes that as force (n) increases, the acceleration (m/s^2) also does, and our prediction of that was correct.
