discussion and conclusion:



the purpose of this experiment was to discover if the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. after conducting experiment 1, the hanging mass as the independent variable best  addressed the research question because we were able to observe that as the mass of the hanging mass increased the acceleration of the system increased as well. we can conclude that as the force applied (with no friction) increases, the acceleration of the system increases as well. this can be stated because the hanging mass was the only force being applied to the system. so it was determined that hanging mass vs the acceleration are directly proportional. in the first experiment the graph clearly illustrates the positive relationship between the hanging mass vs the acceleration with the error bars being too small to be seen on the graph itself. with the theoretical model of a single force being ( $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, ) a clear correlation was seen with the mathematical model ( $a=c1 w+c2$). after conducting the experiment it can be stated that the theoretical model supports the mathematical model because when we plug our data into the mathematical model to get ( $a=0.048 f-0.0679$) we were able to use our mathematical model. when we were trying to find the hanging mass for a new system mass, all we had to do was plug in the acceleration into our experimental model and we were able to find the correct hanging mass that would give us the correct acceleration. it can be concluded that the mathematical model is supported by the theoretical model because the same mass will be given when a certain acceleration is plugged into either equation. even the theoretical equation for multiple forces supports our experimental model because when you plug our data into the multiple force equation ($a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ ) you will get the original single force equation because friction was negligible in this experiment which will make fext to be zero. which again, will give us the original theoretical model for a single force which we already discussed supported our mathematical model.  
the results of group 3 and 6, as presented here, support our findings. frictional forces and air resistance may show up in the mathematical and experimental models in the form of the multiplier of f. the mass in the experimental model is represented in the system and is moved around as parts of the system mass are put onto the string and used as hanging mass. a non-massless string wouldnâ€™t really affect the acceleration because the mass of the string was factored into the system mass. there would be a slight difference in the mass of the system which could make the acceleration slightly greater. random error could come when reading the balance and the starting distance of the sled. systematic error could come from the balance being calibrated and the computer program we used to measure and assemble the velocity, acceleration, and uncertainty data.
