discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this experiment was to determine if there was a correlation between the period of a pendulum swing and any of the dependent variables of the length of the pendulum, the starting angle of the pendulum swing, and the mass of the weight attached to the pendulum. a strong correlation was found between the period of the pendulum swing and the length of the pendulum producing a linear trendline with a slope of .0.104 and an r^2 value of .9572 (figure 3).

the theoretical mathematical model states that $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, where t is the period of the pendulum in seconds, l is the length of the string in meters, and g is 9.8 m/s^2. when rearranging this data so that it matches the $y=\sqrt{x}$ formula for our graph, the mathematical model becomes is  $t=2.01 l^{0.5}$. the equation for the trendline that represents our data is $t=1.9679 x^{0.5432}$, which is very close to the mathematical model because 1.9679 rounds to 2 and 0.5432 rounds to 0.5.

the error bars never overlap over the same area indicating that each data point is significant and not result of overlapping ranges of uncertainty. we used the value of 0.001 seconds as the scale error of the photogate because the measurements of the length of the pendulum swing stayed the same when conducting measurements, and no factors that would contribute to error that would compromise the experiment were observed. some examples are the pendulum not swinging in a straight path and lack of precision with measurement techniques. random errors were taken into account by the photogate because it computed an average of the period of the pendulum. 

systematic errors may include the photogate not being calibrated correctly or consistently measuring the length of the string above or below the expected values. another systematic error could have been that the scale used to measure the weight attached to the pendulum was not “calibrated” correctly because its components were worn resulting in values consistently being above or below the desired range. however, we made our best effort to be precise in our measurements of length of string and angle of release to reduce these errors. this proved to be beneficial because the data points fit within the trendline very well, with an r^2 value of 0.999 (figure 4).
