conclusions: 

the research question was what variables effect the period of a pendulum. the result of the data from the first experiment was very inconclusive. trials with mass as the independent variable resulted in data which had no noticeable difference after accounting for the data bars. this leads the data to disprove any connection between mass and the period. in the experiment, the trials which used angle and string length had a slight if noticeable correlation to the period of the pendulum. error bars still suggested such a conclusion is question able. in the second experiment, better tools lead to better results. these results lead to the proof that it can be reasonably assumed that angle has no effect on period while the length of the string has a noticeable difference. in the case of angle, error bars still showed after very precise measurement while the tests on length made the error bars too small to see. based on the equations we derived from the final trial, the mathematical model for the equation of the period of the pendulum is $p=2.1089 l^{0.4536}$. the theoretical model shows that the correct formula is         $t=2.007 l^{0.5}$      this result is close to the result we derived. since gravity is assumed a constant, the results we calculated ignores the interaction of gravity and assumes it to be constant. the true theoretical equation is . our results were also compared with the results of other groups to validate this conclusion. the error faced in the first experiment was mainly random error. most of this came from the setup of the experiment which resulted in human reaction time to get accurate timekeeping. this caused a large value for Ïƒ. this greatly obscured our results. if our error was smaller, we could have ruled out angle as variable that had a result on the period in the first experiment. the second experiment had much smaller error. it used an automated timing system which reduced the random error in the first experiment. the constraints were the weight, which only had increments of 25 grams and had a max weight, the string, which had a max length, location, which ensured we could only test gravity at one value, and the timing systems, which limited the accuracy of the data.
