discussion and conclusion:

the question in experiments one and two were to form a model for the relationships between acceleration and mass and force and mass. experiments three four and five investigate the effect of friction on the experimental results. from the first two experiments, we concluded that the model for force, acceleration, and mass looked something like this is  $a Â =2.8681 m_{hanging}+ 0.032$ and $a = 0.0003 m_{system} + 0.027$. knowing the theoretical value $f=m a$, we can conclude that the constant in front of force in the first model and mass in the second model represent 1/mass and 1/force respectively. the model of the other group we looked at disagreed with the constant in our first model and the linear layout of our second, but based on the models from lab 06 it would appear it was more likely their error and not ours. based on our results from experiments three through five, as friction increased, the constants decreased. this would lead me to believe that the first constant is 1/mass since it decreased as we increased the mass. the magnitude of the second constant increased with each experiment, so it likely corresponds to the unknown forces acting on the system, such as friction, the force we investigated. as friction increased, the magnitude of the constant increased as well. the repeatability of these results depends on a lot of factors, so these exact numbers are probably not generally applicable to other experiments in other settings, but the theory applies across all settings. increasing friction should decrease the second constant while increasing it in magnitude, and an increase in mass should decrease the first constant. the theoretical equation resulting from these experiments would be is  $a =\frac{m_{hanging}}{m_{sys}} + f_{unknown}$. if the string pulling the cart was heavy, the force of the string due to gravity as it went around the wheel and was put into a position where it could pull the rest of the system would cause acceleration to increase as the cart moved. this would skew results, and occurred in our experiment as well on a small scale. th random error from this experiment was very small and was reported by the computer program used to measure the speed of the cart. the other error added was the random distance off the cart was from exactly 1 meter during the last 3 experiments. these two numbers were very small, however, and did not add error bars large enough to see in any of the graphs.
