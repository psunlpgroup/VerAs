conclusion:
the research question for this lab is, what impacts the period of a pendulum? the mass experiment related to the research question by finding the relationship between the two. we claimed that the mass at the end of a pendulum had no effect on the period of the pendulum. this claim is backed up by our mass v avg period gragh, which had a slope of zero. the angle of release experiment related to the research question by finding the relationship between the two. we claimed that the angle of release of the pendulum arm had no effect on the period of the pendulum. this claim is backed up by our angle v avg period gragh, which also had a slope of zero. the length of string experiment related to the research question by being the only iv that actualy effected the period. we claimed that as the string length increased as did the period. this claim is backed up by the string length v avg period grapgh having a linear and positive slope. the theoretical mathematical model for the period states that            $y=0.0112 x + 1.001$         y being the period in seconds and x being the length of the string. this model does not include variable for mass or angle of release as they do not make a difference in the period. the only error real error in this experiment was a random error. this was the human error when using the stop watch to record the period. this error was reduced by later using a photogate.
