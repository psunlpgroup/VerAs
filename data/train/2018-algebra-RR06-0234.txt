The research question as listed above in table 1, was how will the acceleration of a system change as the applied force is altered? As the hanging mass of the system was changed it can be noticed in graph 1. Shown above that the acceleration changed as well. As the hanging force (IV) was increased the acceleration increased and shows a positive correlation in the graph. Error bars are represented in the graph but are too little to be noticed. 
As shown above in table 3 and 4, it can be noticed that as the hanging mass was increased the acceleration increased as well. Groups 4 and 6â€™s data validates our hypothesis which states that the acceleration will increase as the hanging force increases. 
The theoretical equation is $f=m_{sys} a$. The mathematical model is $y=0.0051 x-0.0173$, with an R^2 value of 0.9978. This model makes sense with graph 1 shown above because the data is linear, and we obtained a high R^2 value. Therefore, the theoretical model is supported. 
If the string connecting the hanging mass to the cart was noticeably heavy, the results would not differ as long as the mass of the string was accounted for as part of the system. Similar results would be obtained that would still validate our hypothesis that the acceleration would increase as the hanging force was increased. 
Errors made during the completion of this experiment could be due to, adding extra force when releasing the cart, or resisting the cart upon release. In order to improve this error a quick release system could be added to reduce the amount of force possibly being exerted on the cart by a human. Constraints could include not accounting for friction (although friction should be negligible due to the frictionless air track used during the experiment).
