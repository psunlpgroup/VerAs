discussion and conclusion:

	the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models which describe how the acceleration of a system is impacted as the force applied to the system is varied and as the mass of the system is varied. this lab is also intended to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value in the models found in lab 05. in the first experiment in lab 05, investigating how the applied force impacted the acceleration of the system, we kept the mass of the system and increased the hanging mass for each trial. this data produced a plot of applied force vs. acceleration and the mathematical model of $a=3.3461 f + 0.0277$. this model is representative of newton’s second law of motion, $f = m a$, when solved for acceleration, $a =\frac{f}{m}$.  this graph is linear because the acceleration varies directly with the applied force when mass is constant. the value 3.3461 represents the value of 1/m and 0.0277 represents the acceleration of the system if the applied force was equal to zero. the value 0.0277 is not zero due to experimental error that could include a slight tilt in the air track so that the cart would move in the positive direction when no force was applied to it. the second experiment in lab 05, investigating the impact of the mass of the system on the acceleration, was completed by keeping the applied force constant and slowly increasing the mass of the system. the mathematical model obtained from this experiment was $a = 0.0406  m^{1.115}$. this model is also representative of newton’s second law when solved for acceleration, $a =\frac{f}{m}$. the value 0.0406 represents the constant force applied to the system and m^(-1.115) represents the 1/m value. this mathematical model is achieved by creating a graph of mass vs. acceleration in the form of a power curve since the variable, m, is intended to be raised to the -1st power. lab 06 investigated the impact of friction on the acceleration of the system as well as the values in the mathematical model obtained in lab 05. the models for lab 06 are $y = 3.5469 x - 0.0369$ for the 346.6g mass, $y= 2.7673 x - 0.0458$ for the 411.33g mass, and                  $y = 2.2774 x-0.0476$ for the 495.84g mass. all of these models are representative of newton’s second law in the form of $a =\frac{f}{m}$ where the mass is held constant and the force is varied. the slope of the graphs decrease as the mass of the system increases because the slope is representative of the value of 1/m which gets smaller as the mass gets larger. also, the y-intercept of the models decreases as the mass increases because the y-intercept represents the force of friction acting on the system and as the mass increases, the normal force and the friction force between the cart and the air track increase. the mathematical models presented by group #6 in lab 06 reinforce the claim that the slope and y-intercept of the equation decrease as the mass of the system increases. the mathematical models determined by group #3 introduce a new variable that could affect the values in the mathematical models determined. group #3 investigated a tilt in the air track, making the cart travel on a slight incline. as the slope of the incline increased, the slope of the equation remained nearly constant and the y-intercept decreased. the slope remained constant because the mass of the system remained constant and the y-intercept of the equation decreased because the force exerted by gravity in the negative x direction or down the incline increased. in lab 06, the only factor that my group tested was the impact of friction on the mathematical model. our experiment could have also been impacted by some incline or decline in the air track that would have affected the y-intercept of the mathematical models obtained. other errors that could have impacted the data and mathematical models determined include the accuracy of the pulley that measures the acceleration, slippage between the string and the pulley, and human error in measurements. any possible slippage between the pulley and the string was prevented by making sure that the string only touched the pulley, the cart, and the hanging mass and no knots were present in the string. any human error could be reduced by completing more trials to reduce the amount of random error present. for lab 05, the small range of masses tested and the small distance the cart traveled affect the generalizability of the results to all systems with larger masses and distances covered. for lab 06, the lack of a large number of trials leads to a lower confidence in applying the results to other situations.
