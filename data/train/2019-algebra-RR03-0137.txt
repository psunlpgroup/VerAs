conclusion:

the research question being investigated was what impacts the peroid of a pendulum for small swings. each of the three experiments looked at different variables that could possibly affect the swing time, with each of the three experiments it helped eliminate the variables that did not affect the period of the swing. when we found the mathematical model, we found the trendline to be 2.0974x^.4242. our data fit the model well. we also found that the other groups in the class got roughly the same data. we found that the only variable to affect the pendulum swing was the length of the string. one of the biggest errs that was present was the human factor of using the stopwatch, to correct for this we used the photogate, this measured the exact time of the period. lastly the constraints we had was that our data only describes the time of the period, we did not do research about the height of the swing or if a string with more stretch in it would give different results.
