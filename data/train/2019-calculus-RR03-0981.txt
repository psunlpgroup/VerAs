conclusion:
 the question for all of this is what impacts the period of a pendulum, and more particularly for smaller swinging angles. for the first one, length of the string was made the independent variable. the thought process was that a longer string meant a longer x distance and there for increasing the period. after the experiment, the graph shows an increasing slope which supports the claim. for experiment two, the angle of release was set to the independent variable and was thought to increase the period. the graph does elude to that, but with the error bars, there is chance there is no correlation here. for experiment three, mass was made the independent variable and was thought to not change the period. this was thought because everything falls at the same speed. the graph shows a straight flat line supporting the claim.

	  the mathematical model for the graph for the change in length of the string was $y=0.123186 x$ compared to the theoretical model which is $t=2 pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$. our values were close to the theoretical ones, and the trendline was a nice fit with an r-squared is 0.9984. for the second experiment, the equation of the line was supposed to be a straight flat line with no slope, the graphed data had an equation of $y=1.594 - 0.0099 x$ with an r squared value of rsquared is 0.7471. this was due to error. in experiment three, the equation of our line was $y = 9 e^{-0.5} x + 1.1591$ with an r squared value of rsquared is  0.0018. the theoretical mathematical model was supposed to be a straight flat line with a slope of zero.

	most of our error was random error due to the human error, like reaction time. there was error with our experiments two and three. for exp. two our tower shifted multiple times leading to different angles and incorrect period. another factor that changed multiple things was that our length was in centimeters rather than meters. errors were reduced in the end by using a photogate. the constraints were that not everyone got the same results although using the same procedure. mostly due to human error.
