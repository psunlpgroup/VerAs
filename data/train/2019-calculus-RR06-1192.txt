discussion and conclusion:



the purpose of lab 5 was to develop models to show the behavior of an actual system. in this case, the system contained a hanging mass, a pulley and a frictionless surface. the model that was attempting to explain this system was force equals mass times acceleration or more precisely acceleration is force divided by mass. the two factors that were explored were changing the mass of the hanging mass and changing the normal force of mass one. 

the purpose of lab 6 was to explain all parts of the general linear equation for $a =\frac{f}}{m}$ or c1 x+c2. in this case, we explored different slopes to determine what c2 in the equation meant as c1 (1/m) was found in lab 5.



$a = 2.87 f - 0.015$,  $a = 4.58 m^{-1.113}$, $a  = 2.83 f$, $a = 2.816 f - 0.022$ (orange), and $a = 2.75 f -0.04$ (grey). the first two experiments centered around the equation $f=m a$. from this, two factors were explored. these being changes in hanging mass and additional normal force. in figure 1, hanging mass vs acceleration was explored. we determined a linear fit for the data. this makes sense because the mass of the system is held constant, resulting in the linear equal $a= \frac{f}{m}$ where m is constant. this was determined by looking at the graph and comparing r^2 values of different fits. the linear equation had the best fit, which helped explain the equation. this linear slope means that there is a fixed coefficient for f and f is related directly to a. the “b” for the line is due to error from possible friction and/or non level surfaces. the ‘x’ in the equation is f. the 2.87 is related to (1/m) in figure 2, normal force vs acceleration was explored. from the data plotted, a non linear fit was pretty evident as the data was curved. after comparing r^2 values, a power function was determined. this means the relationship was $a =\frac{f}{m}$ where f is constant and 1/m has a coefficient of f. although our relationship was to the -1.113 power, it looks similar to the expected m^-1. this means as m increases, the acceleration goes down inversely, which is show in the graph by its concavity. the coefficient relates to f (f  is 4.58, ‘x’ is m, and the power relations to m^-1 from the equation.

figure 3 shows multiple linear lines. similarly to figure 1, the slope of the line has a constant (1/m) and a varying f. this makes sense as we ran the experiment the same, but with different slant heights. additionally to this, the “b” value is related to the slope of the frictionless track. a more steep decline equals a more negative y-intercept as each line was lower than the one with a less steep slope. f is 2.83, 2.81, and 2.75. the y intercepts are the steepness of the slope.



one systematic error could be an uneven frictionless surface. if it is not level, inaccurate data could be found. based on our data, if the slope was a decline, the object would accelerate slower and if there is an incline, the object would accelerate faster. this could be fixed if a level was used. another error would be air resistance. due to how the experiment was set up, air resistance was unavoidable. a random or human error could be inconsistent start distances. if this value was less, the acceleration could be less as the distance the object had to travel would be less and an inaccurate reading could be found. this could be fixed by using a consistent location based in mm. another random error would be not maintaining a perfect mass system. if you assume all bobbers had the same mass, you would find an incorrect total mass (most likely too little mass). this could be fixed by finding the mass of every bobber. 



one constraint is the overly generalized system. there would be air resistance felt by both the hanging mass and the “frictionless” mass. on top of this, the air beam was not truly frictionless, and most likely would still cause some friction or it was overly “frictionless” and pushed the object along (most likely from a slant). this could not necessarily be reduced. we also assumed the pulley was ideal, which it most likely is not. this could be fixed by using different pulleys and averaging the lab’s results/ removing outliers. another constraint would be that this force system attempts to only use gravity as a force and ignores all other forces. this means that the actual gravitational force and the experimental gravitational force could be different (friction etc.). the string was not massless. 


graph 1 is consistent with this formula because the slope of the line is linear. if you change the hanging mass, but allow a varying force due to this change, a linear equation or model would be found. this is due to a known force being used. this means a is a constant (1/m) * a varying f based on mass. graph 2 is consistent with this formula as the slope of the line is nearly an inverse relationship. this is because a known f is used. this is due to knowing that an increase in normal force causes a change in mass of the system or, more simply, by changing a known force, (1/m) is found to be varying with acceleration indirectly. 

if a heavy string is used, the acceleration would most likely start slowly and then accelerate faster as more string dangled. i believe this because the mass will first work against the hanging mass until enough of it moved to dangle more mass away from the frictionless mass.
