	the task of this lab was test three variables that could have an affect on the period of a pendulum. the three variables where length of rope, mass of bob, and angle of drop. for our first test, angle of release, we can conclude that it has no effect on the period. the results show in the first graph that the period didnâ€™t break the uncertainty range, and that there was no relationship in time. this proved there was no correlation. for our second test, mass of bob, we concluded that it had no affect on the period either. the second graph shows there was again no relationship in time and no break in the uncertainty range. the third experiment however did yield results. as you can see in the third graph, the change in the length of the rope proved to break the uncertainty range in the period. the curve also shows it had a sensible relationship in increasing of time. our theoretical equation of $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ was used to predict the actual time our periods should take. with this we found our experiments have systematic error. we worked on reducing this by using a laser stop watch and using the same person to drop the mass. this did not completely fix our results but made them more accurate. being able to do all three tests in a single sitting will likely improve results for any others trying to recreate our results. because of our split times equipment could have gotten damaged or gotten different equipment during the between time.
