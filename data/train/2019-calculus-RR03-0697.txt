conclusion



the only factor that determines the period of its pendulum is the length of its string. weight and angle of release are not related to the period. 

the data in the charts supports the claim because the only factor that correlated to the period is length of the string. 

other possible factors include inaccurate data due to not being able to tell the exact completion of a period. releasing the pendulum at the wrong angle due to a protractor being a questionable tool for this experiment could also be a factor. 

improvements could include using a better tool to measure degrees and using the white board to help measure the period.
