discussion and conclusion

when conducting an experiment where time is involved, it is very hard to eliminate human error. however, it is possible to reduce these errors. the average time of period for the pendulum was taken instead of trying to time one simple swing. we also set up an apparatus to measure the time. the research question is  what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings, was answered using the data. we can conclude from this data that the period of a pendulum is not effected by the angle and mass, however the length of string will have a direct relationship with the period of a pendulum.
