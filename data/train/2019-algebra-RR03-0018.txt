conclusion:
In this lab we had the goal to find what Independent Variable (Mass, String Length, or Angle) affected the period of the pendulum. The different experiments were related to each of the Independent Variables. We did numerous trials of each of the experiments, so we knew we had an accurate representation of the data collected. Originally my group thought that all the Independent Variables had a direct correlation to the period of the pendulum but after further research we realized that the Mass and the Angle of release had some affect, but it wasn’t a large enough change in period. The theoretical mathematical model for the period is        $t=2.0071 L^{0.5}$            This is very similar to what we collected from our data as we collected       $t=2.1251 L^{0.4727}$          with an R^2 of 0.9998. While we were testing the affect of the String Length on the period of the pendulum, we kept the mass of the pendulum and tried our best to keep the angle of release of the pendulum constant. As we may have varied the angle by a very small amount it didn’t skew our research as we were still very close to the theoretical mathematical model and had the best R^2 value we saw among our class. Most of the Possible Random errors we could have came across during our first trials were practically eliminated as we used the photogate to measure the period of the pendulum which is accurate to the 0.001 of a second. Some of the systematic that could have ben present would all be related to our measurement tools which still aren’t perfect, but we tried our best to be as accurate as possible measuring twice during each stage of the trials. The only real constraint is that we could have more ran more trials and gotten more data to make our graph and evaluations more accurate.
