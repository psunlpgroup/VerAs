discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to confirm newton’s first and second law by testing the impact of force on the acceleration of a system.  the set up of the experiment helps determine the research question by using a cart with hanging bobbers, the independent variable, and a frictionless air track to test the effect of applying gravitational force to the system. the hanging mass was added by connecting fishing bobbers to the end of a string attached to the cart and a pulley that measures the acceleration of the system.  

the results of the lab are shown in graph 1. as you can see as the mass of the hanging mass increases, so does the acceleration, which verifies newton’s law. on this graph the error bars were too small to be seen due to the high level of precision this lab was completed with.

during class, the chance to study other data from various groups was presented. after looking at two groups, it was concluded that very similar results were accomplished. as the hanging mass of the system increases, so does the acceleration. all three groups have very similar experimental design templates and also the data was consistent throughout all three experiments.  

the mathematical model found in the experiment, $y=c1 x+c2$ , when c2 is 0 it relates to the theoretical model, $a= \frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ . the force for the theoretical equation is the theoretical equation is $y=\frac{f_{applied}+f_{friction}}{m_{sys}}$ which works out (hanging mass*9.8m/s^2)/(1000) which is 0.04753 n for trial 1 and the mass of the system is 0.18886 kg. to find the theoretical acceleration value you do $a= 0.04753 0.18886$ so $a= 0.252$ m/s^2. this is different from our experimental acceleration value for trial 1 as that was 0.210. the experimental acceleration value differed from the theoretical acceleration value by 0.042 m/s^2 when only one force is accounted for.  

using these two models, it can be predicted that if a heavier string were used, the acceleration of the system would increase proportionally compared to the fishing line. the heavier string would add a consistent weight to the system impacting the acceleration.

in this lab, random error is that the bobbers or the system could have been measured inaccurately because the spring scale used was manual and not digital. this would have caused measurements to be off by various numbers making them inconsistent. systematic errors could have been from using a old scale that is worn out resulting in the weights on the scale to be an inaccurate mass. another systematic error could have been datastudio could not be calibrated properly causing in incorrect velocity values. the random error was reduced by weighing each hanging mass by removing bobbers from the cart to the hanging end of the string. both having new equipment and making sure the datastudio has recently and correctly been calibrated could solve the systematic errors. 

     constraints on this lab were not having enough time to do more trials to achieve positive and consistent data. additionally, the supplies given to us in order to weigh the system, bobbers, and paperclips, causing a limited relationship to be determined, limited the lab. 

other forces to consider that may have impacted the experimental model are air resistance. the mass of the system plays the role of the control variable in the experiment, therefore remains constant and does not affect the outcome of the experiment. while these errors do impact the experiment, it is so miniscule that the results of the experiment are still valid.
