discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of part i of the lab was to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system.  we analyzed how mass of bobs and the mass of the system affect acceleration.  for part ii, we developed an understanding of how applied force and friction changed the constants in the mathematical models.
in order to find the mathematical models, we added the data to excel and plotted each set in graphs.  we then created trendlines and converted them into mathematical models.   
newton’s second law if $f=m a $.  for the first experiment, this is shown in our mathematical model, $a = 2.8514 f - 0.0111$(m/s^2).  2.18514(kg^-1) represents the mass of the system inversed, which will cancel out with the independent variable of ‘f’ to get m/s^2.  the value of -0.0111(m/s^2) is due to a random outside force acting on the system, possibly friction.  graph 1 supports our model due to the fact that it shows that as the force applied, increases the acceleration of the system increases.
for the second experiment, we analyzed how the mass of the system affects acceleration.  our mathematical model is $a = 0.0767 m^{-1.096}$.  the constant force applied to the system is represented 0.0767(n)  the mass is the independent variable and   raised to the -1.096 to match newton’s second law.  graph 2 supports this conclusion by showing the inverse relationship for mass of the system and acceleration with a negative to show that as the mass of the system increases, the acceleration of the system decreases proportionally.
for the third experiment, we tested for the outside force that was discovered in experiment 1.  we tested to find out the force by putting extra mass on the cart in different places to determine if  friction would alter the mathematical models.  this gave us three mathematical models is  $a = 1.7941 f + 0.0194$ (m/s^2), $a = 1.8971 f - 0.0584$(m/s^2), and $a = 1.8322 f - 0.0078$ (m/s^2).  the first equation does not assist us due to the fact that it doesn’t match the equation found in experiment 1. the graphs match experiment 1 since they show that as the force increased, acceleration of the system also increased.



this group analyzed how applied force affects acceleration.  however based upon their whiteboard, the data is inconclusive.  they did not include a claim, which does not allow us to compare our claim/data with theirs.  however, their equations are fairly close to ours.  the differences may be due to the total mass of the system since they did not include the total mass of their system on their whiteboard we can’t draw any comparisons.  their mathematical models help allow us to better understand that acceleration is equal to force subtracted by a relative friction constant. 
group 1’s hypothesis was that the slant of the track affects the overall acceleration.  they concluded that when the height is elevated on the side of the pulley, the acceleration increases.  this is supported by the fact that positive heights have a greater slope than a negative height.  group 1’s iv had a larger impact that our group’s iv due to the fact that their slope is much larger than ours.  one of this group’s mathematical models was $a = 0.3475 f + 0.0006$.  this shows that acceleration is equal to a constant multiplied by the force plus a friction constant.
a systematic error in our experiments was in weighing the masses on the scale.  since larry measured the masses each time, it is possible that he concluded that the masses weighed more than they actually did, or less than they actually did, during every trial.  this would move the overall distribution of the masses in a certain direction.

constraints in the experiment included the length of the fishing line and the impossibility of removing all friction on the track.  since the fishing line only had a certain length, we had to start the glider at 650 cm each time, it could not reach full acceleration with prevents us from analyzing the data over a longer length of time which would provide us with a better slope.  also, there is still friction on the track since the system is not in a vacuum.  thus, the amount of friction working against the glider did not remain constant during every trial.
newton’s second law is $f = m a$.  for our first mathematical model is  $a = 2.8514 f -0.0111$ (m/s^2), 2.18514(kg^-1) represents the mass of the system inversed, which will cancel out with the independent variable of ‘f’ to get m/s^2.  the value of -0.0111(m/s^2) is due to a random outside force acting on the system, possibly friction.
for our second mathematical model is  $a = 0.0767 m^{-1.096}$.  the constant force applied to the system is represented 0.0767(n)  the mass is the independent variable and   raised to the -1.096 to match newton’s second law.  graph 2 supports this conclusion by showing the inverse relationship for mass of the system and acceleration with a negative to show that as the mass of the system increases, the acceleration of the system decreases proportionally.
