discussion and conclusion

	the research question that was being investigated in this experiment was what impacts the period of the pendulum.  three different independent variables were tested, length of the string, weight, and angle of release. in table 1 and figure 1, the mass of the pendulum was increased in each trial. the result showed that the mass of the pendulum did not have any substantially effect on the period of the pendulum. in table 2 and figure 2, the length of the string was increased in each trial. the results showed that the longer the string, the longer it took to complete a period. so, string length had a substantially effect on the period. in table 3 and figure 3, the angle of release was increased in each trial. the results showed that the angle did not have any substantially effect on the period. 

	since the length of the string was the only independent variable to have an effect on the period. another trial was conducted using a photogate so that human error would not have an impact. figure 4, confirmed our findings that the length of the string had an impact on the period of the pendulum. using a photogate made the ranges of uncertainty for this lab was .001

which resulted in error bars that were so small that you couldn’t even see them in the graph. the theoretical equation for this experiment was $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$,  which could be simplified to $t=c1 l^{c2}$. our experimental equation was $y= 2.0974 x^{0.42}$ which match the theoretical equation and lead to our claim because we found out that our graph was nonlinear and it showed a power function trend line. 

	there were many random and systemic errors that occur in this lab. a random error in this experiment was using a stopwatch. using a stopwatch is prone to have errors due to the person’s reflexes and how quick they can hit the stop button. to reduce the random error, many trials were conducted and the averages were taken. a systemic error could have been the pendulum weights were not accurate due to wear and tear. a way to reduce this error is to get new weights to ensure accuracy. time was the only thing that limited our results. if there was more time, more trials could have been conducted which would reduce random error and give more accurate results.
