conclusion:

the purpose of the first weeks experiments were to determine the appropriate mathematical models that describe the behavior of how changing the mass of a system or the hanging mass (force) effects the acceleration. the purpose of the second weeks experiment was to determine how changing elements of the physical lab i.e. inclination, effects the variables of the mathematical models determined in the first week. 

in lab 05, the linear model was determined by altering the force, which was the mass of m2, and plotting it against the acceleration. this can be seen in data table 1, and graph 1. the mathematical model $a=-2e + 0.0029 f - 1$ with an r^2 value of 1. this means there is a positive, linear correlation between the iv, force, and dv, acceleration. the model shows the greater the force is, the larger the acceleration will be. the second experiment in lab 05 tested how acceleration changes based on the mass of the system which is illustrated in data table 2 and graph 2. it was determined that the power model was the best fit, with an equation of $a=147.39 m^{-1}$ and r^2 value of 1. the values of the mathematical model show that there is a negative correlation between the mass of the system and acceleration, meaning that is the mass of the system increases, the acceleration will decrease. in lab 06 the same experiment was repeated but with altering the physical lab setting, specifically inclination, to determine how each of the mathematical models were impacted. this can be seen in data tables 3-5, as well as graphs 3-5. the mathematical model for a one block incline was $a=0.011 f+0.1665$ with an r^2 value of 0.5418. the model for a two block incline was $a=0.019 f+0.1149$ with an r^2 value of 0.7557. the model for the one block decline was $a=0.0007 f+0.2602$ with an r^2 value of 0.6133. the models obtained in lab 06 did not align and support the results from the previous experiment, which indicates some experimental errors were involved. 
as shown on the left, group 1s mathematical model supported our hypothesis for experiment 06. it was shown that as the incline increases, the acceleration decreases. as shown on the right, group two tested a hypothesis that examined a different aspect of the physical lab setting by using magnetic bars. 

a systematic error that could have been present in the experiment could be if the balances were not calibrated which would result in all of the data being skewed in one direction. possible random error includes reading the masses incorrectly, the random errors of an experiment can be reduced by increasing the sample size and running more trials. 

the constraints of the experiment that may limit the generalizability of the results include the small sample size. in lab 05, only 5 different system masses and forces were tested and in lab 06 only 3 inclinations were tested that were all very similar to each other. adding a wider range of data would increase the generalizability of the results. 

the mathematical models from experiment 05 are consistent with newtonâ€™s second law, which states $f=m a$, which can also be rewritten as $a=\frac{f}{m}$. this shows that as force increases when mass is held constant, the acceleration should increase which was observed in graph 1. it shows that as the mass of the system increases, the acceleration should decrease, which was also observed by the mathematical model shown in graph 2.
