conclusion:
the findings of these two experiments would be that both the hanging mass and tilt would have an effect on the acceleration. As the hanging mass and tilt was increased the acceleration increased. The errors that could have been obtained by this experiment would have been the incorrect weighing of the bobbers used, the incorrect selection on the graphs to find the acceleration, or the human error of stopping the program to early or staring it too late. Constraints on this experiment were nonexistent.  The mathematical models for this experiment that follows the equation of  with (a) meaning acceleration and (F) meaning the hanging mass/factor we decided to test with the tilt. The equation from trial one is, . The equation from trial two is,   The equation from trial three is,   The equations found in lab 6 and in lab 5 corresponds with the Newtonâ€™s Second Law because the sum of the factors will equal the mass of the system times the acceleration. With two other groups in our class they came to similar conclusions as shown below.
