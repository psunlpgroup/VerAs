discussion/conclusion:

	at the end of the third lab, students successfully completed all the learning objectives and proved the testable hypothesis through error analysis and standard lab practices.  students successfully tested all the independent variables and determined which independent variables effected the period of the pendulum.  as labs progressed students identified random errors in the testing process, including reaction time of the timers, minute differences in each release angle, and the true length of the string with respect to the mass.  these errors were reduced by measuring the string after the mass was applied, increasing the number of trials to reduce the random error of the timers, and placing a visible marker as a guide to pull the mass back to achieve an ideal release angle.  by analyzing the graphs in figures 1, 2, and 3, only string length influenced the period.  this was proved using the error bars on the graphs.  although the angle of release seemed to affect the period because of the non-linear nature of the graph,  displayed overlapping, which did not give team members the confidence that the period was affected because of the independent variable but instead by random error.  although excel provided the equation of the best fit line for the trial using the photogate, this mathematical model did not match the correct theoretical equation.  the correct theoretical equation is .  students were not able to calculate this exact equation because of the gravity constant.  being in a constant gravitational field did not allow students to take into account the true gravity factor.
