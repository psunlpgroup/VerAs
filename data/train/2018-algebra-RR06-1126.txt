discussion and conclusion 

the purpose of the lab was the investigate the effects of applied force on acceleration of the system.

through the experiment, we were able to graph each applied force with its corresponding acceleration and obtain a mathematical model of $a = 4.8214 f + 0.002$ (see figure 1), where a is acceleration (m/s2) and f is applied force (n). according to this best fit line, applied force share a positive and linear relationship with acceleration. in other words, acceleration will change in the same manner (decrease or increase) as applied force, which was our prediction. in addition, the extremely small error bars serve as the indicator for the precision of the data (how close the data points are to each other).
the results from both of these groups support our experimental model, with the slope residing in the range of 4 to 5 and the y-intercept residing near 0. these results portray the existence of external forces on the system, as shown by the non-zero y-intercept. the reasoning for the different slopes (not exact) is because these groups had different total masses of the systems, as shown on their respective white boards. in addition, their starting distance is different from ours, which could influence the acceleration of the system.

the equation for the theoretical model is $a = 5.3 f$, or $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. the slope is discussed in the latter portion of this paragraph. there is no y-intercept because it is equal to f/(total mass of the system), and friction is negligible. the theoretical model is different from the experimental model in that it is a frictionless system where air resistance is not a factor and random error does not exist. in reality, there are the force of friction exerted by the air track, the force of friction exerted by the pulley, the force of friction exerted by the clamp that stations the pulley and the rotary motion detector, and the force of air resistance exerted on the hanging mass. there is also the force of friction exerted by the string, which can slow down the hanging mass as the string travels through and touches the pulley, especially if the string has considerable mass. however, when analyzing the slope of these models, we find that the mass of the system shows up in the form of the slope, which is equal to 1/(total mass of the system). with the mass of the system as 0.1885 kg, our experimental slope is 4.8214, whereas our theoretical slope is 1/0.1885 is 5.3. this value is decently close to our experimental value, given all of the external forces that the experimental model does not consider. in addition, our y-intercept is 0.002, which is close to the y-intercept from the theoretical model. this paragraph discusses the theoretical and experimental equations for the system where there is only one force. in the case of several forces acting on the system, the enhanced theoretical equation is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. the experimental model equation better reflects this enhanced theoretical equation as it takes into consideration the external forces, which exist in the experimental model, in the form of y-intercept. as previously mentioned, our y-intercept is not a perfect 0, which is an indicator for the existence of external forces. 

possible systematic errors include the incorrect calibration of the datastudio program and the incorrect calibration of the scale, which can cause the acceleration measurements to be all above or below the theoretical value. to reduce these errors, we can calibrate the program and the scale before running any trial. as far as random errors, there are not as many since itâ€™s a controlled experiment with most of the work done by precise instruments. however, we suspect that the wobbling of the mass might influence the velocity, specifically the direction, of the system. 

several constraints exist in this experiment that may limit the generalizability of the results. these include finding the exact equipment, such as the cart, the air track, bobbers and the string with an insignificant mass, to replicate the trials. in addition, it may not be able to utilize the same datastudio program, which will significantly alter the trial replications.
