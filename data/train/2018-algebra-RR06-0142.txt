discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to determine the relationship between the applied force on an object and the acceleration, and find a mathematical model between the two. the research question was is  how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? to determine this, a frictionless cart with bobs attached was used. a string was attached to the cart and connected to a pulley, from which the hanging masses were put. each trial, one bob was transferred from the cart to the hanging mass, creating a different applied force. after testing different applied forces, the resulting acceleration was recorded, as table 2 shows. the resulting acceleration was recorded using a rotary motion sensor, which created graphs on the computer screen showing the acceleration. as shown in figure 1 depicting the graph of applied force vs. acceleration, the relationship found between applied force and acceleration is a positive direct relationship. the equation found was $y=0.0042 x - 0.0221$ in which y refers to acceleration and x refers to applied force. this mathematical model makes sense, because the theoretical model is $a =\frac{f_h}{m} + \frac{f_u}{m}$. 

data was also collected from two other groups and compared to our data. picture 1 shows the data that group 1 collected. the mass of their system was 188.9g, which is very similar to the mass of my system, 187.8g. their graph also looks very similar to mine is  a straight, upward sloping line. this shows a positive relationship between the applied force and the acceleration, just like the graph of our data does. picture 2 shows the data that the monkey group collected. the mass of their system was 190.35g, also fairly close to the mass on my system, 187.8g. the monkey group’s results were also very close to the results of my group. their graph also is a straight, upward sloping line, indicating a positive direct relationship between the applied force and the acceleration. thus, both of these groups’ results support my group’s claim that the relationship between applied force and acceleration is a positive direct relationship. 

the theoretical model for the acceleration of a system by a single force is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. our experimental mathematical model $y=0.0042 x - 0.0221$ in which y is acceleration, supports the theoretical model because it takes into account the forces acting on the system, as well as the mass of the system. but, our experimental mathematical model also shows the presence of multiple forces. thus, a more enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by more than one force is needed to be used, which is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. fext represents the forces other than the hanging mass that are acting on the system. in our experimental mathematical model $y=0.0042 x - 0.0221$ 0.0221 is fext, or external force. some possible examples of this external force are friction and that the track that the cart was moving on may not have been completely flat; there might have been a very small slope to it. this would have made gravity a possible external force. the mass of the system in our experimental model shows up in both the 0.0042 and the 0.0221. these values have been divided by the mass of our system (187.8g). if a non-massless string was used to connect the hanging mass to the cart, the mass of the system would increase, which would cause the uniform acceleration of the cart to decrease, due to the higher mass. 

the biggest systematic error in this experiment was the hole in our tubing that blew air onto the track to make the cart move. for every trial, this hole was present, thus, each one of our data points was affected by this hole. in the future, tape could be used to shut the hole off to prevent air from escaping. another possible systematic error in this experiment is the track not being completely level, as mentioned above. this would have made gravity an external force and would have affected each data point taken. to fix this in the future, put an object on the track to test it to be sure that it is level. if the object does not move, the track should be level. an example of random error is if the hanging mass was swaying/moving slightly prior to the start of the start of the measurement of acceleration, which would have affected the applied force on the system. to prevent this, be sure to hold the hanging mass still before starting the trial.

one constraint in this experiment that would limit the generalizability of our results is friction. it was assumed that the track was frictionless, but friction was still present. thus, our results cannot be generalized for experiments that are truly frictionless.
