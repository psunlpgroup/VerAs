discussion/conclusion:

	what impacts the pendulum for small swings is the question being investigated in this lab. the three experiments that were investigated in this lab helped to address this research question in a variety of ways. in the first experiment, the length of the string was tested to see whether different lengths of the string would affect the period of the pendulum. in the second experiment, different angles were tested to see if the degree of the angle would affect the period of the pendulum.  also, in the third experiment, different weights were tested to see whether weight had an effect on the period of the pendulum as well. these three experiments helped to show whether they had a positive or negative impact on the pendulum. according to each of the graphs listed above, it was proven that the lengths of the strings had the only effect on the period of the pendulum. the length of the string was tested over a range of 15cm to 180cm. it had a positive slope linear relationship as time went on during each pendulum swing. 

	the theoretical mathematical model for the period of the pendulum came out to 1.42 seconds. this is comparable to our graph because around 50cm (0.5m), the line of best fit passed through 1.56 making the equations off by only .14 seconds. as shown in the figure 1, which shows the length of the string versus time, there was some slight curve fitting shown in the graph. this graph is non-linear and the curve of best fit goes with the equation         $y=\sqrt{x}$               the factors that did not impact the period of the pendulum was both graphs 2 and 3. both of these graphs showed a negative linear slope as time went on in each pendulum swing. a straight line or curve can be passed through every error bar which is proven from the resulted graphs. 

	some errors that were present in this experiment could have been reaction time which could have been a human error. this could be reduced by using a rhythm counter throughout the experiment if it were to be provided. this represents random error because these errors usually result from the experimentâ€™s inability to take the same measurements in the same way over again. another error that was present in this experiment is that the calculations were done wrong causing us to keep redoing calculations in the experiment to get a correct answer. the error just discussed is an example of systematic error. to reduce this error, we could have asked the teacher for more help or for a better clarification on how to solve the problem. constraints in this experiment that may limit the generalizability in this experiment was that the longest length of the pendulum that could be tested in the lab was 180cm so our mathematical model was only generalizable to pendulum lengths no longer than 180cm.
