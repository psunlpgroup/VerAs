conclusion and discussion 

how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?

	based on the data found and the equations calculated, it can be claimed that the increase of applied force (hanging weight) increases the acceleration also increases in a positive, linear manner. evidence for this claim can be seen in figure 1. in this graph one can see that as the force applied increased, the acceleration increased in a positive, linear manner with a r2 value of .9913 which implies a strong correlation between the two values. regarding the error bars, each one is small enough that they do not appear on the graph, and none of them overlap. this means that it is likely that each point graphed is a unique point and that a correlation can be drawn.
	comparing the results from this experiment with another group, in this case group 5, both of us achieved similar results. both this experiment and group 5’s found the acceleration of the cart to increase in a positive, linear manner as the force applied increased. however, their equation has a slightly smaller slope and a positive y-intercept. this positive y-intercept indicates that the outside forces in their experiment had a net positive value, while the outside forces in this experiment had a net negative value. overall, comparing these two shows that it is likely that there is a direct, positive relationship between the force applied and the acceleration of the cart and that there is unknown, external forces affecting the acceleration of the cart.
comparing the results to group 1 is very similar to group 5. again, both found the applied force to have a positive, linear impact on the acceleration of the cart. however, like group 5, their acceleration is slightly smaller than the one found in this experiment and they have a positive y-intercept instead of a negative one. which, as stated above, intercept indicates that the outside forces in their experiment had a net positive value, while the outside forces in this experiment had a net negative value. overall, comparing these two shows that it is likely that there is a direct, positive relationship between the force applied and the acceleration of the cart and that there is unknown, external forces affecting the acceleration of the cart.

theoretical equation

$f=ma$
$a = 5.3533 f$
enhanced theoretical equation
$a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$
$a=\frac{f}{0.18680} + \frac{f_{ext}}{0.18680}$
experimental equation is $a = 4.8818 f - 0.032$
	comparing the experimental equation to the theoretical one shows a strong likeness between the two. the slope of 5.3533kg-1 is very similar to the found slope of 4.8818kg-1. the only difference is the experimental equation has a small, negative y-intercept which could be related to outside forces not accounted for in this experiment. which brings this discussion to the enhanced theoretical model. this model shows that there is a y-intercept of (fext/.18680kg). comparing this to the experimental equation, it can be claimed that this external force must be a negative value. the most likely cause of this is friction, whether in the track or in the pulley since friction in this case is negative since it opposes the motion of the cart.
	if the string was heavier, and considered to have mass, the acceleration of the cart would increase as the cart moved farther towards the pulley, instead of staying constant/uniform. this is because as the cart moved farther to the pulley, more of the string would be hanging of therefore increasing the applied force over time. this increase of applied force as the cart moves to the pulley would increase the acceleration of the cart instead of the acceleration staying constant.
	possible errors in this lab could be attributed to friction, whether it’s friction in the pulley or from the air track. this friction could explain the reason that the slope of experimental equation was lower than the theoretical equation and why the experimental equation had a negative y-intercept instead of a y-intercept of 0. to reduce these errors, the most effective way would be to perform this experiment in a vacuum to eliminate friction. systematic errors in this experiment include the scale which was used to measure the mass of the system. to reduce these systematic errors, the scale could be calibrated to make sure it is accurate. 
	constraints in this lab included the pulley and air track. although these two have a low amount of friction, they are not entirely frictionless. 	it is possible that the friction is high enough that it would reduce the acceleration of the cart, since friction opposes motion. this could be the negative y-intercept since this shows there is some force reducing the acceleration.  another constraint is the mass of the string. as discussed above, the string does have mass (albeit not much) but if the mass is high enough, this would increase the acceleration as the cart moves towards the pulley instead of acceleration remaining uniform.
