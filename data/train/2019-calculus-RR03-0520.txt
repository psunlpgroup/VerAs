discussion and conclusion

	the focus of this experiment was to see which variables can affect the period of a pendulum. these can be any variables that you can think of that relate to a pendulum in motion. the three variables chosen where mass, drop angle and string length. we predicted that drop angle and mass would have little to no effect. the mass prediction was correct, and the drop angle was right for all angles above 20 degrees. we predicted that the string length to period would have a strong positive correlation that would be linear. we were partially correct in the sense that there was a strong positive correlation, but it was power function instead of a linear function. the theoretical model is the $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. this fits very well with the mathematical model my data plotted because they both are power models that have an exponent that is around .5. my mathematical model is $t= 0.2305 l^{0.4837}$. this model obtained an r-value of .9987 which is very strong. the biggest difference in the two models is that the theoretical model has an l input in meters while my model uses a cm input. the theoretical model also backs my hypothesis because there are no inputs for drop angle or mass which means that they do not affect the period. random errors could be present due to the equipment and set up of the experiment. the timers have a certain level of variance and dropping the pendulum without causing an upward or downward force is hard and isn’t always negligible. we reduced the effect of the timers and added velocity by using the photogate system which is a precise measuring instrument that eliminates human impact. some constraints of this experiment are that we weren’t able to test how air density or how the type of string could affect the period.
