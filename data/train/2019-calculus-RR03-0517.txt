conclusion:

what impacts the period of a pendulum?



random errors would cause 𝛔 to become larger, since they would be making the spread larger, and they are directly related. systematic errors would not affect 𝛔 since it would move the mean, along with the spread. it would move the mean because systematic errors are constant and affect each data point the same amount.



constraints is  not enough research was done to prove whether or not our work was valid.
