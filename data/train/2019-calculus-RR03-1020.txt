conclusion and discussion


this experiment was meant to show what we had already learned through our first two labs. we based the lab on our research question, which independent variable actually impacts the period of the pendulum? as found in the first two labs, the length of string to be the only really effect on the situation. however, our previous labs had a number of random and systematic errors. to try and improve these errors and find values close to the true value to see if our data were correct, we used a more accurate system to find the period of the pendulum. we took multiple trials and analyzed information, we found that our original findings were correct, and using a better system just proved it right even more. there was a lower degree of uncertainty which helped to get a more accurate line of fit. factors that change the period of a pendulum either significantly or significantly is  inaccuracies in release angle, inaccuracies in the timer. the timer is insignificant, but with the release in angle it can be significant with our error when reading the protractor. data and claims from other groups support the same hypotheses as ours. their equations were also linear relationship equations and indicated a negatively sloped line. this can impact all levels of confidence by lowering the level of uncertainty and backing up our overall claims. the theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum is $t=2$ * âˆš(l/g). this would make our prediction correct as acceleration number increases, the value will increase. most of the improvements that could be made are within the manual itself, a lot of the explanations are vague when carrying out the experiment. this leads to different interpretations of the procedures that may lead to non-uniform data.
