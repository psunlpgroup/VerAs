conclusion:

	lab 03 brought together all of the previous labs to demonstrate that the data found in the past had flaws and should have been repeated with improvements. the main question of all the labs was to find what variables affected the period of a pendulum. in the end it was found that the only factor that could affect the period of a pendulum was the length of the pendulum. originally it was thought that it followed a linear line but after using a much more accurate form of collecting data, it actually followed a power curve. the other two independent variables of mass and angle did not affect the period of the pendulum. both of the graph’s trendlines had a slope of almost zero which shows that there is no correlation. the reason the slopes weren’t exactly zero was due to the fact that the error bars showed that there was a source of error involved. the data found is corroborated by other scientists in which the theoretical model described is 2.006 when what was found during the experiment was 2.0058. the constraints within the experiment were time limits and not having extremely accurate data collecting devices. the time constraint would affect the data because individuals conducting the experiment would rush through the experiment to be done before the time given is up. this would cause many inaccuracies within the data like what happened in the experiment conducted last week. not having extremely accurate data collecting devices would have made the period measurements slightly off instead of say using ten decimals when 4 decimals was actually used. overall, the data found was very close to the theoretical value.
