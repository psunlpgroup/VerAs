discussion and conclusion: 

	the research question being studied during these three experiments was what impacts the period of a pendulum. one of the factors that we decided to study was the mass of the weight and the impact it had on the period of the pendulum. we did this by keeping the angle of release the same and also by keeping the length of the string the same but changing the mass of the weight. you can see this shown in table 5 above. the results of this experiment are shown in figure 2 above. these results prove that the mass of the weight does not have an impact on the period of the pendulum because there was no pattern seen when we graphed the resulting numbers. there was no trend neither up nor down of the mass of the weight when speaking in terms of the period of the pendulum. we also studied how the angle of release impacted the period of the pendulum and we did this by keeping the length of the string the same and by keeping the mass of the weight the same, but we then changed the angle of release. you can see this shown in table 6 above. this study also resulted in no trends or patterns when looking at the angle of release versus the period of a pendulum on figure 3 above. the last thing we studied was how the length of the string impacted the period of the pendulum. we did this by keeping the angle of release and the mass of the weight the same throughout the experiment, but then we changed the length of the string. you can see this by looking at table 3 above. the results of this experiment showed that the length of the string did impact the period of the pendulum. as the length of the string increased, so did the period of the pendulum. this is seen by looking at figure 1 above. the mathematical model of the period of a pendulum that we figured out in lab 3 by graphing the length of the string versus the period of the pendulum is $y=0.1206348 x$ with r2 is 0.999. you can see this by looking at figure 4 above. the theoretical mathematical model of the period of a pendulum is       $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$          . by looking at this theoretical mathematical model, you can predict how long the period of the pendulum will be based on what number you plug in for the length of the string. as you can see in figure 4 above, the longer the length of the string, the longer the period will be. you can tell that the mass of the weight and the angle of release would not affect the period of the pendulum because mass and angle of release aren’t even involved in the equation. 

	only random errors were present during this lab. one example of this could be if the stopwatch wasn’t started and stopped at the exact moments that it was supposed to be. we tried reducing this error by having the same person control the stopwatch throughout every single experiment. another random error that could have occurred during this experiment could be that the angle of release being slightly off from what it was supposed to be every time. we tried to reduce this error by making the same person release the weight throughout each of the experiments. 

	a constraint that can be seen when looking at this experiment is that we did not do enough tests and trials. this could overall affect the average results that we received. another constraint that can be seen when looking at this experiment is not being able to change the different measurements enough. for example, if we could affect the length of the string a lot more dramatically, maybe they results would have stuck out to us a lot sooner.
