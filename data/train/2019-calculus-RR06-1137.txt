discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of the first lab was to develop mathematical models that describe a system of forces.  the purpose of the second lab was to identify what each of the forces were, that we did not control for.
in the first experiment, we tested for how the applied force affected the system with a constant mass of the system.  this would be shown in newton’s second law by $a=\frac{f}{m}$ which is shown in our mathematical model, $a = 2.8514 f - 0.0111$(m/s^2).  the value 2.18514(kg^-1) represents the inverse of the mass of the system which will cancel out with the iv of ‘f’ to get m/s^2.  the value of -0.0111(m/s^2) is most likely some outside force acting on the system.  graph 1 supports this model because it shows that as the force applied, f, increases the acceleration of the system, a, also increases.  this matches newton’s second law because $a=\frac{f}{m}$ ‘a’ and ‘f’ are directly proportional.
in the second experiment, we tested for how the mass of the system affected the acceleration of the system.  this would be shown in newton’s second law by $a=\frac{f}{m}$ which is shown in our model, $a = 0.0767 m^{-1.096}$.  the value of 0.0767(n) represents the constant force applied to the system.  the variable ‘m’ is the iv ‘mass of the system’, which is raised to the -1.096 because it needs to be the inverse to match newton’s second law, $a=\frac{f}{m}$.  graph 2 supports this by showing the inverse relationship for acceleration and mass of the system with a negative that shows that as the mass of the system increase the acceleration of the system decreases.
in the third experiment, we tested for the outside force found in experiment 1.  we tested this by putting extra mass on the cart in varying places to see if friction played a role in the mathematical models.  this gave us three equations is  $a = 1.7941 f + 0.0194$ (m/s^2), $a = 1.8971 f - 0.0584$(m/s^2), and $a = 1.8322 f - 0.0078$(m/s^2).  the first equation isn’t helpful because it doesn’t match the equation found in experiment 1.  the values all match the description from experiment 1.  the graph matches that of experiment 1 by showing that as the force increased the acceleration of the system does as well.
this data was provided by group #4. their data was collected by varying the applied force on the system, the same as us.  their equations resemble ours; however, they did not provide a claim or their mass of the system for us to compare the relationships we found with theirs.
	this data was provided by group #1.  they tested the effect of a slanted track on the 

system.  their conclusion states that when the height of the track is elevated on the side 

with the pulley, the acceleration of the system increases.  their conclusion is supported by the fact that having a positive height means a higher change in energy and more kinetic energy.  one of group 1’s mathematical models was $a =0.3475 f + 0.0006$.  this shows that acceleration is equal to a constant multiplied by the force applied plus a friction coefficient.
a systematic error in our experiments was when we were weighing the mass of the system and the bobs.  this was caused by having the same person measure the masses because the same person will judge when the scale is balanced the same way for the experiment.  this will move all of the masses of the experiment in a particular direction.
constraints for the experiment included the length of the fishing line, the amount of mass that could be added to the system, and the impossibility of removing all friction from the track.  since the fishing line only had a finite length we started the glider at 650cm every trial.  additionally, we only had a certain amount of mass we could add to the system, so we couldn’t test for extremely large values.  lastly, there was a small amount of friction still present in the system that we could not remove, so the environment was not completely ideal to only test for one variable at a time.
our first mathematical model is shown in newton’s second law by $a=\frac{f}{m}$ which is shown in our mathematical model, $a = 2.8514 f - 0.0111$(m/s^2).  the value 2.18514(kg^-1) represents the inverse of the mass of the system which will cancel out with the iv of ‘f’ to get m/s^2.  the value of -0.0111(m/s^2) is most likely some outside force acting on the system
our second mathematical model is shown in newton’s second law by $a=\frac{f}{m}$ which is shown in our model, $a = 0.0767 m^{-1.096}$.  the value of 0.0767(n) represents the constant force applied to the system.  the variable ‘m’ is the iv ‘mass of the system’, which is raised to the -1.096 because it needs to be the inverse to match newton’s second law, $a=\frac{f}{m}$.
