discussion and conclusion

	this experiment shows that there is a relationship between the force applied to a system and the resulting acceleration. through testing we were able to prove our initial prediction that the more force applied the higher the acceleration will be. the experiment conducted shows that the force applied to a system and its acceleration are directly related. in the end, the experiment shows the linear relationship between force applied and acceleration. however, our groups experiment suffered some errors that made the challenge experiment almost impossible. in graph 1 the mathematical model is 3.9206x+0.1413 which is problematic because the linear function given has a y-intercept of 0.1413 which means that is began with an acceleration and not at zero. 

       

the photos above show two other groups in the lab who conducted the same experiment.  the group on the right had the same issue that our group did but the group on the left has a y-intercept of 0.0318 which is way closer to zero than 0.1413 is. some external forces that could have had an impact on the mathematical model is air pressure and small amounts of friction. the air pressure being pumped out of the track had enough force to start the cart at an acceleration rather than just starting from rest. if a different string was used to hang the masses, then if the string isnâ€™t massless it would have an effect on the system because the mass of the entire system would change. our group tried to minimize error as much as possible by measuring the mass of the bobbers individually and repeated the experiment from the same release point.
