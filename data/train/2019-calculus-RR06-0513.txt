conclusion and discussion:



we figured out that as the force is adjusted the acceleration of the system increases in a linear fashion, we figured out that as the mass changes in the system, the acceleration increases in a power graph, and we figured out that the friction on the cart actually had no effect on the system and it stayed relatively the same which caused the overall system to stay the same. because as the mass on the cart changed the acceleration increased in a linear function, the acceleration of the system stayed very close to the same throughout the experiment and the changing of friction, this means that the change in friction had very little overall effect on the system. i think there is nothing else need to be tasted, that means there are no other factors that have an effect on the overall system except friction and slope. the last but not the least, in order to improve this experiment, we should change the counter weight, and utilize stronger magnets.
