discussion and conclusion:



   the research questions that are being investigated in this lab are if weight, the length of string or if the angle of release affect the time it takes to make a pendulum to swing once. we conducted experiments on all three of these factors individually while keeping the other two variables that were not being used as controls (this is listed on each experimental design template). the results and tables listed above. in developing our mathematical model for the period a pendulum takes to swing, we had eliminated weight from our independent variables because we found that it did not affect the period of the pendulum. we instead decided to use the weight as a control variable when testing the angle and length. we initially thought that these two independent variables would have a linear relationship with time and were correct in assuming so. we encountered both random and systematic errors. one random error we kept encountering is not correctly timing the swing with a stopwatch which was later corrected by using a device that did it with better accuracy. one systematic error we encountered was that when releasing the pendulum, we found that one of our group members were either releasing it from angles that were not being tested or would let the weight drop straight down instead of letting the tension in the string do so and these errors had a large impact on our final results and made them not reliable to use. this error can be avoided by just including clearer instructions on the lab process and telling people testing this to avoid errors like this. a potential constraint that can possibly limit our results from being generalized is that we did not perform enough trials in order to get a better and more accurate result.
