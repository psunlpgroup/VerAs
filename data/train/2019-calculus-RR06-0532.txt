Discussion and Conclusion (Applied Force/Hanging Mass):
Based my lab group’s experiment with the applied force as the independent variable and the acceleration of the slider as the dependent variable, we found that there is relationship between the applied force (N) and the acceleration (m/s^2). For each trial, we set our control variables (constants) as gravity, starting string length (500mm), and the mass of slider (301g). The trendline generated by our data and graph almost exactly followed the data points in a straight line. The r^2 value was .99 proving that there is almost no variability in the data at all and that there is a positive linear relationship. Additionally, the error bars for each trial were small. Based on the overwhelming amount of evidence obtained from the data taken during each trial, there is a positive linear relationship between applied force and acceleration of the slider. Our theoretical model for the experiment was is  $a=0.0024 x + 0.014$ where x is the applied force

Based on team one’s mathematical model, we can safely conclude that this group’s findings support our team’s results and conclusions. Their theoretical model is very close to our theoretical model generated with very slight discrepancies in the slope and y intercept. The slope is only off ours by 0.0253 and their y intercept is only off by 0.0013.

Based on team four’s mathematical model, we can conclude that this group’s findings support our team’s results and conclusions. Their theoretical model is nearly the same as our theoretical model generated with very slight discrepancies in the slope and y intercept. The slope is only off ours by 0.01083 and their y intercept is only off by 0.0147.
Theoretical Equation is  $a = \frac{f_{applied}}{m_{sys}}$
Mathematical Model is  $a=0.0024 x + 0.014$
Our experimental mathematical model supports the theoretical model because from our data obtained, we know the relationship between applied force and acceleration is linear, therefore as the applied force increases, the acceleration also increases. Students can input applied force for x in our mathematical model and the acceleration would increases just like the theoretical model. 
Theoretical Equation is  $a =\frac{f + f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ 
Our experimental model supports the theoretical model because from our data obtained, the relationship between applied force is still linear even with outside forces added on, therefore as the applied force still increases, the acceleration would still increase as well. Additionally, the outside forces changed our y-intercept drastically as it should making it go from positive to negative. 
 
If a heavy string would be connecting the hanging weight with the cart, the acceleration would be increase since the heavier string would causes a higher force of gravity pulling the mass down causing an increase in acceleration. 
 
In all experiments, there were fluctuations in data that could have been affected for a multitude of reasons. Systematic errors that may have altered the data in the trial include friction caused by air resistance as well as the pulley/vacuum system which may potentially change the acceleration measured, and the tension of the string which we could not measure, may also cause a fluctuation in acceleration results. Additionally, the computer program may have been faulty which would cause substantial error throughout every trial of the experiment. Random error that may have altered the data in the trial include the starting length not the same for every trial and the vacuum setup may have been faulty which could potentially cause error in the experiment since we used it for every trial. Systematic errors can be eliminated or reduced by solving the issue at its core. In our experiment, we would adjust the scale so it’s one-hundred percent accurate and measure the air resistance and tension for every trial. Random errors can be reduced by refining the measurement technique or by repeating the measurements for more trials and taking the average.
