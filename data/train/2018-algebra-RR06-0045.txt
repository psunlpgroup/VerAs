discussion and conclusion

the research question being investigated in this experiment was, how, does the acceleration of a system change when the hanging mass of the system is changed? the purpose of the experiment was to obtain an explanation for how the acceleration was related to the force applied of gravity and the hanging mass using newtonâ€™s laws. the experiment conducted consisted using a hanging mass connected to a cart, the system, on an almost frictionless track using datastudio to record the findings to obtain the acceleration of the cart. the hanging mass was the independent variable and the acceleration of the cart was the dependent variable. the mass of the system was kept the same however, the hanging mass was increased every trial by removing weights (bobbers) from the cart and adding it the hanging portion. by doing this the force of gravity and the hanging mass were able to be used as the force applied. as the mass hanging increased so did the force applied. 

this method allowed our group to address the research question by doing eight trials with increasing the hanging mass with each trial. as can be seen from table 1.2 as the hanging mass increased so did the acceleration of the cart. this relationship is also demonstrated in figure 1.1, but rather the acceleration is plotted against the force applied, which is the force of gravity on the increasing mass hanging resulting in greater force applied. the graph shows that as the force applied increased, because the hanging mass increased, so did acceleration. the error bars in the graph are too small to be seen however, the horizontal bars represent the uncertainty of the force (mass times gravity) which was found by multiplying the half the smallest increment on the scale (.00005kg) by the acceleration of gravity. and the vertical error bars are the uncertainty of acceleration obtained from the graph of the velocity vs time graph in datastudio. 

the data gathered from the experiment and figure 1.1, a mathematical equation of $y= c1 x+c2$, in which $c1= 5.1023$ and $c2= 0.0202$, was developed, where y represents the acceleration of the system and x is the force applied. this equation gathered shows a positive linear relationship between the acceleration of the system and the force applied due to the increase in hanging mass. the claim that can be made is that as the hanging mass increases the acceleration also increases. 

 when comparing our findings with other groups findings the same conclusion can be made using their findings. the experimental equation by group 3g1b found a positive linear relationship between the acceleration and force applied, as seen in figure 1.2. the discrepancies between their data is the exact numbers, (c1 is 4.961 & c2 is -0.0841), in their equation which is due to the group having a different mass of the system than our group. a similar conclusion about the mathematical model found by group 1, see figure 1.3, can be made. their group found a positive linear relation between the acceleration and mass hanging as well, except their exact number, c1 is 0.0053 is much smaller as they might have used the mass hanging instead of the mass of the system. the same discrepancy comes with their value of c2 (6x10^-3) is much smaller because they have such a small value of c1 resulting in a very low y-intercept to fit the data. 

the mathematical model found in the experiment, $y=c1 x+c2$, when c2 equals zero, relates to the theoretical model of a single force, $f=m_{sys} a$. as stated previously, the force applied was found to be (the hanging mass* 9.8 m/s^2)/1000. in trial 1 the force applied was found to be 0.04753n. plugging this value of force into the theoretical model and using the mass of the system, .18886 kg, a theoretical value of acceleration was found to be .210 m/s^2., and the experimental value was found to be 0.252 m/s^2. this value differs from our experimental value by .042 m/s^2. when exterior forces are present the enhanced theoretical equation, $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, the experimental equation found, $y=c1 x+c2$, ($y=5.1023 x-0.2020$) relates to the theoretical equation. the theoretical value for c1, (1/msys), would be 5.2949. this value is greater than the experimental c1 value of 5.1023. and the theoretical number for c2 (fext*msys) would result in -3.8*10^-3 n which is also lower than the experimental value of c2 found -.2020.

if a non-massless string was used to connect the hanging weight and the cart the acceleration of the system would increase. this would be since the acceleration of the system from our data is linearly proportional to the hanging mass. by increasing the string weight, the hanging mass would increase too, thus causing an increase in acceleration. 

a possible random error of the experiment could be the measurements obtained for the weight of the bobbers and the system. this could be due to the fact the scale being used can be hard to read leading to values of weights being over and under the actual value. a way to fix this error would be to weigh the system and the bobbers several times to get a more correct average weight. also, regarding the scale, a systematic error that could be present is the scale measuring too high or too low of values, due to use of the years of use. this could be fixed by using new digitals scales or using multiple scales to get an average reading to decide how far off the one scale is. some constraints that came with this experiment would be not having enough time to do multiple trials for each trial, or to be able to weigh the bobbers multiple times to get an average mass of the bobbers to reduce errors. also, with the lab class only being given the same number of bobbers, the results between the groups would be generalized due to groups using the same number of bobbers, resulting in similar masses of the systems.
