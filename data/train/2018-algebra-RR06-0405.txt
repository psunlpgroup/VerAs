discussion/conclusion:

what other forces, other than that due to the hanging mass, may be present in the experimental context which needs to be considered when comparing to the theoretical model? external forces such as wind, air pressure from the slide strip, etc. all impact our measurements and account for the presence of a non-zero y-intercept in our mathematical model. the mass shows up in the experimental model as the coefficient (the inverse of mass is the coefficient in the model). the error bars concentration of values is high; therefore, the average is more certain when testing the acceleration vs applied force. from this, we could see that the hanging weight does affect the acceleration. based on two other student groups data, we find that it supports our results as they have the same range of data and a close mathematical model as ours. though ours is a bit more different, we also had more issues with our system such as a hole in the vacuum. 

the vacuum had a hole in it (and thus some friction was present) and the presence of any external forces acting in a consistent, uniform direction. some human errors could have been, when letting go of the system, some people pushed it, therefore, increasing its applied force drastically. to reduce these, we could have connected and taped the tubing, so the friction would have been significantly less than ours. as for human errors, we have to actively watch we are letting go without any force applied to push the system. if the string used to connect the small weight to the cart had appreciable mass, would the cart still undergo uniform acceleration? $f =m a$.  because the mass would be changing over time (as more of the weighted string passes through the pulley) the cart would be accelerating unevenly (nonuniform).  some constraints are the devices and technique used to measure our data, such as the devices to measure mass. the measurements are not precise as they only go to +/- .1 measure of precision.
