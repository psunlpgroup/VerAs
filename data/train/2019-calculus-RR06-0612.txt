discussion and conclusion: 

in this lab our group developed mathematical models to describe the behavior of a real-world system. firstly, we explored how the acceleration of a system would change when the force applied was altered. we predicted that by increasing the force applied that the acceleration in turn would increase as well. to ensure that no outside factors would influence the acceleration we kept the mass and string length constant. as seen in the first graph as the force applied increase the acceleration grew as well. secondly, we explored how the acceleration of a system would change as the mass was changed as well. our group hypothesized that as the mass was increased the acceleration would decrease. to limit error, we kept the force applied and the string length the same throughout the trials. as seen in the second graph, while the mass grew the acceleration shrunk confirming our prediction. lastly, we analyzed how the force would affect the acceleration with the magnetic strips causing friction. we predicted the same as before that as force increased so would our acceleration. as before we kept the mass and the force of gravity the same. our final two graphs show that while the friction caused an effect on the acceleration it still increased as the force applied was increased as well. a possible source of error in this experiment could’ve been the inconsistency of the fishing bobs that we used as our masses. the masses of these bobs varied slightly from bob to bob and could’ve had an influence on the acceleration of the system. in the future standardized weights would be preferred as they would be consistent. a constraint of this experiment is that with the lack of outside factors affecting the system, it is unlikely that the same results would be recreated in real world setting.
