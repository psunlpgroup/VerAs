discussion/conclusion: 

at the start of this experiment the question was “is there a correlative relationship between force and acceleration?” in order to find the answer to this question, we set up and experiment using an air track, two masses (m1 and m2), and a pulley system. it was assumed that friction was negligible and any other forces other than gravity were not taken into account. after running eight trials with different hanging masses, graph 1 was obtained. according to this, there is a strong linear relationship between force and mass. this makes sense because of the equation . in order to find the acceleration, re-arrange the equation to to increase the force, you need a larger mass or acceleration. our findings are backed up by other groups as well, only further proving newton’s second law. when given a new acceleration and told to find the weight of the hanging mass we developed the equation.  				  this equation allowed us to get a mass of 0.017kg or 17g as our hanging mass. we also got the same result when using $f=ma$. a possible systematic error in this experiment could be the scale used to weigh the mass of m1 and m2 could have been incorrectly calibrated and caused the masses to be off in either direction. another systematic error could be possible friction between m1 and the air track causing our acceleration to be smaller than expected. a random error could be air resistance on the hanging object, causing it to fall slower than expected. to correct for these errors, we need to take them into consideration when doing our calculations, or preform the experiment in a vacuum and frictionless plane.
