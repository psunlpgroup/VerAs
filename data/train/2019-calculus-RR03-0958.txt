conclusion:



	this experiments purpose was to test and see what factors could possibly effect the period of pendulum. the experiment showed that length was the only dependent variable that had an impact on the period of a pendulum. as shown in graph 1., there is a linear correlation between the length and period. as the length increases, so does the period. in graph 2. and 3. the period stays relatively close to the same time showing that the angle and mass of the pendulum have no correlation to the period. the differences in the graphs are due to the uncertainty of the timing. our conclusions from what effects the period, supports the theoretical model for the period of a pendulum. the model states that $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ this makes sense with our results since length is the only variable we tested that effects the period and the model includes length and not mass or angle. the uncertainty our data has would come from the multiple random errors and systematic errors involved in the experiment. our random errors were the human error of timing the period and our readings of the angle of release. possible ways to reduce those were to have a photogate record the time and have a set marker to release from. the one systematic error we had was the uncertainty of the stopwatch we used. a constraint we had was that it was difficult to release from the right angle since we were using such small angles. it was also difficult to spot when the pendulum reached one full swing and time that right. these couldâ€™ve changed our results quite considerably.
