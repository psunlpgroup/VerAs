discussions and conclusion:

	the question that we researched was “how does the acceleration of the car change when you change its mass or the friction acting on the car?” we did this by conducting 3 separate experiments, one was testing how changing the hanging mass affects the acceleration of the car, the second was testing how changing the car mass affects the acceleration, and finally we tested how friction affects the acceleration of the car. the only instrument that we used that produced an important uncertainty was the rotary motion sensor, however the uncertainty was so small that it did not really matter and did not require error bars. in our linear equation for the friction vs acceleration test, the value of b is how much friction there was between the cart and track and showed that there is a negative correlation between friction and acceleration. we also found that there was a negative correlation between increasing the cars mass and the acceleration, however, there was a positive correlation between increasing the hanging mass and the acceleration. there really were not many ways to produce error in this experiment as we made sure that we released the car from the same position on the track each time and the sensors were accurate. some constraints of this experiment could be the type of air track that we used, it will not be the same default values as any other track and so the starting values for friction will be different or our track could have been not completely horizontal and so caused some inherent drift of the car.
