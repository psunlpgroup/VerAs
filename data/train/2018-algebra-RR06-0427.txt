the purpose of both labs was to figure out how the acceleration of the cart changes as the applied force is changed. the purpose of lab 05 was to develop a mathematical model to predict the motion of an object due to an applied force. the purpose of lab 06 was to compare our mathematical model calculated to two other groups data. the experiment that we conducted allowed us to create a mathematical model for our results by finding the trend line of the graph of our results (figure 1.).  this gave us the model of $y=c x + c$ and an actual equation of $y=5.34 x + 0.006$.  we used this equation to compare it to a calculated theoretical mathematical model, given the mass of our system, which we got to be c1 is (1/.187) so 5.3kg^-1.  when we compared our theoretical model to our experimental model its shows that they are the same number telling us that there were no external forces acting upon our system. the horizontal and vertical error bars cannot be seen on figure 1. the graph in figure 1 shows a linear trend line meaning the acceleration vs. the mass of the hanging weight were positively correlated. for 3g1b, they obtained the same theoretical c1 value of 5.34 but they got a different experimental value for c1, being 4.6961 where ours was 5.34.  this shows that they had more error in their experiment than we did, but it is still relatively similar to our value. the dusty pigeons got a c1 theoretical value of 5.2949 (figure 5) which is very close to our theoretical value of 5.34 (figure 3). the experimental value they obtained was 5.1023 which tells us they had some error in their experiment. 3g1b and dusty pigeons had larger fext values than we did. the dusty pigeons obtained a fext value of .0038 (figure 5) and 3g1b obtained a fext value of 0.0179. this supports our model because they had more error in their c1 theoretical and experimental which would mean that they would have more external forces acting upon their system than we did. there can be many external forces that are acting upon our system such as air resistance, friction, etc.  these forces will show up in the experimental model in the value of c2.  $c2=\frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. because we know the mass of the system, we can figure out the value of the external forces acting on our system. the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model as part of the value of c1.  $c1=\frac{1}{m_{sys}}$. a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart would not have an influence on the uniform acceleration of the cart. when looking at the theoretical math equation, you do weigh the string along with the cart but if it is a frictionless track and wheel, then the mass of the string would not have a big significance on the acceleration. the theoretical equation of $f=m_{sys} a$ made it possible for us to calculate our force in table 1 above. which we then made figure 2 above to obtain our c1 value. this equation supports the theoretical equation of $a=c1 x +c2$. there was no curve fitting in our graphs because our data was linear. the theoretical equation of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ is the exact same equation as $y=c x + c$. this equation was derived from the $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ equation. our experimental mathematical model supports the theoretical model because we were able to find these values and they ended up being the same for both theoretical and experimental. if there were external forces acting upon our experiment then this would show that the experimental and theoretical values would be different but still similar depending on how much the external forces affected the experiment. random errors in this experiment could have been that the mass of the hanging weight was off due to scale error but since our data showed that it was equal to theoretical value, there was no error in our experiment. a way to reduce the error would be to weigh the hanging masses multiple times and averaging them to have a more accurate weight when calculating force. the generalizability is limited because the carts and bobs vary in masses. also, different masses (of the system or the hanging mass) will lead to different accelerations which are used to calculate our results. this makes our results specific to our masses and less general (less applicable to the experiments of others).
