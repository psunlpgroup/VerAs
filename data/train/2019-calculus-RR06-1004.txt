conclusion:
 the purpose of lab 05 was to create mathematical models to describe the behavior of a real system, while in lab 06 the purpose was to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model.

the three experiments led to the resulting mathematical models of $a=c f + c$ and a $=c m^{- c}$ where f is force (n), m is mass (kg), c1 is 1/mass of system, and c2 is the external forces.  so, based on figure 1 in lab 05 (mass (force applied) versus acceleration) the equation equaled $y = 2.8295 x – 0.0138$. likewise, all the figures found in lab 06 were found to be the linear mathematical model of $a=c f + c$. furthermore, in lab 06 with each addition of a magnet the c2 value decreases which shows an increase in friction.  additionally, in the lab 05 figure 2 (mass of cart (mass of system) versus acceleration) the equation produced from the graph was $y = 0.2955 x^{-1.222}$. this equation then could be generalized into the power model of c1*m^-c2 where through dimensional analysis we found c1 to equal the inverse of the mass of the system and c2 to be equal to the external forces.

 we were unable to provide a picture of other teams work in our lab section due to errors but based on the data collected and given to us by our lab ta we were able to conclude that the tilt experiment also created a linear model of $a=c f + c$, where the external force represented by c2 was gravitational force. so, as they increased tilt the cart would accelerate faster due to this increase in force. these results then contribute to the understanding of our mathematical model because where we subtract our external force of friction, they add their external force of gravitational force.

 the systematic errors in this experiment were not using strong enough magnets, the frictionless track not being level and the tape not securing the magnets firmly onto the cart to create a force of friction. the random errors in this experiment were the uncertainties in the online graphing tool and the scale.  these errors could be reduced in future labs if their was a better way to attach the magnets to the cart, providing stronger magnets, and providing a level at every lab desk instead of eyeballing the track to make sure that it is level.

 the constraints in this experiment that may limit the generalization of our results were the number of magnets, bobbers and weights we could attach to the cart, the weight of the cart, and only using the frictionless track provided in lab. 

 the two experimental models $a=c f + c$ and c1*m^-c2 are consistent with newton’s second law. the equation $a=c f + c$ is because the masses are held constant because as we take one bobber of from the hanging side it is put on the cart.  as a result, the mass is constant therefore the only thing that is left that can change the sum of the forces is acceleration and as acceleration decreases so does the sum of the forces.  also, the equation c1*m^-c2 is consistent with newtons second law because the hanging bobbers are held constant and as the mass of the cart increases the acceleration of the cart will have to decrease to keep the net force of the hanging bobbers constant.
