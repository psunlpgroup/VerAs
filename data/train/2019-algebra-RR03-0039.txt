conclusion:
We chose three variables to see which one would affect the period. First, we tested if the string length would change the period of the pendulum. We found that as the length increased so did the period, you can see this in our graph of length vs time. Second, we tested the string angle when released. We did not see enough of a change in the times to say for sure that the angle changed the time. You can see in our graph that the times are very close together. Last we tested the mass of the pendulum. We did not see a change in time when testing the weight. In our graph you can see there is no change corresponding to the weight.
The theoretical mathematical equation is 1.99x^.05 and our model is very close to this equation. As you can see in our string length vs time graph our equation is only 0.0929 away from the theoretical equation. In both the other graphs they are very far off which tells us it does not affect the period
 Throughout these experiments we tried to limit the error as much as possible. We used multiple stop watches in the first experiment to try and limit random error in timing the pendulum. In the third experiment we used the photogate to reduce timing error. 
One constraint was the length of the string, we only had so much string which limited the amount of data points we could get. Second the weight was a constraint because we could have used more weight or less weight.
