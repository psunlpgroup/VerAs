conclusion:
The purpose of labs 5 was to find out if a correlation between the acceleration of the sleigh and changes in the weight of the sleigh and the weight of the system existed. Lab 6 was done to find if there was a correlation between the lab setting, more specifically the angle of the track, and the acceleration of the actual sleigh. 
The first experiment in lab 5 showed a direct, positive correlation between the weight on the string, and the acceleration of the sled. Using the data acquired, the values led to a mathematical model of $y=2.6202 x - 0.0056$. This was done by using excell to show the link between the variables. The second experiment in lab 6 showed a negative correlation between the weight of the system and the acceleration of the sleigh. This led to a mathematical model of $y=\frac{0.0825}{x^{1.433}}$ this was done by using the values to show the link between the variables.

Both groups also concluded that the outside force had a direct affect on the acceleration of the system. Both groups saw a significant difference in the values of F, which aligns with the conclusion that the value is the summation of the outsides forces on the system. This is shown in board 1 with the two positive angles having F values of 0.0427 and 0.1648, while the negative angle, which should have a negative F value since the incline is facing away from the direction of motion, has a value of -0.0861.
One source of error we encountered was problems with the wheel that measured the acceleration of the system. We found that using too little weight wouldn’t spin the wheel, thus returning a value of 0. To counter this, we raised the minimum weight and adjusted the increments accordingly. Another source of error could be found in the measuring of the weights which would return different results for the mathematical model, and the graph. 
Constraints that could limit the generalization of the results was the inability to use larger variations in the angle/heights of the ramp. Using only small variations could be interpreted as negligible changes that don’t show a correlation in acceleration.
Our mathematical models are consistent with Newtons Second law because the models showed that the total force was equal to the mass of the system times the acceleration, such as in the first and second models $y=2.6202 x - 0.0056$, and The equation of the graph is $y=0.0825 x^{-1.433}$.
