conclusion:
The correct theoretical equation is           $T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$             . the data we collected fit to our line of best fit and made sense for our graph, but the data didn’t match the equation. This was the data from when we tested the with the photo gate to accurately collect the time. The random errors that could have happened during the experiment would have been the scale to see if the weight is right, the scale could have been calibrated wrong, another error could have been the people taking the time with the stopwatches, someone could have been off and skewed the data.
Constraints that we had for this experiment were that we had to keep the angle under a certain degree to keep the string from jumping and to insure a smooth swing. We had a limit of how long the string could be due to the pole only being able to go so tall. The mass of the object couldn’t be under 50 grams which is also a constraint on how low the weight could have been.
