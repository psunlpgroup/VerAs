discussion/conclusion:

			the purpose of this experiment was to create a mathematical model that would be capable of predicting the acceleration of a system due to an applied force acted upon it. upon completion of an eight-step trial, we found from the trial 8 graph that the linear fit produced the best fit line with an r^2 value of .09662. the mathematical relationship, therefore was the linear equation is  $y=4.2973 x + 0.1012$ following the model of $a= c1 w+c2$. the theoretical model read as follows is  $a=\frac{f}{m}$ $a = \frac{f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$. it compared quite well to our experimental model found, as shown in picture 1 above. graph 1 shows the exact linear equation that supports our data and shows a positive correlation between applied force and acceleration. the error bars from this graph are too small to see but correlate with the findings. other than the hanging mass, there was inevitable kinetic friction that acted as a force on the experimental model. any air resistance when the system was moving across the air track would have altered the findings and differed more from the theoretical model, which stated negligible extra forces. to show this unavoidable, unknown force, it is represented as b, in our linear equation stated above. the mass of the systems shows up in the experimental model as the slope, where it is the inverse of the mass. if the string that was used to connect the hanging mass and the cart’s mass had appreciable mass itself, then the acceleration would uniformly increase as a result of the effect mass has on force. 

			the findings from the monkeys as well as the data shown from team squrt support our conclusions about the positive effect applied force has on acceleration. both teams discussed the positive correlation they found, and the direct relationship force and acceleration have on each other. we also had stated a very similar hypothesis, which we were able to support with our final results. the control variables that each of the two groups chose, ran closely to our values, so any variation that was produced was minimal and insignificant to the conclusions. 

		 	some possible environmental factors or experimental errors could have included, but not limited to the following is  smallest difference in the point of release, level ground of the air track, air resistance that could have slowed the acceleration, and different weight of each bobber. the random errors in this experiment would include the different points of release. this possible difference could only be reduced if the person that was releasing the system took extra, diligent care and measured the distance in smaller increments to insure the most similar findings possible. a systematic error in this lab could have been the level or non-level surface of the air track. depending on the surface changes, the acceleration could definitely decrease, or increase based on the non-even slope that it is riding on. in order to reduce this, a level should have been placed on the air track prior to any trial being conducted to ensure that the entire length of the path was smooth. the constraints of this experiment would be the amount of time given, the limited amount of supplies, as only one track could be used per group, and trusting that all the given materials worked properly. generally, these constraints rush and hurt the experiment’s overall accuracy but were unavoidable during this lab.
