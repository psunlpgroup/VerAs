conclusion:
All of the groups provide data that conforms to the idea that as the applied force increases, the acceleration of the system increases as well. This is seen by all the groups having positive trendlines and data points that rest on, or very close to, those trendlines. This idea that as force increases, acceleration also increases, is the shared claim between the group that had a claim that we looked at, as well as ourselves.
Our experimental equation was determined to be $y=4.7231 x - 0.012$ where the basis for the theoretical equation can be found through arithmetic and is $F=m a$ so  $a=\frac{f}{m}$  so  $a=\frac{f_{hanging} +f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$   as a result  $a= C1 F_{hanging} +C2$. This equation, found by directly rearranging the theoretical equation, is only viable if the mass of the system stays constant. This is because if the mass changes, the C1 constant will change and, therefore, no longer be a constant. As can be seen through the process above, the theoretical equation had its force component split up into its base component (in this case the applied force and any unknown forces acting on the system) before then splitting the resulting fraction into two. The first of these two became the variable (Force applied, and its slope (because the mass didn’t change it was treated as a constant that gave the slope) while the second became another constant, meaning that it is being assumed the unknown force does not change between tests. Because the experimental equation is simply the theoretical equation with its parts moved around and some values plugged in for its components, the two should be the same or nearly the same. The added constant on the end of the theoretical equation is intended to describe the overall error of all the trials. If this were a perfect experiment the outside forces would be equal to 0. 
The enhanced theoretical equation ($a=\frac{f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$ more closely resembles what may happen experimentally. While it is found in the same way as seen above through the demonstrated arithmetic, it keeps C1 and C2 as their component, variable parts. This allows for generalizing the equation to systems of different masses or unknown forces, rather than just the system we were testing. Just as in the other experimental model, the added unknown force in the equation allow for systematic error to be taken into account. The larger the constant is, the larger the systematic error is. This is taken into account as to allow the graph to have its true trendline and provided an explanation for why the acceleration of some systems may not match up directly to the known applied force.
Random errors may result from giving the system an additional force when released or from picking parts on the computer generated graph of the trials that weren’t perfectly linear.

Because both of these errors have a human component to them and humans aren’t perfect and will make mistakes, the best way to combat these errors is to do many more trials for each set of conditions as this will cause the mean value for these trials to approach the true value. 

Some systematic errors could result from the air not being distributed properly through the track resulting in a small amount of kinetic friction, friction between the pulley and the string, and the device recording data could be off. There is not much that can be done to correct this other than to improve the equipment used to collect the data.

If the string had an appreciable mass then there would not be uniform acceleration because when the hanging mass gets closer to the floor then the string lengthens then more mass is under the influence of gravity.
