conclusion:
In this lab, we tested the factor of hanging mass to see if it had effect on the acceleration of the cart. We held the mass of the cart the same and changed up the hanging mass each time. We then plotted our data into a table and then graphed the results. We came up with a mathematical model and found the behavior of the system to be impacted by the hanging mass. The greater the hanging mass , the greater the acceleration. In lab 06, we did the same experiment, but we had a forward tilt at ¼ inch , ½ inch and ¾ inch. The numerical values were in a similar trend to our previous lab with the positive slope.
b.) The 3 experiment our group did led to the resulting of our mathematical models since we tested our hanging mass versus the acceleration. We got out mathematical models in the from C1F+C2. C1 and C2 were simply the changes of our dependent variable, C2 was random factors made by other forces. This was seen in our graphs above representing the data we got during our experiments. C1 was 1/the mass system.
This group got acceleration increasing as tilt increases     This group got as friction increased, a decreased
These results help contribute to the understanding of my mathematical model since the first group got the same results as we did , we both did forward tilt. The second groups data made perfect sense since friction opposes the motion of the object therefore decreasing the acceleration.
A potential way to improve our experiments would be to average a larger amount of trial runs to reduce the amount of random error instead of just using 3 trials and taking the average of them. This would improve a future similar experiment.
e.)The constraints were that the forward tilt had to be ¼ to ½ to ¾ inch.
f.) The two experimental mathematical models are consistent with Newton’s second law since you can use Newton’s second law as $a=C1 F + C2$ in which we did for our models.
