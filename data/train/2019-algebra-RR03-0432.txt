discussion and conclusion:

the research question being investigated is “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?”. during each experiment we tested different independent variables to see if they would affect the pendulum period. during the first experiment of length of string as the independent variable, we predicted that this would affect the pendulum of the period. this turned out to prove true, and you can see with the graph that was made a correlation of the longer the string, the longer the pendulum periods would get. with the mass and the angle being independent variables in relation to the how it impacts the period of the pendulum, after doing the experiments the results and the graphs show how there is no correlation with the angles and masses relating to the pendulum of the period. you can see from both of the graphs that no correlation is achieved, and the graphs vary in times of periods. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of the pendulum is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ t is time, l is length of string, and g is acceleration due to gravity. after completing our graph mathematical equation, we achieved an equation of       $y=2.108 x^{0.433}$              r2 value of 0.9955. the difference is that we don’t have gravity in our equation. our data of the length of the string independent variable fits this model because of the values we achieved. the angle and mass do not fit this model, and you can see the difference in the graphs that would compare, because the length of the string is a power graph compared to the other graphs with no correlation. some errors were with the photogate, we could not get it to read every time so we would consistently have to reset it. some constraints with the setup of the experiment would be the length of the string could not go pass 200cm, so the mathematical model is generalized to certain pendulum lengths.
