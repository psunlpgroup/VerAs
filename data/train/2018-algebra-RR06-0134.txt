	the model determined from the data appears to be a good approximation of the relationship between force and acceleration. based on the equation $f=m a$ the model should be of the form $a=\frac{f}{m}$, where m represents the system mass. the system mass was determined to be 0.8124kg. therefore, 1/m is 5.4825, which is not far from the estimated slope, 5.1898. this discrepancy may be due in part to systematic error from assuming no friction. especially where the hanging mass is small and the mass on the cart is high, friction may be non-negligible, causing us to underestimate the force. in addition, the hanging mass was connected to the cart by a string with mass. this mass was ignored in establishing the model, but in reality, the mass of this string would contribute to the hanging mass. as the mass falls, the force increases, and acceleration will not be uniform. it will increase over time. this is not reflected in the model.
