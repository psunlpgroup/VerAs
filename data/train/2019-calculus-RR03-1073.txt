Conclusion:
 The overall research question under investigation is, what factors effect the time it takes for one swing of a pendulum. For test one, we changed the amount of weight on the end of the pendulum and kept all other factors constant and we measure the time it took to swing once, although we predicted that the weight would affect the time, it actually remains constant. The next one is test two, we changed the angle at which we dropped the pendulum weight, we changed the angle and measured the amount of time for one swing keeping all other variables constant, we predicted that the angle would not affect the Tim e and it turned out that it did in fact not affect the time. For the final test, test three, we changed the length of string used for the pendulum and measured the amount of time it took to swing once keeping all other variables constant, we predicted that length of string would affect the time it takes to swing and as it turns out, it does. For time vs string length, the function $y=0.0153 x + 0.618$ describes the time it takes the pendulum to swing for any weight that you plug into it, you can also reverse this and find the length of the string for a certain time. This function has a very small margin of error because a much more accurate way of measuring the time was used. As seen in the graphs the weight and angle graph have a slope of 0 meaning the time is the same no matter what we change for it, but for the length of string graph there is a constant slope that creates an equation. There are some errors within this experiment, for the first week of measurements and graphs, the graph is very rough because there is a random error that is included when using people the measure, As seen by the last graph, when a machine is used to measure the time it takes for one swing of the pendulum, the outcome is much more accurate and for the most part any error would be systematic. Overall the final graph and data points are the most accurate and reflect the data the best.
