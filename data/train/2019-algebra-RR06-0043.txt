conclusion:

	the research question was what factors can impact the acceleration of a system. the experiment with the hanging weight made the applied force the independent variable, with the controls being the mass of the system and the tilt of the track. the acceleration of the system was found to increase with the force applied. the data generated a linear graph and the error bars do not overlap which indicates that the change in data was due to something other than chance or random error. two other groups obtained comparable results, with the relationship between the applied force and acceleration generating a positive linear graph that indicated a direct relationship when accounting for standard error. the theoretical equation for acceleration $f=m a$. our mathematical model  supports this relationship and the high r^2 value of the best fit line of our data indicates that it correlates strongly. the results also correlated with the enhanced mathematical model and two variable equations.

	due to the set up of this experiment there were very few sources of random error, and that is reflected in the consistency of the data. a possible random error could be inadvertently pushing the system as it is released, however if that occurred it did not impact the linear relationship between the variables so it is unlikely. systematic error is possible, however unlikely especially as our data correlates closely with the conclusions drawn by the other groups.  

	major constraints of this experiment include the inability to measure and account for friction and air resistance. though these did not impact our results because they were kept constant by performing all experiments in the same environment, it does impact our ability to generalize these results as these unmeasured factors may vary and could lead to different results if this experiment was carried out in another environment.
