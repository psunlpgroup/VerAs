conclusion:
The purpose of these two labs were similar but the exact design of the labs was different. For lab 005 the purpose of the lab was to see what variables in the system affected the acceleration of the system. For example, in two different experiments we changed the hanging force and the mass of the cart while keeping all other variables similar. By doing so we were able to find two different mathematical models by using the line of best fit once we plotted the data points from both labs. This gives us an ideal of what the real equation of the system is, but this is without friction which is simulated by the air flow under the cart as well was the system not having any incline. Refer to figures 1 and 2 to see the equations. These are the forms they are supposed to take respectively $A=C1 F-c2$ and then $A=C1 M+C2$ for experiments 1 &2. A represents the acceleration, F represents the force and C1 and C2 are constants. To study this, we looked at lab 006 to answer questions about how the friction and incline affected the real equation.
 The purpose of lab 006 was to test what variables on a system outside the system itself such as the incline or the friction of the system had on the acceleration of the system and by default the equation of the system. The variable our group tested was the affect of forward tilt on the acceleration of the system. Our equation we developed was $A=C1 F+C2$. Though we did not come up with a different equation because of the forward tilt we kept the same equation as the hanging force as evident by figures 3,4 and 5. The equation changed with the forward tilt increasing C2 as the incline became steeper which means the system was accelerating at a faster rate. 
 The final mathematical model that we came up with is modeled after A and this was based on the hanging force equation developed earlier in lab 005 as represented in figure 2. While we were seeing how the forward incline was affecting the constants of the system in lab 006, we were reassured that out equation was correct. The exact equation for lab 005 experiment 2 was $y=2.5837 x+0.028$. This equation was obtained by testing 4 different hanging forces on the system to see what the relationship between the hanging forces was and the acceleration of the system. This equation shows us that when an incline is relatively flat the C2 constant is small. In lab 006 experiments 3,4, and 5 we obtained 3 different equations because there were three different conditions to which each of the experiments occurred. For lab 006 experiment 3 the plane was inclined by 0.25” and this caused the equation to be $y=2.6444 x+0.0496$. for lab 006 experiment 4 the plane was inclined by 0.50” and this caused the equation to be $y=2.5908 x+0.0856$. for lab 006 experiment 5 the plane was inclined by 0.75” and this caused the equation to be $y=2.6518 x+0.1005$. So, we can conclude that as the inclined increased the C2 increased as well just as my group predicted.  In lab 005 experiment 1 the equation was different from the other experiments because it was a negative power relationship. The equation which we saw from figure 1 was $y=0.3526 x-0.881$. So just as we predicted with the mass of the cart increasing it slows down the acceleration of the system.
