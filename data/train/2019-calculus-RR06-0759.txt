conclusion and discussion:

the purpose of the labs was to see how the acceleration of a system would change when a factor was changed. for our lab05 we changed the mass of the two different objects and then developed models for how the two objects changing in mass affect the acceleration of the system. then in our lab06 we tested how changing the backwards tilt of the track would affect the change in acceleration when changing the mass of object 1 to object 2 by transferring the bobbers.

for our first experiment in lab05 we used our data and our graph to make the linear relationship that gave us the model of $a=0.0026 m2 + 0.0171$. this model was a good fit for our graph (1. graph lab 05) since all our data points seemed to line up and resulted in a high r squared value which made it great for a linear fit. for our second experiment in lab05 we used our data and our graph to make the exponential relationship that gave us the model of $a=838.04 m1-1.15$. this model was a good fit for our graph (3. graph lab 05) since all our data points tended to line up which made it a great fit and resulted in a high r squared value. for our second experiment we got one mathematical model for each different tilt value that we tested. our three models all seemed to have an appropriate linear fit which was seen in all three graphs (4.,5, 6. graphs lab 06) by their low r squared values. the first and last models (4. and 6. graphs lab 06) we obtained in order of increasing tilt were is  $a = 0.0032 m2 g– 0.1731$ and $a = 0.003 m2g - 0.1734$.
in all three of our experiments we can conclude that the greater the hanging mass the more the acceleration will increase. our first graph in lab05 gave us the model of $a=0.0026 m2 g + 0.0171$. the hanging weight was referred to object 2 in our experiment. we also considered the extremely small error bars which were .05g*9.82m/s^2 which is.491 for the x axis due to .1g being the most specific measurement for the scale and we multiplied it by the acceleration of gravity for the first experiment. we also had an error bar of .001m/s^2 for the y axis due to the measuring of the pulley system accuracy. due to the lack of overlap in error bars in our first graph with the hanging mass as the independent variable we can conclude that our model is correct in the sense that as the hanging mass increases the acceleration will also increase according to our model.
present (photo of the other groups’ whiteboard is fine) and discuss the findings of at least two other groups from work completed in lab 06.  discuss how the results of these groups contribute to your understanding of what the numerical values in your mathematical model(s) might represent. remember that these other sources of data must be cited properly; such as by group #.  
i didn’t get data from our class because we lost the pictures, so i used some that a friend got from their class i hope this is ok if not you don’t have to grade this portion.
this group tested how friction would affect the acceleration and they observed that the greater the friction that there would be a decrease in acceleration. this was clearly seen as the increased number of magnets from 0 to 6 caused the acceleration to go from .454m/s^2 to .298m/s^2. this proved their conclusion that the increase in friction will cause the acceleration to decrease.
this group claimed that there was a relationship between friction and acceleration. this can be easily observed as the number of magnets went from 0 to 6 and then the acceleration went from -.5m/s^2 to -.312m/s^2. this proves their conclusion that as the friction increases the acceleration will decrease.
a systematic error in the lab could have been due to an error in our scale which could have been outputting slightly incorrect masses. this error could be fixed by measuring with multiple scales and taking the average. also, another systematic error could have been in our air track if there was any lack of lift from the air. this could be fixed by doing trials on multiple tracks and taking the average of the trials. a random error could have been due to the person releasing the cart could have applied different levels of resistance for each release which could have been prevented if we had a system that automatically released the cart. another random error in the experiment could have been the starting distance of the cart which could have slightly affected the weight due to string being on the track. this could have been prevented if we chose a specific starting point for each experiment.
some major constraints of our experiment were things that we could not control. such as, we didn’t all have bobbers that were the same mass and all the bobbers had slightly different masses which would make it hard to generalize any of our results. another main constraint was that our system did not have an automatic release function which made it so the person releasing the cart could accidentally apply an unwanted force. also, we did not have a system to time the release of the cart with the system so we could have started too early which could have made it difficult to find what data was incorrect and what was correct.

the theoretical model was $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ which was consistent with our mathematical model $a=c1 w+c2$ and for us that model was c1 is .0026 and c2 is 0.0171. so, for this equation the force is determined by $a = 0.0026 m g +0.0171$. this model supports the theoretical formula because it accounts for the. the enhanced equation is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ this is very fitting for our equation because it accounts for the external forces of the system which is essentially the error due to the lab setup.

if there was a heavy string attaching the two objects, the weight would be transferred from the cart to the hanging object as the experiment continued which would cause there to be an exponential increase in the acceleration. if we look at lab05 in our second experiment (3. graph for lab05) for the mass of object 1 (the cart) increasing, we got the model of $a=838.04 m1-1.15$. this showed that the increase of mass for object 1 would cause an exponential relationship. therefore, if the string weight increased it would show that as more string passed over the edge the acceleration would increase exponentially.
