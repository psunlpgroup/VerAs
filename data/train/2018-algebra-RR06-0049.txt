conclusions

the acceleration changes as the applied force changes is linear, this is proved by the testable equation $f=a m$. this concept is taken from newtonâ€™s second law stating that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon the two variables, net force acting on the object and the mass of the object. this reasoning is based on the consistent mass of the object and the hanging mass which is acting on the object on an air track, reducing friction. the constraints of this model are only determined in lab 6. when given a predetermined acceleration can the hanging mass be found? yes, the equation given was used and values found in lab 5 were inputted into it to find the hanging mass. this would have been successful if all calculations in lab 5 were determined properly. this would have shown a linear relationship with conclusive results.
