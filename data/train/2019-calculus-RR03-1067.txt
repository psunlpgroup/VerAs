discussion and conclusion

this experiment was to figure out the possible factor which would affect the period of pendulum. we tested threes possible factors is  length of the string, the mass of the pendulum and the amplitude of release. in first stage of experiment (first lab class), researchers only did one times in each trial and used stopwatch. the standard deviaton, calculated by the data shown in table 4, was 0.04669. in the mass vs time part, we kept length of string was 59 cm and the amplitude of release was 30 degree. in the figure 1, we applied the linear model on the graph (from table 1) and get $y=0.0013 x + 1.204$ and   r^2 is 0.3964. r^2 was really small, which means the linear correlation was not significant. after applying the error bar on it, we could find that periods on different mass were always overlapping. data with error bar with 250g mass and 90g mass are overlapping. also, data sometimes showed an incline trend and sometimes showed a decline trend. these results demonstrated that the mass of object did not affect the period of pendulum. in the angle vs time part, we kept the length of string was 59 cm and the mass of object was 90g. in the figure 2, we applied the linear model on the graph (from table 2) and get $y=0.0161 x + 0.5466$    and r^2 is 0.9404. the data showed there was a positive linear correlation as length increasing at 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, 60cm shows without any overlapping. these results suggested there was a positive correlation between length of string and period of pendulum. in the angle vs time part, we kept the amplitude of release was 30 degree and the mass of object was 90g. in the figure 3, we applied the linear model on the graph (from table 3) and get $y=0.0115 x + 1.024$      and r^2 is 0.9332. when the range of angle was 20-40 degree, data would overlap. overall, there was still an incline relationship between amplitude of release and the period of pendulum.

	in first stage, researchers thought that the mass of object would not affect the period of pendulum. and, the other two factors is  amplitude of release and length of string need further investigation. using the stopwatch random error, since human could not be very accurate on recording time. we would use laser counter and do multiple trials to reduce the error. period would be the interval between object’s first and second breaking the laser.

in the second stage (third lab class), we only dealt with amplitude of release and length of string and in each trial, we do three times to get average results. in length vs time part, data have been shown in table 5. and in the figure 4, we found top opening parabola best fitted this curve is  $y=0.2003 x^{0.5008}$ r2 is 0.9999. r^2 showed this result was significant. function  could explained this result. l^0.5 was equivalent to x^0.5008. and, 2π/g^0.5 is constant in natural which is 2.007. it was close enough to our result. the scalar bar was very small, and the data did not overlap with each other. in length vs time part, data have been shown in table 6. and in the figure 5, we found polynomial curve, $y=\frac{4 x^{2}}{e^{0.5}} - 0.0007 x$*2-0.0007x + 1.4607,     r^2 is 0.995, best fitted the curve. the r^2 showed this result was significant. however, we don't know the principle of getting this result. in the following research, we will read more literature to find the reason. the scalar bar was very small, and the data did not overlap with each other.

	there are still some constraints besides human influence such as shaking of string. when we drop the object on a relatively large amplitude, the strings may shake. this is a random error. when we only do each trial once, it will seriously affect our results. i guess the standard deviation will become very large and the data will overlap.
