discussion/conclusion:

the purpose of this lab is to develop a mathematical model for acceleration and applied force through an experiment that will compare to a hypothetical model. the research question being investigated is if changing the hanging mass will affect the acceleration of the block in the system. the experiment performed was on the basis of newtonâ€™s laws, the hanging mass becomes the applied force when calculated through the gravitational acceleration which is assumed constant. through this experiment a mathematical model was developed, shown in graph 1, with values of $y=2.9598 x - 0.017$ which is a linear relationship comparing acceleration with force as predicted. comparing our results with the results of others it was concluded that the mathematical model was similar to that of others and therefore the mathematical model is supported through other data collected. when comparing the theoretical model to the experimental value it can be seen that the theoretical model does not consider other forces acting on the system. mass is not shown in the experimental model, but the model can be used to calculate mass when acceleration is calculated from the experimental model. the string will not affect the uniform acceleration regardless if it has a viable mass or not. the only thing that the string affects is the rate at which the block accelerates. in the experiment it was stated that the datastudio tool had random error when collecting data for acceleration this can be reduced if the slope chosen from the graph contains minimal error meaning it is as straight as it can be. another source of error is systematic error of the balance when measuring mass of the objects. this can be reduced by calibrating the balance and measuring the mass to the nearest unit.
