discussion/conclusion



	as a reminder, this experiment was used to show whether adjusting the force generated by the hanging mass would affect the acceleration in which the cart would go. in the first experiment, a total of 8 trials were completed where the force of the hanging mass was increased every time. this resulted in an increase in acceleration for each 1 out of the 8 trials. there should be none if not very little random error since a computer measured all the functions for the group. the only random error that could have occurred is the incorrect measuring of the bobbers on the scale. the only error that could have occurred would have been systematic, and the initial setup was incorrect. the effect of force on acceleration graph shows a linear representation of the data, insuring that very little errors had occurred. the second experiment used a greater system mass, however, was found to have followed the same principles as the first experiment.
