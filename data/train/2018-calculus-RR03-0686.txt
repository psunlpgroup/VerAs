conclusion and discussion:



in this lab we were to experiment with and determine the different factors which affect the period of a pendulum at small swings.  in lab one, on the 28th of august, we collected data on three independent variables which we thought could impact the period of a pendulum.  those three variables included the mass of the pendulum, the angle of release of the pendulum, and the length of the pendulum.  the collected data was put into data tables 01, 02, and 03 respectively.  additionally the data was plotted and graphed with a line of best fit.  based on the graphs we are able to believe that neither the mass of a pendulum nor the angle of release of a pendulum affect the period of said pendulum at small swings.  by looking at graph 01 we can see that a perfectly horizontal line can be drawn between the error bars.  this means, that it is not for certain, but very probable, that the period of the pendulum was unchanged as the mass of the pendulum increased.  in graph 02 the uncertainty, error bars, overlap greatly but not perfectly throughout the whole graph.  four out of the five points overlap with uncertainty so it is also very probable that the period of the pendulum doesn’t change as the angle of release changes.  large human errors such as reaction speed or timing errors may have played a part in the fifth point not overlapping.  these errors could have been reduced with more timings and averaging the collected date.  the third graph, graph 03, shows the effects that the length of a pendulum has on the period.  in this graph none of the error bars overlap, strongly hinting that the period of the pendulum increased as the length of the pendulum increased.  additionally graph 04 which also focused on the impact of pendulum length begins to take a less linear form than previous graphs.  this trend also helps aid to the idea that length does indeed affect the period of a pendulum. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is $t=2\pi \sqrt\frac{l}{g}$.  through simplifying this equation we can convert it to $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ which is equal to $t=2.007 l^{0.5}$.  this equation is a power equation which is also the type of equation we conducted from our experiment.  our equation was $t=0.8699 x^{0.5156}$ which had an r^2 value of exactly one when the line of best fit was calculated on graph 04.  our calculated exponential power was very accurate however our leading constant was not.  random and systematic errors could have played a part in this calculation. some examples of random errors include reaction speed, timing error, flawed angle of release, swaying of the pendulum, air resistance, and mathematical mistakes.  these errors and their impact can be limited by taking more timings or readings and then averaging the collected data.  systematic errors could have been flawed instruments such as a not balanced triple beam balance, a tape measure that was off by a few increments, a lagged stopwatch or even a poorly designed protractor.  these errors can only be fixed by making sure the equipment used was calibrated correctly. restraints also can affect the accuracy of our data.  some factors include time, because we couldn’t stay as long as we wanted and take more data, and the equipment we were given.  simple stopwatches, protractors and measuring tapes get the job done but not to the best of the abilities, so improving the materials given could help make sure the data collected is as accurate as it can be.
