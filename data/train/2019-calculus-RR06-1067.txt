discussion and conclusion

this experiment is to determine what factors could affect the acceleration of motion. we listed three possible factors is  mass of whole system, mass of hanging and magnetic force. in the first experiment, we kept the mass of hanging, air push and distance of start (1.1m). this hanging mass was 39.1g. the total mass of cart (object) and fishing bobs was 342.7g, and we added 50 g in each time. the data was shown in table 1. the figure 1 showed that when the mass of cart increased, the acceleration decreased. the mathematical model was power curve is  $y=\frac{216.31}{x^{0.929}}$. the r^2 is 0.9982, which means the result was significant. the result proved the hypothesis and prediction of experiment 1. in the second experiment, we determined how the mass of hanging changed the acceleration. the initial mass was 54g, adding one fishing bob in each time. the data was shown in table 2. the whole system’s mass did not change and kept 342.7g. the distance of start was 1.10m. the figure 2 showed that when the mass of hanging increased, the acceleration increased. the mathematical model was linear is  $y=0.0254 x - 0.027$. the r^2 is 1, which means the result was significant. the result proved the hypothesis and prediction of experiment 2. the error bar did not make any overlapping happen.

in the experiment 3, the mass of whole system was 471g with two magnets and the distance of start was 0.8m. the x in the table and graph represented the mass of hanging. in part a, there was no magnetic force acted on the track. the data was shown in table 3. according to the figure 3, it appeared a linear model is  $y=18.729 x-0.0221$. r^2 is 0.9997, which means the result is significant. in the part b, there was one piece of magnetic force acted on the track. the data was shown in table 4. according to the figure 4, it appeared a linear model is  $y=18.202 x-0.0264$. r^2 is 0.9996, which means the result is significant. in the part c, there was two pieces of magnetic force acted on the track. the data was shown in table 5. according to the figure 5, it appeared a linear model is  $y=18.202 x-0.0264$. r^2 is 0.9996, which means the result is significant. the error bar did not make any overlapping happen. so, increasing the magnetic attraction would decrease the acceleration, which supported our predication. 

from the previous result, we could find the mathematical model of mass of whole system and acceleration was power curve. and when we determined how the mass of hanging affect the acceleration, the model was linear, whether there was magnetic force or not. so, we are back to the newtown’s third law is  $f=m a$. the acceleration should be equal to the net force over the whole system’s mass. 

for the experiment 1, f should be composed gravity of fishing bobs, which was fixed in this experiment, and the force from air push is  $f+g=m a$. so, $a=\frac{f+g}{m}$, $a=\frac{f+g}{m}$. the f was from the air push friction which is fixed. when fishing bobs was hanging, the gravity drived bobs going down. one heavy string connected the fishing bob with the cart, and when bobs were gong down, the cart moved forward. so the gravity acted on the cart and affected the acceleration. we used g or gfishing bobs to represent this force. the prediction of the acceleration was $a=\frac{f+g}{m}$ . mass of whole system without fishing bobs would be x. in the linear equation is  $y=\frac{216.31}{x^{0.929}}$, y represented the acceleration. we could find the equation we get was very similar to theoretical mathematical models. -0.929 approximately was close to -1. and 216.31 was fixed as f (air push) +g (fishing bobs.)

for the experiment 2, g should be the gravity of fishing bobs which was mass of fishing bobs is  g is 9.8m. $a=\frac{f+ g m}{m_{sys}}$. , this could be a ideal model. the theoretical model could convert to $a=\frac{g m}{m_{sys}}$ so c1 equaled to (1/ mwhole system), and c2 equaled to gfishing bobs/mwhole system. c2 is different with c1 which the unit should be m/s2. the equation of experiment was $y=0.0254 x - 0.027$, but the x represented only mass of the fishing bobs. so, 1/ mwhole system * g should be the coefficient of x. which is 0.029,which was close to our actual value is  0.0254. c2 is negative, which could be regard as the effect of resistance on the acceleration. the unit of mass of equation and calculation in experiment 2 were all in gram.  

for the experiment 3, the mass of whole system was increased to 0.471kg. the unit was all in kg. so, the coefficient of x had to change to $\frac{9.8}{0.471} = 20.81$. the three equations were is  $y=18.729 x-0.0221$, $y=18.202 x-0.0264$, $y=18.202 x-0.0334$. the coefficients between each other were not much different and were close enough to our theoretical values. then, we compared the c2 is  -0.0221, -0.0264, -0.0334. as the magnets were adding on the lower part of cart, c2 decreased, which became more negative. this result showed that the attraction between cart and track by magnetic force would increase the resistance of motion. $c2=\frac{f}{m}$. the m of whole system was fixed, which means the magnetic force effected the f. our conclusion was that increasing magnetic attraction on air track would decrease the acceleration. 

the group 2 also did some similar work as we did. their hypothesis was that the acceleration of the cat would decrease as the force of the magnetic field on the cart increases. they also got three equations is  $y=3.3746 x+1.0154$, $y=3.9225 x-1.9154$, $y= 4.295 x-7.2733$. however, their x actually represented the number of bobs, so when we calculated c1, we should consider about the individual weight of each bulb. their acceleration`s unit was rad/s^2. their c2 were is  1.0154, -1.9154, and -7.2733. as the magnet added, the c2 decrease. their conclusion supported our conclusion is  as the force of the magnetic field on the cart increases, the acceleration of the cart decreases. 

	the figure 6 showed the work of group 3 and 4. unlike us, they decided to pull up the hanging end of track to make an incline. group 3 got three equations is  $a=0.2.8853 f-0.0132$, $a=9423 f-0.0847$, and $a=2.913 f-0.1411$. their c2 values went from -.0132, to -.0847, to -.1411. we found when the height of incline increased, the c2 was more negative, which meant the resistance to motion was bigger. group 4’s data supported their conclusion. 

	there were some errors in the whole experiment. the software we used to record acceleration had random error is  0.001. it was two-side error and did not causing any overlap in the graph. so, this random error may affect the acceleration, but this affection was very limited. there also had systemic error on the weighing process about positive 0.6g. this was also a systemic error which would not affect the results. 

	we also concerned about some constraints within the experiment. we only record one track in every parts of experiment. only one track might have its own effect on the experiment. if we could use multiple tracks, we would generalize the results.
