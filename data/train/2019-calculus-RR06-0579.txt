conclusion:
 the purpose of the lab was to determine the effect of friction on acceleration we did this by using the mathematical models we got from our tests

 after the test in the first experiment we determined that the graph was linear and used excel to create a mathematical model and the model is used to calculate acceleration from force. the second experiments data looked exponential, so we used the data to create a model and the model is used to find acceleration form the mass being applied. the final experiment was linear, so we made a linear model and when friction is plugged in to the model the acceleration is outputted. 

 

the other two groups just confirmed out finding by having vary similar results.

our constraints were the distance we could travel, the time we had to collect data and the force being applied.

$f = m a$, $a =\frac{f}{m}$ and as out graphs showed as mass increased the acceleration decreased.
