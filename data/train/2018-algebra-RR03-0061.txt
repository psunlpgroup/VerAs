discussion and conclusion:

after looking at the graphs with the error bars and r2 values you notice that there is no significant relationship between time vs. angle and time vs. mass. this is shown in the graphs above because a horizontal line can be drawn through the error bars. theoretically this means for any angle/mass you should get approximately the same time. for length however, you cannot draw a horizontal line through the error bars meaning you should get a different number for each period. looking at the r2 value you notice that it close to .99 (meaning a linear relationship) but still not close enough. to determine the model that best fits time vs. length, data with less random errors was obtained. using photogate, to reduce errors brought on by the stopwatch, a new set of data was acquired. the data is shown in figure 4.  error bars were then added but cannot be seen because the uncertainty value is .001 and the graph isnâ€™t scaled small enough. now the true relationship was shown, it best fits a $y=x^{2}$ curve. the true equation for our graph is shown as $t=0.35389$. we were able to compare this equation to the actual mathematical model for period of a small swing. this equation being $t=\frac{2 \sqrt{l}}{\sqrt{g}}$. typing 10 into each equation would get you .634s for the mathematical model and .864 for the experimental model. considering the small uncertainty value these the lab data does not support the mathematical model. this could be due to random or systematic errors. for starters the length was measured was in cm but the mathematical is in m. even with the conversion it still did not match up hinting that some unknown errors were happening. in conclusion, it was determined that the mass and angle of a pendulum do not affect the period of a small swing but there is a relationship between length of the string and time. although this cannot be for certain since the experimental equation did not fit the mathematical model.
