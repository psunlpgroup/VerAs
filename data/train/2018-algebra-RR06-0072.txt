discussion/conclusion

	in labs 5 and 6, the purpose was to determine how acceleration of a system was affected when applied force (hanging mass) was changed. our research question was, “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?” this was analyzed by using different hanging masses, our independent variable, to see how the acceleration of the system changed, our dependent variable. after graphing our data, shown in graph 1, it is easy to see that there was a significant difference between hanging mass and acceleration of the system. this is because the slope is positive, which indicates a positive correlation between hanging mass and acceleration of the system. not only is the correlation proved by our data, it is also proved by the data obtained from group 5 and 6. in figure 1, which depicts data from group 5, you are also able to see a graph with a positive slope depicting a positive correlation between hanging mass and acceleration of the system. in figure 2, which depicts data from group 6, you are again able to see a graph with a positive slope, which also is depicting a positive correlation between hanging mass and acceleration of the system. figure 2 also gave an equation that was similar to ours. their equation is as follows is  $y=0.0533 x + 0.0156$. this is very comparable to what we found our equation to be. the mx portion of the equation is the slope and the y-intercept is the amount of friction involved. as friction increases, your slope will increase because you need a little more force to have the car overcome friction to accelerate. with all of the data from group 5 and 6, we are in full agreement with their results. 

	the theoretical equation, for acceleration based on a single force, given to us was is  $a_{sys}=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ . the experimental mathematical model was $y=0.0446 x + 0.0125$. this was very comparable to the theoretical equation. the theoretical equation, for acceleration based on more than one force, given to us was is  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ . the experimental mathematical model was comparable to the theoretical model because gravity and friction was accounted for. 

	when we were faced with the challenge portion of lab 6, we used our equation derived from lab 5 to help us succeed in finding the correct amount of weight needed to reach the acceleration given by our ta (0.5m/s2). we predicted that as hanging mass increases, the acceleration of the car will also increase. in figure 3, it depicts the mathematical solving methods we used to figure out what amount of mass to hang from the string in order for the system to reach the given acceleration. we came up with a total mass of 21.82g. this exact mass was very difficult to achieve because we did not have many supplies to work with. with that being said, our acceleration was not exactly 0.5m/s2, but it was a close 0.642 m/s2. 

	there was one major constraint during labs 5 and 6. this was friction. friction was indicated as the y-intercept in the equation depicted on graph 1. friction can affect generalizability within results, but you cannot completely negate it. the friction was between the track and the car. 

	random error was not a huge problem during labs 5 and 6. this is because a lot of our “timing” and “measuring” came from data studio. the only potential for random error was when the person was releasing the system, and how well the bobbers were attached to the system. if a bobber was not well attached and dragged along the track with the car, this could have increased friction and decreased acceleration, which would skew results. luckily, we watched out for this and it did not occur.
