discussion/conclusion

this experiment was run in order to test which variables affect the period of a pendulum including mass, angle, and length of string. for the first experiment the mass was tested. the hypothesis was that the mass would not affect the period length. 5 trials were run with increasing masses. each trial seemed to barely if at all affect the period. once the data was graphed and the r-squared value was obtained, it was apparent that mass had no effect on the period of a pendulum. the next variable tested was the angle if release. the hypothesis tested was that the angle also had no effect on the period of the pendulum. once again 5 trials were run with increasing angles but constant mass and string length. the graph created from this data showed no correlation between angle and period. finally, the last variable tested was length of string. 6 trials were run for this experiment. string lengths ranging from 10cm to 190cm were used. the graph of this data showed that there is in fact a correlation between length of string and period. the high r-squared value proves our hypothesis as well. the equation that was calculated for the graph was 0.285x0.4319. when using the theoretical equation for a period,  the value of 0.285 is pretty close. the answer wasnâ€™t perfect which can be attributed to random errors such not being able to judge exactly where the end of a period is, having a delayed or to quick reaction time on the stopwatch, or not being able to get an exact angle measurement. to avoid these errors, more measurements need to be taken. possible systematic errors in the experiment include the tape measure used to get the string length could have been stretched from extended use or the weights used at the end of the pendulum could have been improperly recorded due to the scale being off. to reduce the systematic errors a motion stopwatch can be used or an electronic scale to ensure the masses are correct.
