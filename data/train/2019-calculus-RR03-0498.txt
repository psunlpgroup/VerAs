conclusion:

The essential purpose or question of this entire lab experiment is to accurately understand and learn about uncertainties in data as well as how to create mathematical models such as the graphs and data charts above, however, the question itself is to find and understand between the independent and dependent variables in the pendulum. There were 3 main variables in this experiment as previously stated the first of which would be the angle of release this was tested as an independent variable along with all the other variables by changing the angle for different tests while keeping the mass and length of string constant. The angle of release was answered by using that process of test, retest, repeat. It is answered through thorough testing and from the data of other groups that supported our data saying the angle does not affect the pendulum. This is true as well for mass, after further testing we understood only the length of the string was a major factor that affected the pendulum and once again this was supported by other groups as well as our teacher who confirmed this process by approval of hypothesis and end results. The theoretical equation we used to find period of the pendulum was Tim$e=2 \sqrt{2} \pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$. After plugging in data and gathering from the graph above and plug in .50m we get $T=1.5$ seconds and this matches up with out data making it reasonable to predict. Finally we go over all the constraints of this experiment which were not numerous there were very few one being the first test we could not use anything but a stopwatch to calculate periods and to reduce the possible error here we had 2 people use the stopwatches and took the average of the two timers results for each period and this made our data significantly more accurate. This was the biggest and most important constraint for the experiment, however due to this constraint we had much more accurate data and therefore it really improved our results and did not affect us too negatively.
