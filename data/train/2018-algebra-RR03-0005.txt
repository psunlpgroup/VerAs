Conclusion:
we investigate in this lab what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. the three experiments helped in addressing this research question by doing the experiment to test each variable to make sure if it affects the period of pendulum or does not. as we can see in graph 1 the angel of release does not affect the period of pendulum because the error bars overlap completely. in graph 2, we know that increasing the mass will decrease the period of pendulum slightly. in graph 3, we see that increasing the length of string increases the period of pendulum. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is  sqrt (l/g) this explain how the period of pendulum affected by the length of string. my data fit this model because my base for the equation is around 2.0 and my power is around 0.5. some errors that were presented in this experiment are missing counting one of the swing, using a wrong angle of release, and not stopping the timer at 10 seconds exactly. we reduced these errors by letting one person to count the swing, so she can count them correctly, making sure that the angle is correct by measuring it several times, and letting one person focus on time so we can stop at 10 second exactly. i do not think there are any constrain in this experiment that limit the generalization of my data and results.   $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$
