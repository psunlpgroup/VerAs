discussion and conclusion

	during lab 05 we were asked to relate the acceleration and the applied force to newton’s law. to do this we asked the question of how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. to do this we kept a constant mass of the system but changed where the mass would be located. the bobs used would either be on the gold cart or hanging off a string as the applied force testing how fast the cart would move. by doing this we got the following experimental model equation of $y=5.3103 x - 0.0161$. the relationship of this can be seen in “figure 1 is  graph of acceleration vs hanging force.” this equation comes from how fast the acceleration is compared to the mass of the applied force on the cart. 

	while we were conducting this experiment, two other groups were also conducting the same experiment. in group 3, they had made the same hypothesis we did, that the applied force will affect the acceleration of the system. their data collected is shown above in “table 4 is  group 3 data from experimental design.” afterwards, they found they had a experimental model equation of $y=5.0587 x - 0.0419$. this equation and their data supports our claim, of the applied force affecting the acceleration. meanwhile, group 2 was testing their hypothesis of, “if the force applied to the system increases then the acceleration of the system will also increase.” the data they collected is shown above in “table 5 is  group 2 data from experimental design.” just like our data and group three’s data, it showed that the acceleration increased when more mass was in the applied force. group 2 had the experimental model equation of $y=3.897 x - 0.0255$. all our experimental model equations have the same positive linear relationship between the applied force and the acceleration. 

	our data is different from each of the other groups because all the groups had a different system mass. thus, giving us all different accelerations and experimental model equations. however, all of our data proves the same point that the greater the applied force, the greater the acceleration will be. 

	in all the experimental model equations, they follow the setup of y being the acceleration, and x being the hanging force in newtons. there is a positive constant multiplied by the hanging force, which follows the theoretical equation $a=\frac{f_{hanging}}{m_{sys}}$  newton’s equation is is  $f=m a$ or $y=c x-d$, where c and d are constants. using the experimental model equation we can derive the equation $a=\frac{f-f_{friction}}{m_{sys}}$, where c and d are the values at (1/system mass) and (friction/system mass). 

	possible forces other than the applied force that could affect the experiment would be the friction on the air track, or the air resistance between the cart and the vacuum. these forces show up in the constant negative value in the experimental model equation.
