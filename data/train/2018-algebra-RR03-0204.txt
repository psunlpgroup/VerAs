conclusion:

during the lab we experimented which independent variables didn’t affect the period, and which shouldn’t be included in the mathematical model or equation. i was absent during the first lab and switched groups during the third class; so, my data and responses may differ from my group members. upon doing the three different experiments it was made clear that the mass of the pendulum weight and the angle of drop had no effect on the period. the string length on the other hand had a high correlation between the dependent and independent variables in the experiments. although i used the online feature of the lab the data and graphs prove the claims made. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is is   where x represents the length of string measured in centimeters. when testing, there are numerous errors that could be could possibly be present in an experiment as such. a random error that commonly appeared was the measurement of string angles. since we were basically eyeballing the string angle with a protractor, the angles could’ve been off during the experiment. to fix this, we could maybe find a more efficient and accurate way to measure the angles of the string and prevent the recording of wrong measurements. a systematic error that could occur is decimal places used in experiments. making sure the use of the same number of decimal places in data collected is important when trying to keep records as accurate and precise as possible. due to my absence i was unable to experience any of the actual random and or systematic errors the team faced; as well as any constraints that may have limited results.
