conclusion:

the purpose of this lab was to develop a mathematical model for real system under a constant force and its relation to acceleration and mass. these models are used to understand the variables in a system and conceptualize what aspects of the experiment affect which numeric values in the equation $f=m a$.

two mathematical models were created in the first two experiments which both related to newton’s law $f=m a$. these models were understood as is  1)  $a = \frac{f}{m}$  $a = f m^{-1}$. the first equation is derived linearly from the  $f=m a$ equation and the variable x seen in the linear form represents the change in force applied seen in the first experiment. the second equation differs from the first equation, despite being linear, because the mass of the system was chosen as the independent variable. in this case, the variable x must be a reciprocal of mass despite the mass of the system changing throughout the trials. this yields a power equation where the variable x is raised to a negative power. developing these equations helped us test different variables in a similar system such as friction or the tilt of the track. the experiment conducted by group six has a consistent linear decrease in the y intercept, which is telling of increasing friction reducing. this confirms our understanding of the acceleration equation since the overall acceleration equation is being lowered by a random force consistent throughout five tests. in the experiment conducted by group one, the track was tilted slightly to theoretically decrease the overall force in the equation. this is consistent with our model since the tilt of the track would be discreetly slowing the acceleration. in their experiment, the higher the tilt at the pully end of the track, the lower the acceleration. this would also affect the second constant of the point slope equation $y = m x + b$. some of the errors in our experiment specifically come from the mass of our cart. since our mass wasn’t held constant between our three experiments, this could have skewed our results enough to ruin correlation to the mathematical prediction. this was a systematic error since it affected our results in a predictable fashion. some constraints of our equation may have been that our magnets could not precisely affect our acceleration. if there were a measurable metric of friction through the magnitude of the magnetic force, our tests could be more accurately compared to a theoretical model.
