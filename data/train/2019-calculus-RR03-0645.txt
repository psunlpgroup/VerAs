conclusion:
This experiment seeks to develop a mathematical model for the dependent variable of the Period (measured in time(s)) based on the independent variable of length and the controlled variables of angle and mass. Our experimental tools consisted of a photogate, string, and a weight. Our hypothesis was that the relation between pendulum length and period has a linear relationship, based on x2-x1 is v1t-1/2at2.Our prediction was that the longer the length of the pendulum, the longer the period is. This data is as displayed below.
As shown by the table, our prediction was correct. The longer the length of the pendulum, the longer the period of the pendulum. Our hypothesis, however, was incorrect as shown by the graph. Our hypothesis was that the relationship between length and period was linear, but as the graph displays, it is an exponential relation, denoted by $y=1.999 x^{0.5013}$

Our main research question was to develop a mathematical model for the relationship between a pendulum’s length and its period. Our mathematical model we developed was $y=1.999 x^{0.5013}$ while the actual relation is     $T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$       where T is the period, g is the gravitational constant of the earth,  and L is the length of the pendulum.

The independent variable we used to determine what affects the period of a pendulum was mass, as denoted by the graph. We found that mass does not affect the period, as the values on the chart are all within the same range of their error bars. 
The second independent variable we explored was the length of the pendulum. As researchers, we sought to see if the length of the pendulum would affect its period. As shown by the graph,there is a direct relation between the length of the pendulum and its period. The line of best fit shows that this is not a linear relationship, defeating the original hypothesis.

The third independent variable explored was the angle of the pendulum. As all times are within the error bars of the other values, it can be stated that the angles we measured do not affect the period of the pendulum.
As      $T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$         is the actual equation for the period of the pendulum, and our mathematical model we developed was    $y=1.999 x^{0.5013}$            , the similarities are clear.  is related to x0.5013 and 2π is related to 1.999. Our mathematical model supports the theoretical model as the relation between both equations place x at the 0.5 power.
Systematic error includes the range of uncertainty of the photogate, which is under 0.0001 seconds. With this level of uncertainty the results of the experiment should be minimally affected, with no recourse other than to purchase a more accurate photogate in the future.
Random errors in our experiment include the movement of air in the room, elasticity of the string, friction between the pendulum and the air, and the rotation of the earth. None of these random errors can be reduced, except for the movement of air so no action can be taken other than turning the air conditioner off.
Constraints the main constraint that affected the experiment was that of time. In this experiment we did not take enough measurements to bring results that would pass scrutiny. As a result, in future experiments more time should be taken to take more trials of the period, giving a more generalizable result.
