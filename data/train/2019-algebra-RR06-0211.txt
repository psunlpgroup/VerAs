conclusion:
The purposes of these labs were to determine how the acceleration of a system is impacted when the applied force changes. For lab 05, we were to develop two mathematical models to explain this. For lab 06, we were to explore these models and see how factors, like friction, impact the models.
	For the first experiment in lab 05, hanging mass vs. acceleration, our mathematical model was is  $A=0.026 M + 0.0236$ where A is acceleration and M is the force of the air pushing on the cart. This can also be seen on graph 1. This equation as well, as our R^2 value, was produced via our graph on excel. For the second experiment in lab 05, total mass vs. acceleration, our mathematical model was is  $A= 10.135 m^{-2.05}$, where A is acceleration and M is distance traveled by the cart. This can also be seen on graph 2. This equation, as well as our R^2 value, was also produced via our graph on excel.
	A random error for this lab includes the recording of acceleration from DataStudio. At first, it was not working properly and not recording anything. However, we got it to work but we were too sure how accurate the data was. In the future, a better version of DataStudio should be used. A possible systemic error for this lab includes the release of the system at the start of each trial. The same person released it each time, however, we were hopeful no extra force from them caused the cart to go faster. If there was more force, this was the cause the acceleration to be faster. We did our best to make sure no extra force was added 
	Constraints for this lab include the length of tracked we experimented on. It didn’t work properly for our first experiment in lab 05. We are unsure why but we did fix it. Also, if the track was a bit longer, it would provide more data and therefore, probably more accurate data.
	To achieve the consistency with Newton’s Second Law ($F=m a$), ours was formatted as is  $A=0.026 + 0.0236$ and $A=10.135^{-2.05}$. The differences between our mathematical models and N2L is that in his law, outside forces, most importantly in this case is friction, were ignored. Friction was taken into account for our data with our mathematical models.
