conclusion/discussion:

the objective of this experiment was to determine the relationship between the acceleration of an object and its force.  this was done by changing one specific variable while keeping all others constant. from the series of experiments, it could be concluded that as acceleration increases so does force. in addition, as mass increases acceleration decreases. this is supported in the first lab where our force / acceleration graph had a positive slope and our mass/ acceleration graph had a negative slope. for the second set of experiments it was concluded that friction had no effect on acceleration. this was concluded because all three of our friction graphs looked practically the same. the largest source of error for these experiments comes from the weight of each individual mass. each mass that was used in the experiment was weighed by hand. this created systematic error.
