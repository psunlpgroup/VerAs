what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? changing the length from which the pendulum swung, the mass swinging on the pendulum or the angle at which the pendulum is let go from are possible factors that could change the period. shown in table 1 three lengths were tested but a tread can be seen from such few data points. in figure 1 there is a positive linear relationship between length and period. the error bars do not overlap meaning the tread shown is not to errors. shown in figure 2 there seems to be a possible linear relationship between mass and period, however the errors bars overlap meaning this tread is due to errors or there are not enough data points to see the real tread. shown in figure 3 there also seems to be a relationship but a negative linear relationship. but again, the errors bars overlap and this trend cannot be accepted. the theoretical mathematical model is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. shown in figure 5 the equation of the best fit line is $y=0.1946 x^{0.5071}$ this is very close to the mathematical model and fits the trend of the line almost perfect. the errors bars in figures 2 and 3 overlapping makes sense, since they have no effect on the period because theyâ€™re not in the model to find the period. on error encountered when testing for length, was measuring the length of the pendulum. the total length is from the top of the string where it hangs all the way to the bottom of the mass; initially we were measuring only from the top of the string to the end of the string. to compensate for this error the length of the mass was measured and added to all the lengths tested. when this error was fixed the points on the graph seen in figure 5 line up much better to the best fit line then if the length of the mass was not accounted for. one constraint of this experiment is initially when mass and angle were being tested there were only 3 values tested for each. taking such few measurements and plotting fewer points did not show the full relationship between the factor and the period. in order to make to say conclusively mass and angle do not affect period they should be tested again with a larger range of values.
