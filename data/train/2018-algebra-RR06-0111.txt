The purpose for these experiments were to discover how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. The mathematical model derived from the week 5 results was $y=0.005 x - 0.0338$ where x represents the force in the theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, and (.005) represents 1/mass(system). The y intercept represents the negative forces at play, such as friction and air resistance, which subtract from the theoretical model. This model is demonstrated in figure 2.2, displaying the linear fashion of the data. This answers the research question by demonstrating that as the force applied by the hanging weight increases, the acceleration will also increase proportionally.
