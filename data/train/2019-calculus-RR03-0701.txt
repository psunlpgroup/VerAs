conclusion:
in conclusion, the goal of this experiment was to determine which variable affected the period of the pendulum. the three experiments tested whether each variable affected the period of the pendulum. the claim was that the length of string would most effect the period of the pendulum this was backed by the data collect as the range of uncertainty for the graph was very small. on the angle of release and mass graphs the range of uncertainty was so high itâ€™s likely the period was even affected. this information is backed up by the theoretical model. the error in this experiment were random error largely created by the data collection relying on human reaction times. constraints are time and the lack of many tools to make really accurate measurements.
