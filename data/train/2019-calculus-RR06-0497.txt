discussion and conclusion:

	for lab 5, we investigated how the acceleration of a system changes when the mass changes and for lab 6, we investigated how the inclination and the applied force affect the acceleration of the system within the same setup as that of lab 5. we have come to the conclusion that the force applied on the system at the point m2 is directly proportional to the acceleration of the system considering the variables mentioned above are left constant. the r^2 value of 0.9997 shown above for experiment 1 suggests a strong positive correlation between the mass and the acceleration. furthermore, newton’s second law states that $f=m a$ or force is directly proportional to the acceleration if the mass of the system remains constant. the photogate is known to have an uncertainty level of 0.0025 and there were other sources of error such as the friction between the string and the pulley system. some improvements include getting the pulley to be lubricated to reduce friction, getting better measurement equipment and getting all bobs positioned in the same location on the pulley. furthermore, comparing our formulas to our peers we have found them to be very close to one another within reasonable parameters. from lab 6, we came to the conclusion that the force applied in the system with positive inclination of the ramp decreases the acceleration of the cart whereas a positive inclination results in an increase in the acceleration of the cart. this is once again supported by out peer’s data which was also linear and with a similar slope. this led us to being very confident with our data acquired and used them to have a valid conclusion. this was also consistent with newton’s 2nd law of motion $f=m a$ and thus satisfied our conclusion.
