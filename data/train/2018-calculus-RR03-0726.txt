discussion and conclusion:

the impacts of the period of a pendulum for small swings. in lab 01 we tested the angle of release, mass, and length of the string using imprecise timing equipment. our data has many random errors because we used a stopwatch to measure the period of the pendulum. in the lab, 02 we observed the standard deviation and uncertainty of our past data using a stopwatch. finally, in lab 03, we can conclude that with more accurate measurements, we can find that a pendulum swings with a fitted trend of a power curve equation due to the photogate. the theoretical model for a period of a pendulum is 2(pi)(l/g)^1/2. we know that our answers are very accurate to the power curve fitting because the r^2 value (from the graph above) is 0.9996 or we are 99.96% accurate. the factors that didnâ€™t play a role compared to the theoretical model are the gravitational acceleration. there are some errors present in our data. there was a random error with the angle of release because that was done by hand. there is potentially a systematic error with the mass or the string measurements. a constraint in this experiment is time for some trials.
