discussed above.

our two experiment mathematical models are consistent with newtonâ€™s second law because as we increased mass the acceleration also increased. the same is for the force applied were you would have $\frac{f}{m} = a$. if you did 1/(given mass), you would end up getting our mass number in our second mathematical model being, .0023kg.
