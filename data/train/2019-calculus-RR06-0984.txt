conclusion:
The factors that impact the acceleration of a system are the hanging mass, glider mass, and gravitational force. As hanging mass and gravitational forces increase, acceleration increases. As glider mass increases, acceleration decreases. These trends are supported by the slopes of the graphs. An uncertainty value of .001 makes the error bars too small to see in all the above graphs. We found the equation for the first test to be 3.0758x - .0006 and the equation for the second test to be 1.0568 * e^(-0.304 * x). We are confident in our models because our first test had an R^2 of 0.9992 and our second test had a value of 0.9895. Though other groups had slightly different constant values, everyone else also had a linear function for the first equation and an exponential function for the second.

As a larger number of magnets, and thus greater magnetic force, was introduced, the acceleration of the system decreased, In agreement with our hypothesis. With respect to the two constants in the equation, we found that as more magnets were added the absolute value of C1 decreases and the absolute value of C2 increases. We are very confident in these finding, since the R^2 values are greater than .99 for all three graphs. The work done by another group who completed the same experiment reinforces our conclusion that increased magnetic force reduces the acceleration of a system. 
	C1 represents acceleration and C2 represents friction in the following theoretical equation is  $a = C1 w + C2$. The experimentally determined equation matches up with this theoretical equation, where y is a and x is w. The theoretical equation theoretical equation           $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ is also supported by the results of this experiment.
	Possible sources of systematic error in these experiments include the accuracy of the manual balance and the assumption that every single bob was the exact same weight. Possible sources of random error in these experiments include not releasing the glider from the same position every trial and potentially stopping the glider prematurely. Factors that were not considered include air resistance, air temperature and pressure, and change in acceleration due to gravity based on altitude above sea level.
	The results of the experiments do have some constraints that affect the generalizability of the results. One constraint is that the magnets used in this experiment are of unknown strength, and the resulting equations would be affected by magnets of different strength. Another constraint is the length of string between the hanging mass and the glider.
