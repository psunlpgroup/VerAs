conclusion:
When performing the experiment of all three labs, the research question was the main goal and it wanted to know what impacts the period of a pendulum. With all the data taken, it is easy to understand that the length of the string is what affects how long a period takes to complete. When the mass was an independent variable, there was no correlation between mass and the time the period takes to complete. As seen on this graph, the error bars show very little uncertainty and that the numbers recorded are accurate and precise. When the length of the string was the independent variable, there was a positive correlation between the length of string and its affect on the time/period. On the graph, the error bars show that this data is very accurate and precise and answers the research question restated above. The last independent variable tested was the angle of release. When analyzing this data from the graph, the angle of release doesn’t relate to time/period. The error bars shown on the graph appear to be large, but, they are very small. The mathematical model supports the theoretical model as it is very accurate, the graph follows the trendline of the power curve almost exactly. When performing this lab, there is a possibility of error, to reduce error, the group made sure to not put any force on the weight, also made sure to measure out the angle precisely every trial, and finally the group would measure the length of the string precisely. There are constraints with this lab, the first being time, although there was plenty of time to complete the lab it is still a constraint. Another constraint could be that there wasn’t enough technology involved to completely reduce human error.
