conclusion:
 in this experiment we were trying to find out what variables effect the period of the pendulum. the 3 variables that could effect the pendulum are length of string, mass and angle of elevation. through our experiments we were able to prove that the only variable that effects the period of the pendulum is the length of string. we claimed that the angle and mass would not effect the pendulum but the length of string would. we claim this because we know the mathematical representation of a pendulum is the equation would look like 2pi times the square root of (length divided by gravity) equals the period of the pendulum.  because the length of string is the only variable in the equation that can be changed, that means that it is the only variable that can change the duration of the period. the graphs also indicate what variable effects the period of the pendulum. as you can see as we changed the angle and mass of the pendulum the period remained the same. but you can see as we increased the length of the string the period also increased in duration. the initial test yielded some systematic error due to using a hand held timer. later this error was removed because we used a photogate system that would automatically time the period. this resulted in more reliable data. in the future to reduce more error would be to create a system that held the string taught and at the same angle for every drop. we were constrained by only being able to use a narrow range of variables. this may have caused our results to be generalized.
