the purpose of this experiment was to identify how acceleration of an object is affected by the applied force on that object. this was accomplished by developing an experimental model, as well as deriving/understanding the theoretical model. experimentation involved utilizing a cart (that has little to no friction) and a hanging mass attached to the cart. the string attaching the two passed over a rotary motion detector creating a pulley system. the system mass was kept constant. applied force was changed by taking mass off of the cart and adding it to the hanging mass (taking fishing bobbers of the cart and adding them to the hanging mass). changing the hanging mass (iv) affected the acceleration of the cart (dv), which allowed for the exploration of the research question. after compiling data where the applied force on the system was changed, the graph depicting acceleration vs. applied force in figure 1 was created. as it can be seen in the graph, the error bars for this set of data was very low with most being below 0.004 and only one point had an error bar of 0.012. the relationship between acceleration and applied force was found to be direct positive. the experimental model calculated from this graph was $y=0.0042 x - 0.0221$ where y is the acceleration and x is the applied force. the r^2 value was .9992, indicating that the linear fit line is the most accurate to use. this model was compared to models that other lab groups came up with. the group named team squirt had $y=4.346 x - 0.169$ as their model, and the group named monkeys had $y=0.0043 x - 0.055$ as their model. the model
