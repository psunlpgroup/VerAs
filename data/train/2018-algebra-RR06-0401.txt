	the purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of the mass of an applied force on the acceleration of a system. after experiments were performed, it was able to be determined that when the mass of an applied force on a system increases, the acceleration also increases.  this was tested by increasing the hanging mass on a string attached to a cart on a vacuum track.  no weight was removed or added to the system it was simply only taken from the cart and added to the hanging mass.  acceleration was calculated by the classroom software.  from table 2 and figure 1, it is shown that as the mass of applied force (hanging mass) increases, the acceleration increases as well.  figure 1 has error bars too small to be seen because of the software accuracy and based off the equivalency criterion, no bars are overlapping showing a clear relationship between mass of applied force and acceleration. from the theoretical equation, $a=\frac{m_{hanging}+f_{frictiob}}{m_{system}}$, the calculated acceleration at chosen 49g is 0.26m/s2 considering no external forces.  compared to the experimental equation, $y=c1 x+c2$, the calculated acceleration was again 0.26m/s2 showing our experiment performed was accurate and matches the theoretical equation when external forces are not considered.  the experimental equation given from figure 1 considering external forces was $y=0.0054 x-0.0313$ and when converted to kg it equals $y=5.4 x-0.0313$.  from the theoretical equation, c1 is 1/ system mass, our calculated c1 was 5.4 which matches our experimental equation.  to calculate the external forces acting on the system the equation is c2/c1 which gave us -0.0058n.  comparing our findings to other groups, one groups experimental equation is $y=4.9362 x-0.0102$, their theoretical c1 value is 5.3, and there calculated external force was -0.00206n (mann madison, vrbanic megan, hanson eva).  this groups external forces were slightly lower than ours which could have been due to our experimental c1 values being slightly different. the groups external forces however were acting in the same direction as ours shown from the negative sign.  overall, this groups equation agrees with our final conclusion that increasing the mass of applied force increases the acceleration of a system.  another groups data found showed their experimental equation was $y=4.8456 x-0.019$, theoretical c1 is 5.27, and their external forces were -0.0039n (lachovin nick, fields jack, kahn michael, zhang angela).  this again shows the external forces acting in the same direction.  their external forces were also slightly lower than ours.  this groups equation agrees with ours showing again an increase in mass of applied force increases a systems acceleration.  in a scenario where a heavy string were to connect the hanging weight with the cart, the acceleration would be predicted to decrease.  this is because the mass of the system is increasing and given the theoretical equation, if you increase the system mass, c1 will decrease which will give you a smaller acceleration.  some random error in this experiment could be due to measurement errors using the class software.  this could be improved by taking multiple data points at each applied force mass and averaging them.  systematic error could have involved weighing errors which could be improved with better equipment and more precision.  some constraints involved the amount of time given to perform experiments, data collected was only generalized and multiple trials werenâ€™t able to be performed.  another constraint is only being able to use small weights and a short track
