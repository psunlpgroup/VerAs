conclusion:
In conclusion, it can be seen that the length of the string is proportional to the period of the pendulum. While the mass and angle of release have no effect on the period of a pendulum. Since the error bars overlap in the graphs for mass and angle it is assumed that the value did not change, as such there is no correlation between period and angle or mass. When looking at the graph for length a line of best fit has the equation of a power line. Perio$d=2.017 l^{0.5019}$. When compared to the theoretical model – 2pi (length/acceleration due to gravity)^0.5 – the experimental equation is close to this value. Since 2pi/(g)^0.5 is approximately 2. This show that the data collected is fairly accurate. This is support by an R2 value of 0.9999. According to the mathematical model from the derived equation the period of the pendulum should 1.425s when the length is 0.5 meters, but the graph has it as 1.413s. That’s a difference of 0.012s this show that the data is fairly accurate.
While conducting this experiment there was systematic and random error that caused the experimental equation from the theoretical equation. An analog scale was used instead of a digital on so the calibration of the scale is much trickier and could have lead to incorrect values. There was also human error that affected the experiment. People using timers to measure the period do not have perfect reaction time, which leads to slight alteration of the data. To avoid this next time a sensor should be used to measure period as to remover the human element. Further more the experiment was not conducted in a vacuum so air resistance should have also skewed the data. Next time all digital measuring devices should be used and the experiment should be conducted in a vacuum as to avoid air resistance affecting the period.
 Mathematical Period is  1.425 s; Our Value is  1.413 s. The value off of our graph is less than .02s less than the mathematical value.
