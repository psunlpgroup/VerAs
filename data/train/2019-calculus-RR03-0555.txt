conclusion:
 to restate the question: will the period of the pendulum be affected by the length of the string.



 we were able to find that the mass of the pendulum and the angle of release would not affect the     

     period of time as the graphs above shows little to no change when they are dv. as for the length of 

     the string, we can see an increase of time as the string also increases. we also made sure that all 

     values being tested would be constant and not have different inputs. 



  the theoretical mathematical model for the period of the pendulum is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$. this fits our 

     data because when we test the graph for the length of the string, we get an equation of 

     0.2924x^0.4202 as we can convert the first equation further to see that our equation is similar to

     $t=2.006 l^{0.5}$. our equation also works for increasing values as when length increases, the value of 

     time will also increase from the equation. we can also see why the mass and angle of release do not 

     affect the period of the pendulum as the equation $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ does not include these variables 

     in it as only the length of the string and even gravity only affect the period of the pendulum.

 some systematic error that we could have experienced would be if the measuring tape that we used 

     could have been worn form use and thus could cause our length measurements to be off. another 

     systematic error could be the timers that we used to measure the period of the pendulum. this error 

     would be if the timers were slower than what they used to be from years of use and thus create an 

     underestimate of time. these errors could be overcome if we would input our area of uncertainty to 

     even out our results. another method could be to use an automatic timer, precise measurer, or even 

     new rulers and timers. as for random errors, some error could be that we did not measure the length 

     of the string correctly and that we were either too late to start the timer on time or too late to stop 

     the timer. these errors would affect our data greatly as even a minimum error region answer could 

     be far off from the actual answer. to account for this, we can also do what we did for the systematic 

     errors, get automatic timers and measurers so that we can get more precise data.

 some constraints in our experiment could be that we did not have the top of the art measuring tools 

     and this could cause some of our results to be different if we did have better equipment. another 

     constraint would be air resistance. if we were to suck out all of the air from a room and just have the

     gravity acting on the pendulum, we could see that the pendulum would not be slowed down by the 

     air and thus could get results that could be the true values of the pendulum. a final constraint could

     be that the human body cannot control reaction time to the exact time needed and thus the timers

     would be off in terms of stopping after one pendulum swing. this would cause our times to be either 

     overestimated or underestimated and thus affect our results.
