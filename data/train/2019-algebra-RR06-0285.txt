discussion and conclusion

	the research purpose/question for this lab report was to see how force effects acceleration and how opposing forces effect acceleration. the hanging weight acted as the force applied to pull the cart forward, we changed it by moving fishing bobber from the hanging weight to the cart and vice versa. this addressed the research question by seeing how different forces had different acceleration values and we kept the systems weight the same. higher forces have higher accelerations, and this was proven by our data above. there was some systematic error due to misreading’s in data studio. our readings supported our predictions by showing that higher forces result in higher accelerations and if you have an opposing force such as friction in our case, the acceleration is lowered. random errors in this experiment include is  timing errors, misreading’s in data studio, possible errors in the weight calculations, and just random human and systematic error. the constraints we were limited by in this lab were is  not having another accurate way of measuring the acceleration other than data studio and having uneven masses (fishing bobbers were not the same mass as each other). this effects the results by having slight differences in the force that we didn’t account for causing slight miscalculation.
