conclusion:
Newton’s Laws experiments are meant to show a demonstration of creating and apply a mathematical model of motion and how it compares to the real-life events set up for the lab. In the first part of the experiment, creating a model to see how force can affect the acceleration of an object essential in the creation of a model crated by students. To test this first question, there was a hanging mass attached to the cart that would show this relationship, see setup below. For our first system, we used a cart that had fishing bobbles hooked on to the sides, seven to start with, and one hanging to test how the force from the hanging mass affected the cart’s acceleration. The second system was like the first, with the exception that the cart was larger and red; but still had the same weighted bobbles and amount attached. The variables that we used were, the independent variable would be the force since that is what we are planning to affect out dependent variable. The dependent variable was the acceleration of the system since we can manipulate that by changing the weight of the cart and distributing it to the hanging mass. The control variable our group chose was the total mass of the system that came to be 186.4 g. this included that cart’s individual weight which was 147.5 g and the eight bobbles that weighted about 5. 8g.  
The methods that were used during the first part of the experiment were to calculate the total system weight which included the eight bobbles in total that were going to be used. The system weight measurements for the different trials were manipulated since it was our control variable. For every trial run, one bobble was taken off from the cart and transferred to the hanging mass that started with one bobble. Then setting up the force vs acceleration table followed collecting the data points. By creating this data table, we can easily compare our results to the theoretical calculations and find that our experiment was in fact very close to the expected theoretical values. For the second part of the experiment, the method of the setup was like the first in the regard to the system having seven bobbles on the cart and one bobble hanging. We continued to use the data table from the first part of the experiment for review. 
The results for the first part of the lab concluded that when we calculated the acceleration of the cart and the force applied to the cart, we came up with an equation of $y=4.4864 x + 0.0234$. this was solved by using the theoretical model of finding acceleration $a=\frac{f_g}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_f}{m_{sys}}$. By using this model, we came to find that our acceleration and our x are equal to the force on the cart. For the second part of the experiment, still using the equation of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ and with a given acceleration of .45m/s2 to achieve, the group needed to solve the calculation of how much weight needed to hang to for the cart to achieve the given acceleration. Below is the figure depicting the math used to solve for the hanging mass. The mass calculated needed to be 15. 6g which equals to approximately 3 bobbles to hang. After testing the cart to see if it reached the given acceleration of .459 m/s2 with an uncertainty of .0054. 
 
	Some errors that were encountered during both parts of the lab were the inaccurate measure of weight using the triple beam balance and errors using the air track with the cart moving down during the trials in the first part of the experiments. For the second part of the experiment, would be that since there is no way to get a precise measurement for the bobbles hanging at the end of the string from our calculated value it could have affected us getting a more accurate acceleration reading.
