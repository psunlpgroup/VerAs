conclusion

while the weight and the angle do change how force and acceleration interact with the pendulum, the resulting time is unchanged. by increasing or decreasing the length of string however we see the period of the pendulum increase or decrease respectively. the period of a pendulum is           $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$            where l is length of the pendulum and g is the force of gravity on the pendulum. since l/g is a fraction we know that by increasing the numerator, or l in this case, we should also increase the overall output of the equation. in other words, we can see from the equation that length is a positive correlator in this equation. we did experience some systematic error throughout this lab, particularly when it came to measure the angle and we did see a small correlation, but we ruled out causation with a t test. these are however constrained results, a pendulum outdoors may experience more external forces that those in our lab, and i would not say i could calibrate a clock to my pendulum just yet, but in general, particularly in ideal conditions such as this lab was performed in, we can see what affects the period of a pendulum, and it is length.
