discussion and conclusion

	a. the purpose of this lab was to develop mathematical models to represent newton’s second law for a system and to develop an understanding as what each value in the model represented. the first model represented the effect of varying the mass of the system on acceleration and the second represented the effect of varying force on acceleration. in the first lab period, these two models were determined through experimentation. the goal of the second lab period was to understand the meaning of each variable included in the models. to help determine this, the same experiment varying the force applied on the cart performed the previous lab session was again replicated multiple times under different frictional values to show the role friction may play in the equation. 



	b. the first experiment led to its mathematical model of $a = 7054 * m^{0.9992}$ by varying the value of mass in the equation $f =m a$. we believe the x value in this equation was the value of the cart. this is because as x increases, acceleration decreases which is consistent with $a =\frac{f}{m}$ . the produced graph for this data had the form of an exponential function with an exponent less than 1. this suggests that the independent variable (mass of cart) and the dependent variable have an inverse relationship which is again consistent. our error bars are small enough as well to conclude that error did not play an effect in our calculations. 

	

	the second experiment led to its mathematical model of $a = 1.09 m  + 1.273$ by varying the value of force in the equation $f =m a$. we believe the x value in this equation represents the mass of m2 which is equivalent to the force on the cart m1. this can be concluded because as m2 is increased in the graph of the data, acceleration also increased with a linear relationship consistent with increasing f in the equation $f =m a$. error bars in the graph are also small enough to be ignored. the 1.273 constant value in the equation we believe is the force of friction or other non-conservative forces acting upon the system.  



	the third experiment led to its mathematical models of  $a = 75.678 x – 2.687$, $a = 78.43 x – 0.438$, and $a = 75.58 x + 0.361$. this also was obtained by varying f in the equation $f =m a$, but was done for three different frictional values. the net force on the mass of m1 is therefore force of tension minus force of friction. again, we believe that the x value represents the mass of the cart since that causes the linear relationship with acceleration when varied. the constant c2 value we believe represents friction in the system as this varied when the friction of the system was changed. for this experiment error bars were not generated as they were shown to be small enough to be ignored in the previous lab period. since the value of equation is equal to fnet/mass (not just the force of the weight of m2) the value of force in this equation is being manipulated. 


this group’s results suggest the force of friction causes the acceleration of the system to be lower. this is consistent with knowledge from outside lab as friction always opposes an object’s motion and will cause the net force to be smaller than it would be with no frictional force. the findings of this group suggest that friction is represented by c2 in the equation. as friction is increased, the c2 value will be lower resulting in a lower acceleration. while this data is not consistent with the results obtained by our group, they are much more consistent with the model $f = m a$. this is because a lower value of net force will cause a lower value of acceleration if mass is constant. 



this group’s data suggest that as the angle of the track is increased upwards, the acceleration of the cart will decrease. this is consistent with knowledge from outside lab as if the cart moves upward it will experience a downward force of mass*9.8*sin() (where  is the angle between the track and the horizontal axis). the data suggests that the c1 value in the equation may also be related to the angle of release as it varies between their equations significantly. this is consistent with the equation of $f =m a$ as the net force will depend on the angle of the ramp. if the ramp has a positive slope, the mass of the cart will have a vertical component that will oppose the force exerted by the hanging weight.

there are several random/systematic errors that may have played an effect on our obtained results. firstly, there may have been a slight slant of the track unaccounted for which would have systematically caused out results to be higher or smaller than ideally. air resistance could have also played a role and lowered the values obtained for acceleration since this would be a force against the motion of the object. another error is the positioning of the magnets on the cart as they often shifted around in position and affected the distribution of weight for the cart which could affect the acceleration of the system potentially. if the mass of the string also played a factor in the net force and was not negligible, the acceleration of the cart would be greater as the string hanging vertically of the end of the track would add additional force on the cart. since $a = \frac{f_{net}}{m_{sys}}$ , acceleration would increase. 

	a number of steps were taken throughout the experiments to minimize the above errors. to keep the setup of the cart most consistent, the same person set up the cart system for every trial. unfortunately, nothing could be done to minimize air resistance or ensure the track was completely level. to try to keep the magnets in the same positions, tape was used to best secure them to the cart. 

	in the future, the track could be measured to ensure the angle is completely level. the experiment could also be conducted under conditions where there is minimal to no air resistance. more trials may also be taken to obtain more accurate results. 

	 
 there a a few constraints present in this experiment that could limit the generalizability of the obtained results. to start, the track was only a few feet long so the acceleration over a longer distance could not be tested. for larger distances accelerations may have been lessened due to an increasing force of friction or air resistance with the higher velocity. additionally, the cart weighed 300g to begin with so the results can not be generalized for data with a mass less than 300g. with a smaller mass, the acceleration would have been lower due to $f =m a$ and also because the frictional force would likely also be lessened. the force was limited as well because we only had bobs that totaled in weight of 45 grams. this means the relationship as force was farther increased could not be tested to test acceleration. as force continues to increase it would have been expected for acceleration to continually increase as well. 

the theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system is $f=m a$. our first mathematical model when the mass of the cart was varied is is  $a = 7054 m^{0.9992}$ . this is consistent with $f = m a$ when mass is increased in this equation acceleration will be lower since it is raised to a power that is less than one. therefore, mass in the calculated equation has an inverse relationship with acceleration which is consistent with the ideal mathematical model.

	our second mathematical model for varying the force on the cart is  is  $a = 1.09 m + 1.273$ . this is consistent with newton’s model because the mass of m2 times 9.8 is equal to the force on the cart. therefore, this equation represents a positive correlation between force and acceleration which is consistent with $f = m a$.
