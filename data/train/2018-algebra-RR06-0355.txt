discussion and conclusion:

the question that was being researched was “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?”. when analyzing the acceleration vs. applied force graph, it does support the hypothesis positively. it can be seen in graph 1 that the r² value obtained was 0.99239, which is close to 1, which indicates a very big correlation between the two variables. this makes sense because mass and acceleration are multiplied together to equal the force, so if one gets bigger, the other gets bigger as well. this also has to do with gravity pulling down on the mass towards the earth, making the acceleration also faster than if it were to be pulled horizontally. the correlation can also be found in figure 3 (“group 3”) and in figure 4 (“group 5”) as being a positive linear correlation. some of the errors that could have contributed to the overall system could have been systematic error (“group 4”). specific examples could have been not taking the correct weight of a bobber(s) or the cart, rounding too much when calculating, using a worn out instrument, etc. other errors could have had an impact on the system, but had either little to no effect when running the experiment and therefore were not accounted for.
