conclusion:
in both labs conducted we used a frictionless surface, a cart, and bobbers as well as weights.

for lab 5 iv and dv’s differed slightly from lab 6 with the introduction of inclination as an independent variable.

in both labs me and my group decided to control the mass of the cart as a set-controlled variable

we made hypothesis’ for both labs, for 5 it was a hypothesis that the hanging mass would greatly affect the acceleration as well as the cart mass but less than the hanging mass.

then, we predicted that the hanging mass would affect the acceleration as well as the cart mass
