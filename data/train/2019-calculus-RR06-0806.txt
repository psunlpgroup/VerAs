discussion & conclusion

the objectives of labs 05 and 06 were to design and conduct controlled experiments to determine mathematical models from experimental data and how aspects of the physical lab setting contribute to mathematical models. to determine the mathematical models three experiments were conducted. in our first experiment, how the applied force impacts the acceleration of the system was compared. a different forces were applied to the system and the acceleration was calculated (see graph 01 & table 01). the mathematical model determined from the graph of the data was $a = 2.09 f + 0.169$ where 2.09 represents the mass and .169 is the coefficient of friction. the second experiment how the mass of the system impacts the acceleration was investigated. different hanging masses were chosen and their resultant accelerations were calculated. the mathematical model for this experiment found from the graph of the data (see graph 02) was $a = 0.216 e^{0.0437} m$ the third experiment conducted was to determine how the angle of incline or decline effects the acceleration of the system. small platforms were placed under the rear end of the air track changing the angle of the incline and the acceleration of the system was calculated using a constant applied force. the same steps were performed for placing the platforms under the front end of the air track. the mathematical models for this experiment found from the graphs of the data (see graph 03) changed depending on the angle of the incline. as the angle increased from .1813 to .2736 and -.1813 to -.2736 the mathematical model changed also, from $a = 3.06 f + 0.0399$ to $a = 2.88 f + 0.0272$. in these models the c1 constant represents the mass and the c2 represents the coefficient of friction. another groups data is shown below (see group 01 data). shown in their data, as the height of the incline, or the angle, increased the c1 and c2 changed. based off their data it confirms that our results were correct, giving more data to support our claim that the angle of the incline impacts the acceleration of the system. when performing the experiments some error could have been present. when weighing the mass of the system the scale could have not been calibrated properly resulting in scale error. in order to reduce this error a precise analytical balance could be implemented to provide a precise and accurate value for the mass. our mathematical models show to be consistent with newtown’s second law, $f = m a$. our first model $a = 2.09 f + 0.169$ shows that force and acceleration are correlated as stated in newtown’s second law.
