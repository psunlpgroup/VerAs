discussion and conclusion

what impacts the period of a pendulum?

application to research question

we originally predicted that the length would not affect the pendulum.

this claim was false because the graph for the length vs. time was the only graph that showed time changing.
we originally predicted that the weight would change the time which is false.

when looking at the graph for weight vs. time there is no change in time with the differing weights.
we originally predicted that the angle would not change the time which is true.

when looking at the graph there is no indication of a change in time.

this was the only factor that changed the time of the period. the power function is seeing the graph and the data that was found resembles this equation since the r^2 value was 0.9998
the change in weight did not affect the time. this can be seen in the graphs since the line is straight and has a slope that is almost horizontal.


the change in angle did not affect the time. this can be seen in the graphs since the line is straight and has a slope that is almost horizontal.

there can be a machine that automatically starts and stops the pendulum.

the weight can be weighed on a scale and the string can be precut to specific lengths.

the testing can be done in an isolated room with as little outside influence as possible. 

the stopwatch not stopping exactly on the press of the button

using a sensor that can instantaneously detect the position of the pendulum and stop correctly.
the use of a tape measure can be improved with a sturdier ruler and more precise measuring increments. 

a sturdier hanger for the string would make sure that the string and pendulum are the only objects moving in the system.
