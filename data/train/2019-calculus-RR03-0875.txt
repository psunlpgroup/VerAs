discussion and conclusion



this investigation into what variables affect the period of a pendulum resulted in the conclusion that only length of the string had an effect when the release angle was lower. the period vs mass graph has a low r-squared value, indicating a low correlation. for this reason, it was not considered in the final equation we derived for period. the period vs release angle graph shows a strong correlation, but the values tested for angle were all relatively high. we were informed that the release angle has almost no effect on the period when the angle was below 25 degrees, so we did not take it into account during our final derivation of the formula. the one independent variable we did test for was string length, since its correlation was very high throughout the large range in which we took samples for it. because of this, we did our final tests by varying string length, keeping mass constant at 230g, and keeping the release angle under 20 degrees. by fitting this data to a power graph (pictured above on second page) we determined that the equation for period vs string length is about [ $t= 2  l^{0.411}$]. the power graph was chosen because its r-squared value indicated it fit the data better than any other graph available in excel. this model is very close to the accepted model of [ $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$]. 2pi * sqrt(1/g) is approximately 2, and sqrt(l) is very close to l^(.411). the remaining error in the equation is likely due to the string lengths being too short. the longer the string lengths we added to our data, the closer we got to the exponent of l being 0.5, but we ran out of space to increase the length. the random error of the person timing the stopwatch could be reduced by timing multiple periods at once and dividing that time by the total number of periods measured. this was not done by our group until the photogate was used. the results generated by this experiment are only applicable when the force pulling the pendulum down produces an acceleration of 9.8 m/s/s. a change in gravity would cause the coefficient of l to change in our equation, and a constant force (instead of gravity, which changes with mass) would cause the mass of the weight to affect the period. as a result, our equation can only be applied under this specific set of circumstances.
