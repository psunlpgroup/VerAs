conclusion:
 what factors impact the period of a pendulum?

 the experiments all addressed the research question by testing each factor individually while keeping all other possible factors constant/controlled. the claim originally made for the mass connected to the string factor was that the greater the mass the aster the period. after collecting the data, it is realized that this claim is false. as you can see from graph 1, the data points do not seem to follow a trend in any way, especially with how much the error bars overlap each other. the claim originally made for the angle of release factor was as the angle decreases so does the period. after collecting the data this appears to be false. the data seems to have no trend, especially with the overlap of the error bars. the claim for the length of string factor, was that as the length decreases so will the time of the period. this is seen in the graph as the length increases the data points seems to rise in seconds as well. there is a small overlap of the error bars for a few of the data points but overall there seems to be a trend very similar to the original claim made.

 the theoretical model of the pendulum is described by the following equation, $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, where g is gravity, l is length in meters, and t is time of the period in seconds. this is very similar to the trend that was experimentally calculated for the length of the string. when the length of string factor was reexamined with more trials, the model is  $t= 2.0465 l^{0.4191}$. this model is very close to the theoretical model.  the other factors that were tested do not seem to be a part of the theoretical model.

 some random errors that might have been in the experiments include wind resistance, and the human timing of the stopwatch. a possible systematic error might be that the masses not being the same mass as it says on them.

 some possible constraints that might have limited the results include the length of string can only be as long as the post that was holding it , the only masses that can be tested are the ones provided. these would generalize the results because it would limit the spread of the data thus making it harder to view the potential relationship.
