discussion of experiment 03

	this experiment was designed to answer the question, ‘does the amount of friction impact the acceleration of the cart?’. through the data analysis it was concluded that there is a positive linear relationship between friction and the acceleration of the cart. this was supported by the error bars, trendline, and mathematical equation that was calculated through the graph. the mathematical models had three r2 values that ranged from 0.9978, 0.9993 and 0.9997. the closer this value is to one, the closer the data is fitted to the trendline. the trendline also is used to support the claim that the graph is presenting a positive linear function. the error bars observe the uncertainty of the data points. since the error bars are so small it can be concluded that there is a small fraction of uncertainty in the collected values. these different applications present the evidence that supports the claim. 

	a comparison of data was conducted to find further evidence that supported the claim. the mathematical models were compared and evaluated to test the hypothesis. the mathematical model from figure 5 reads, $y=2.6868 x + 0.008$ and another group’s equation read $y=2.7858 x - 0.0155$. these equations came from the graph with zero friction being applied to the cart. the difference between the y-intercept may be from that the other group may have had different control values than ours. the second and third trials are very different from one another. the group’s reads $y=0.7622 x + 0.054$ while ours was $y=2.1042 x + 0.01$ for the second trial. the third trial equations were, $y=0.4672 x - 0.031$ was theirs and ours was $y=1.7444 x - 0.0145$. the reason for the large difference can be from the difference in the control variable and how much applied force was used. however, the trends are the same for each trial. the slope gets smaller each time weight is added, which supports our hypothesis further. 

	when looking at the effects of acceleration an equation can be used to indicate how acceleration will change when only one force is acting on the system. the equation reads $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, where f is the force applied and msystem is the mass of the system. when the force increases this leads to an increase in the acceleration of the system. relating this equation back to the linear function obtained from experiment 03 which was in the formula of $a=c1 w + c2$. this equation is using c1 as the applied force and c2 as the mass. the two equations state the same thing, as the applied force increases, the acceleration should increase as well.

	the enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ and is very useful when more than one force is acting on the system. the only force that was accounted for in this experiment was applied force, but gravitational force could also be applied. if gravitational force was considered than the value of gravitational force would be negative because it is opposing the force of friction. the gravitational force would then decrease the overall acceleration of the system.

	there was an error that arose during the run of this experiment. the error occurred was the scale that was being used. a new balance could help with the accuracy of the data, especially when measuring the applied force. 

	there were a few constraints that occurred during the experiment. these constraints are the amount of friction applied and the number of trials. the more data that is obtained the more accurate and precise the results could be. taking five more trial could have yielded a better mathematical model. the amount of friction could have been calculated better and been more. it was not possible to get a good measurement on the amount of friction that was being applied to the cart. with this knowledge it will be easier to repeat the experiment.
