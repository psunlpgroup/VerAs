conclusion:
 the purpose of this lab is to derive mathematical models from performed experiments, and to understand the values from the mathematical models and compare them to generalized formulas of physics.

  the first model derived was $y=0.0023 x - 0.0112$. for the experiment of force applied (g*m/s^2) vs. acceleration (m/s^2). the equation in terms of its parts are y is acceleration in m/s^2, .0023 is 1/mass in grams, x is the force, and -.0112 is an constant that corrects the model for friction or any other outside force that may have been acting on the cart during its run time.

 the second model is $y=\frac{0.1375}{x^{0.96}}$ for the experiment mass vs. acceleration, y is the acceleration in m/s^2, x is the mass of the cart in kg, .1375 is a constant multiplying the mass to reduce it by almost 14%, and -.969 in the power is the constant that reduces the value for what ever the inputted mass is (the higher the mass the lower the acceleration). 

the third model is $y=28.467 x+0.0063$ for 3 mm of tilt y is the acceleration of the cart in m/s^2, 28.457 is a constant for the mass of the cart in the system, x is the mass of the hanging block in kg, and .0063 is a constant that adjusts for the tilt of the track (-.0094  for 0 mm, .0063 for 3mm, .0194 for 6mm, .0364 for 9mm, and .0533 for 12 mm).
this is the data for group 6. their mathematical model is $y=0.0287 x-0.0715$ for 0 mm tilt. their model is almost identical to ours except out constant differs by a magnitude of nearly 1000. this is because their mass in the constant is in kg while ours is in grams (1 kg is 1000 g).
this is the data for group 3. their model is $a=2.8853 f_a-0.0132$. their iv is different than our group because they added height to the front of the track increasing the tilt, while our iv was the opposite. however, the model is still applicable to compare closely. since the acceleration is decreasing because the tilt goes up and in the front the constant goes down in their equation, and the constant in our equation goes up while tilt increases. 
there was little error in this experiment due to the implementation of the near frictionless track and the pulley that calculated acceleration for us. these factors led to almost no human error in the data collection. the r^2 values for the graphs and models we derived were 1 for the first experiment force applied vs. acceleration, .9998 for the second experiment mass of cart vs. acceleration, and all the error bars in the graph are not visible. however, there could have been some error in the data collection through positioning of the cart, or how it is held or released this would be random error.

some constraints that would limit the experiment are that the experiments are performed on a frictionless cart which when it is redone on a track that includes friction there will be a difference in the result. another constraint that could limit the model and experiment is that for the experiment incrementing the tilt of the track the height was added in a specific way on that certain track by putting weights under it. this could yield different by using different tilt methods.
 our mathematical models are consistent with newtons second law because they are all $a=\frac{f}{m}$ but because of different units and numbers well below zero it works the same way as $a=\frac{f}{m}$.
