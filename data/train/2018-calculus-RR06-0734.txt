conclusion:
When comparing the theoretical model, which is  and our experimental model, which is , we found that our model was very close to the actual theoretical model. The reason that it is not exact is due to experimental error. We noticed that even though there is the force of the hanging that is changing the acceleration, we started to think about the other forces that may be presented. The conclusion we came to was that there might be friction on the air track as well as friction from the pulley. In the experimental model, the mass of the hanging system shows up in the force because we are measuring the acceleration. Mass directly affects the force and by that affects the acceleration.
	Within the mass of the system, we counted the string as part of the system. The reason we did this is because without this measurement, the acceleration would not be uniform because the acceleration of the cart is dependent on the force of the hanging mass. The force caused by the hanging mass would increase as we and more weight onto the string and the force of gravity would increase the acceleration as the string goes through the pulley. 
	During the end of the experiment, we discussed the different errors that we may have had during the it. We came to the conclusion that there is systematic error with the scale and the calculated acceleration within the program used to find the acceleration of the cart. At first, we assumed that the calculated acceleration was the random error but after clarification, we understood that it was systematic error instead. To reduce these errors, we were thinking that the equipment should be checked first before conducting the lab. Towards the end, we didnâ€™t think we had any limitations when completing the experiment. It was a straight forward experiment with tons of data collecting to get an accurate representation of our hypothesis.
