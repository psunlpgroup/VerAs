conclusion:

the purpose of this lab was to determine what would happen to the acceleration of a system when the force applied to it changes. more specifically, if we change the hanging mass of the cart, how is the acceleration affected. for this experiment an air track was used along with a small cart with bobbers attached to it. first, the system was determined to be the cart, string, and all 8 bobbers which came out to a mass of 187.6 g with 0.05 g uncertainty. for the first trial, 1 bobber was hanging off the string and the other 7 were attached to the cart. the air track was turned on and the cart was let go. the graph and the acceleration, force, and uncertainty were obtained from datastudio and recorded. next, there were 2 bobbers attached to the string on the cart with 6 attached to the cart itself and again the cart was let go and the data was recorded. this was conducted 6 more times, for a total of 8 trials, each time adding one more bobber to the end of the string. 

looking at the data in table 1a, we can see that the relationship between force and acceleration is directly proportional. as the force increases, the acceleration increases as seen also in figure 1 as a linear relationship. as the number of bobbers hanging increased, the acceleration increased. we know from newton’s second law that $f = m a$ and that acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. . the acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object, less mass equals more acceleration. from the experiment, data, and graph we can conclude that as the applied force increases so does the acceleration of the system. 

the equation for $a =\frac{m g + f_{friction}}{m_{sys}}$.the mathematical model is $y=c1 x+c2$.  our experiment resulted in the equation is  $a = 0.0045 m g + 0.028$ or $y=4.5 x+28$. the constant in our experiment(c2) should be equal to 1/ mass of system, which is a value of 0.0053. our experimental value is a little lower which could be due to the uncertainty values of the air track and measuring scale. 

according to group 1’s findings in figure 2, their equation from their graph came out to be $y=0.0053 x^{-6} 10^{-6}$. their mass of .187kg and calculated c1 value of 5.34 kg is pretty close to our experimental values of .1876 and 5.33 respectively. their calculated c1 value was pretty spot on with their theoretical value which our theoretical value was much lower than the experimental value. their c2 value was 6x10^3 which is way smaller than ours at 0.028. group team platypus’s results were a mass system of 0.1888 kg with a theoretical equation of $y=5.0372 x-0.0374$. group 1 and group team platypus both had negative c2 values which is different than our equation which had a positive c2 theoretical value. there were some major differences in our numbers and these could have been because of systematic and random errors throughout the experiment. 

besides the gravitational force of the hanging mass, there could be some friction force and that would be seen in c2 of the equation. the mass of the system shows up in the c1 and c2 of the experimental model. c1 comes from 1/mass of the system. c2 comes from the f external/ mass of the system. if the string was non-massless, meaning it had a significant mass, and friction was negligible the cart will still maintain uniform acceleration. if the string had a mass, it would combine with the hanging mass and the acceleration would continue to increase as the hanging mass falls because the weight of the string will contribute to the pulling force. a systematic error that could have occurred could be an incorrect initial reading of the mass of the system. if the mass of the string was high enough to have an effect on the acceleration, there would still be uniform acceleration because the mass of the system would still be constant.

another systematic error is that we neglected friction from the air track in our equation. this results in the theoretical being larger than the experimental value. a random error could have been that when the air track was turned on, the cart wasn’t held for a few seconds before being let go. this could lead to slight differences in our data. one constraint in this experiment is that we only had 8 bobbers to use so the mass of the system was limited to only the weight of 8 bobbers and the cart and to get more reliable results that weight should be expanded.
