discussion and conclusion

	the research question that was being investigated in this lab is what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. with the 3 lab periods used to make up this lab report we discovered that the only factor that effects the period of the pendulum for small swings is the length of the string (m). the claims that support this conclusion is that the standard deviation of factor 1b and 1c is very close to zero and also the graph have little to no change.  the theoretical equation of a pendulum is  . the number of our theoretical gravity is 6.707 m/s^2 for our experiment. this equation that is given above l means length and t equals the period of the pendulum that means that the equation gives us a clear reason why the length is the only variable to affect the period of the pendulum. the errors that may of arose during these experiments are mostly random errors due to human error of not stopping the stopwatch exactly or not marking the correct number of swings and angle of drop. the systematic error may have come into play when in lab 3 the photogate came into play. the main constraint of this lab was the limit of the dropping angle of 30 degrees and the limit of the units of increase in weight. in conclusion, the only factor that can affect the period of the pendulum is the length of the string and as the length of the string increased the period increased as well. this relationship produced a power function and gave us an equation of $t=2.1009 l^{0.424}$ with an r^2 value of 0.9947.
