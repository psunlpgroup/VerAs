discussion and conclusion:



	the tests above were helped used to solve the research question that asked how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. this was solved throughout five trials, that increased the hanging force mass, but also kept the whole system’s mass at 0.1746kg. this was done by using keeping the same number of bobbers on the system, but changing how many were on the hanging weight. based on the graph above, it is clearly shown that the force increases as the acceleration increase, by using a linear fit it helps the mathematical relationship makes sense due to the equation $f=ma$. the error bars are too small to be seen, showing that none overlap, also concluding that as the force increases as the acceleration increase.

	group two’s data helps support the claim that as the weight of the hanging mass increases, the acceleration of the system also increases. this can be seen in the figure below. group two data points were very similar to my groups data points, allowing it to clearly be shown that our hypothesis’ are correct. group two’s mathematical model also agree’s with our groups, allowing the claim’s that acceleration increases as the hanging weight increases to be true. group six, also had similar finding’s, however they did not add their theoretical yield or mathematical model, so it was hard to determine how close their data actually was. their data points can also be shown below.

	the theoretical model gives us the equation that relates the acceleration to the net force and mass of the system, with $f=a m_{sys}$. using the theoretical model as well as the mass of the total system, we took the inverse of that value and obtained 5.727 kg, which compared with the value from our graph, y is 5.3792 kg is close enough to allow our mathematical model to be similar to our theoretical model. we obtained y is 5.3792 by using a linear fit on our graph. our enhanced theoretical equation was $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ was used due to the multiple forces that need to be considered. these other forces consist of the tension of the string, friction of the track, or our track not being completely level. the tension of the string can vary due to how many times it’s been used before, friction can be determined by the wear and tear of the track, or having the track not be completely level can cause unaccounted uncertainties in the experiment.

	the string had to be light as possible because if it wasn’t, it would add weight to the hanging mass causing a greater acceleration. some random error was the mass of the objects from the triple beam balance, as well as the force uncertainty from data studio or from the linear fit. each random error can be reduced by taking more data and averaging them together. a major constraint was needing a weightless string, as well as needing the tract to be completely level. being able to find an almost weightless string to help get correct data points, as well as being able to have a level tract are constraints because they are out of our hands and also very hard to get them perfect.
