conclusion:
	to restate, the point of the experiments was to test how different variables affected the period of a pendulum. in the first experiment we tested how change of mass affected the period while keeping the angle and the length of string the same. we realized that even though the mass of the pendulum was increasing, the period was consistent. we then tested changing the string length. as the length increased, the time grew as well. finally, in experiment one we tested a change in angle.  as the angle got bigger, the time decreases. again, in experiment two we tested all three and it showed that mass has no effect, an increase in length increases time, and increasing the angle decreases the period. then in the third experiment our results were reinforced because a photogate was used for higher accuracy. the formula for the period of a pendulum is $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ where l is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration of gravity. based on the length’s relationship in the formula, as the length increases, the period will increase with it. to go along with the formula, the angle and the mass aren’t included so these don’t affect the period. errors in the experiments could come from starting the stopwatch late, the pendulum swaying, or the string changing in length as the mass moves. a constraint for these experiments is the difficulty of staying consistent with the angle that the pendulum is being dropped from.
