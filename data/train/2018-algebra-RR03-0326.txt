discussion and conclusion

	this experiment asked which of three independent variables: mass of bob, length of string, and/or angle of release affected the period of a pendulum for small swings.  according to the data, only the length of the pendulum affected the period of the pendulum.  in figure 1, it is apparent that many data points and their error bars overlap and the r^2 value is only .07 suggesting little correlation.  in figure 2, for the angle of release, error bars are still overlapping and the r^2 value is again small at .17.  in figure 3 for the length of the pendulum string there are some points at which the error bars may overlap, but this was eliminated by the photogate as seen by the r^2 value of almost one in figure 3b.  therefore the only factor that affects the period of a pendulum is length of string.  the theoretical model is $t=2$ .  it makes sense then that our relationship is not linear but curved (figure 3b).  it also makes sense that mass and angle of release did not affect the period as those are not included in this equation.  random errors associated with this experiment included human errors in measurement.  systematic errors would involve equipment and could be decreased by replacing the equipment and/or increasing the amount of data collected.
