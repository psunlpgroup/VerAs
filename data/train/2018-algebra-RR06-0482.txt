the purpose of this lab was to use newtonâ€™s laws to figure out if the force applied to the system effects the acceleration of the system. the mathematical model of the experiment was $y=0.0025 x + 0.317$ which related to the theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m}$, both equations are linear, which can be seen in the graph above. another force other than the hanging weight would be gravity as it is constantly pulling on the hanging bobbers to move the system to get an acceleration. the mass of the system stays the same within the experiment, all that was changed was where the mass was at a time. if the string was not massless, the extra weight would make the system have a higher acceleration. a larger string mass would have an effect on the acceleration of the cart. a random error could have been not correctly weighing the system. the scale was not an electronic scale so reading the numbers off the scale could have been read wrong. a systemic error could be the data studio tracker as it could have not been calibrated recently and could give inaccurate acceleration/velocity data. a constraint within this experiment would be time because more trials would have been run to get more accurate results.
