	the research question for this experiment was what affects the average time for a pendulum period. the hypothesis was that the string length, mass of the pendulum, and the angle the pendulum was released each have an effect on the time of the period. this experiment shows that the average period time for a pendulum is only affected by the string length and not the mass of the pendulum or the angle the pendulum is released. the equation for a pendulum period is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. the simplified theoretical equation was 2.006 * l^(0.5). the difference in mass showed no effect on the average period time. graph 1 shows no change in the time in seconds of for each trial. the slope remained zero and was linear with an error of +/- 0.033 seconds, the period equation was 1.456 * l^(0.003). which does not fit in the mathematical model for the period time equation model. graph 2 for the angle the pendulum was released also showed no effect on the average period time. the slope remained zero and was linear with an error of +/- 0.006 seconds, the period equation was 1.884 * l^(0.002) which also does not fit into the mathematical model of the period time equation model. based on this data from graph 1 and 



graph 2 the mass and the angle has no effect on the period time. this rejects our hypotheses that the lighter the pendulum the quicker the period and the smaller the angle the shorter the period. graph 3 for the string length showed an increasing linear slope of the time as the string length increased with an error of 0.1 seconds. the period equation for string length was 2.006 * l^(0.05) which is very close to the trend of the mathematical model of the equation for the period time. the difference was very small around 0.002s. this shows that the string length has a significant effect on the average period of a pendulum. this also supports our hypothesis that the shorter the 

string the quicker the average period time is.	 errors for this experiment include random errors such as the uncertainty of 0.1 for the photo-gate. a systematic error would be when measuring 

the string length not measuring accurately the center of mass each time. these errors could both be fixed by using better equipment for measuring the period as well as detecting the center of mass. some constraints of this experiment were that the string length could only go a certain length before hitting the floor, therefore the length could have had more trials and gave a more accurate mathematical model. overall this experiment was success because an affect on time of a  pendulum period was found.
