conclusion:
	the question that was asked at the beginning of this lab was whether length, angle of drop, and mass affected the period of a pendulum. in relation to mass, the claim that was made was that the time of the period would decrease with greater mass. this claim was not valid, as the period time did not change from each mass value. each value for mass meets each other within their uncertainty range, as shown by figure 1. the claim for the angle of drop’s relation to the period was that the period would decrease as the angle did as well. like the mass, however, the data’s uncertainties overlapped, signalling that the period stays the same between each angle, (figure 4). for the length, the claim that was made was as length was increased, the period would increase as well. after testing the length, there was shown to be a positive correlation between the length and the period time of the pendulum, (figure 2).

	the theoretical model we found for our data was $y=2.1325 x^{0.4055}$. after curve fitting with this model, our data very closely followed the theoretical model as shown by figure 3. the biggest error we accounted for was error with regards to reaction time for stopping the stopwatch. we accounted for this error by doing several tests in order to find an average time for each value of mass, length, and angle. additionally, this error was also negated by the use of a photogate in order to accurately record the time for the third lab session. we did not find any systematic errors during our testing. we had multiple constraints in this experiment. we were only able to measure length up to 1.8 meters, to the mathematical model we designed may not apply for longer lengths. we were also limited by the amount of mass available, so greater masses may result in different changes on the pendulum period than the affects we measured.
