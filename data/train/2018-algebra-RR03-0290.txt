discussion &conclusion

	the research question for this experiment was “what impacts the period of a pendulum?” after performing the experiments, we can come to a conclusion. first, based on the string length (graph 1.3), the points on the graph show that there is a positive correlation between the string length and the pendulum since the slope is positive. second, based on the mass (graph 2.3), the points on the graph show that there is no correlation between the period and the mass of the pendulum since the period remained within the standard deviation range even though the mass of the pendulum increased, the slope is zero. lastly, based on the angle (graph 3.3), the points show that there is a positive correlation between the angle at which the string of the pendulum was dropped to the period, the slope is positive. take into consideration that there may have been errors made. a random error could be due to members not hitting the stopwatch at the exact moment that a period had occurred to not rounding to the correct number of significant figures to not letting the pendulum get to its highest potential swing for a period but rather only taking into account the moment right before it. another area for error may have been is when setting up the protractor, the protractor itself may have been held at an angle not completely parallel to the ground, this could misguide the data. systematic error could have occurred in the stopwatch since it had been used throughout this and was the main use for measurement of the period, some may have been slow where some experienced a lag in starting or stopping the stopwatch. overall, this lab was accomplished to the best of mine and group members ability.
