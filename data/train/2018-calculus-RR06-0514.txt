conclusion:
the purpose of this lab was to determine how the acceleration of a system would change when the applied force change.

our resulting data and formula for the experiment showed that as the hanging force of the system increased so did the acceleration. our mathematical model found for the system was is  $y=3.8971 x - 0.0255$ (meters per second squared per newton of force). our r squared value was 0.965 which means our model was a very good fit. we could also check our model by using the formula $f=m a$, as the acceleration in the formula increases so does the force.
the experimental model we found was $y=3.8971 x - 0.0255$ while the theoretical model was $f=m a$ which can be expanded into $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, with the ta given acceleration of 0.6 m/s^2. in the experimental model “y” would be the applied force. mass shows up in the system with the slope because the value of the slope is found by taking 1/ (mass in kg), our mass used was 0.29865 kg. the y-intercept should theoretically be zero but in the experimental model it is 0.0255; this is because of outside factors that affected the system. some of these factors were probably air resistance and friction on the track. these were assumed to be negligible but show up in the model. the outside factors also affected the acceleration of the object because they affect the force. the weight of the string could also affect the acceleration because as the sled moves the string can add weight to the hanging mass. if a massless string was used in the experiment the acceleration would be more accurate and have less error in the end result.
systematic errors could include not accounting for air resistance, friction of the slide, and the effect of the mass on the hanging mass. all of these factors could affect the final acceleration and y-intercept of the theoretical model. it is difficult to avoid or reduce these errors but if you can find the air resistance and friction on the system you could factor those values into the final theoretical model.
the number of trials we performed and the increments of weights we used could affect the generalizability of our results. if we performed more trials and averaged them we could have more accurate data. while performing more trials we could have used smaller weight increments and had more data to compile together which also would have led to more accurate results.
