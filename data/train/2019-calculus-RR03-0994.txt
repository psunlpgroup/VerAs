conclusion made.

the theoretical model for the period of a pendulum is . this equation when .5m is plugged in for l it equals 1.419 seconds. the data fits the model from the graph above with the trendline because when plugged in for the equation of the trendline
 ( it equals 1.414 seconds only being off by .005 seconds. the release angle is not factored into this equation because the length of the pendulum was that one displayed a linear relationship which a trend line could fit inside the error bars.

a random error that was found in the lab was timing the period of the pendulum with a stop watch and a systematic error was mismeasurements in the length of the pendulum. these were fixed by increasing the amount of times the weight went back and forth and having a different person drop the weight and timing the swings.

constraints that could affect the data is only having two hours to complete the lab and the amount of string that was used too.
