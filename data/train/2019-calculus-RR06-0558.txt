conclusion:
The purpose of this experiment was to see how the acceleration changes when you change the force. The three experiments show how the acceleration changes through friction, mass and the change in force. During this experiment other groups similar experiments that we could not do. One these experiments show in Figure 10, represented how friction affects acceleration. The other experiment done by other groups was showing the affect of tilt on the acceleration. The other groups did not share the data, so we use the data provided to us by Professor Bortner. This is represented by Figure 11. 

The random error in this experiment was reading the scales wrong or rounding the numbers incorrectly. The systematic error in this experiment is the error in the equipment. We can reduce the random error by doing repeated measurements. We can reduce systematic error by calibrating the equipment. Our mathematical models are consistent with $F = m a$ because it shows the relationship between mass and force affect acceleration. In the end we proved how acceleration is affected by a change in mass, friction and force.
