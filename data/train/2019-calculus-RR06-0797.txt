discussion and conclusion:

	the purpose of the lab was to develop mathematical models to describe the behavior of the acceleration of the system as caused by the applied force, and to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model.  the two experiments in lab 05 gave us the mathematical model through the figures which graph the acceleration and applied force.  the experiment in lab 06 where we determined the angles of the system caused a change in the applied force and acceleration.  this can be explained through vector forces, now causing differing directions of the forces for the movement due to the new angles.  

	

	the data from these two groups support my group’s results by showing that as the incline increased the change in the values of c1 and c2.  the second groups findings explored a different variable than our experiment on how friction affected the values of c1 and c2 by having an even larger impact than the variance of angles on the acceleration and applied force of the system.  there may have been a few errors present.  we found some random error in the angle results which overall seemed to average out in the results.  the systematic error which could be observed in the lab 05 could be a cause of air resistance, and the surfaces not being perfectly frictionless.  one constraint that may limit our generalizability would be that we were not able to test these results in varied gravity.  we can see that the results are consistent with newton’s second law because we can use force diagrams to model and then predict the results of these labs, and also using the vector components of force we can see why the varied angles would affect the final applied force and acceleration.
