conclusion:

in these experiments we attempted to answer the research question, “what impacts the period of a pendulum?” in lab 1 we explored different factors that would affect this period and we made the claim the increasing rope length, mass, and angle would all increase the time for one period. in lab 2 we analyzed our graphs from lab 1 using error bars and found that the only factor noticeably effecting the period was the length of the rope. lastly in lab 3 we retested the length of the rope variable using a much more accurate instrument (photogate). our tables from lab 1 show that we were right in assuming the length of the string would affect the period, but we found the mass and angle did not. this was done through using a calculated standard deviation to conclude that the values recorded for the mass and angle trials were not different enough within two standard deviations to state that the period is affected. this proved our hypotheses regarding mass and angle to be incorrect. in all three labs random error could be observed as a result of using a human to release the pendulum. however in lab 3 we were able to remove the systemic error that came with the manually operated stop watches and were able to acquire much more accurate data using the photogate. despite the increase in accuracy there are still some constraints used that decrease the repeatability of the experiment. things such as the pendulum and materials used, the room conditions, and the people performing the experiment.
