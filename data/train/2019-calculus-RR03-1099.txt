discussion and conclusion

	the experiments done in labs one, two, and three were done to explain what truly effects the period of a pendulum. the first two experiments with mass and angle of release as the independent variables showed there was no correlation between them and time of the period. the error bars we added overlapped so we could say mas and angle of release had no affect on the time of the periods. when we tested the length in the next experiment with a stopwatch we were able to find a good correlation between the independent variable of length of the pendulum and the dependent variable of time. as the length of the pendulum increased, so did its period. we needed a more precise mathematical model of length vs time so we used a photogate instead of a stopwatch t o get more accurate times. using the photogate, we were able to get a mathematical equation equal $t=2.009 l^{0.52}$ which is very close to the theoretical equation of  . the biggest restriction on the experiment was using stopwatches because human error was terrible and unreliable. using a photogate minimized error so our mathematical equation became a better fit. some random error could have been caused by not dropping the mass of the pendulum correctly.
