conclusion:
from this lab i concluded that the period of a pendulum is dependent on the length from the pivot point to the end of the pendulum. as length increased, the time taken to complete one period also increased. i think that the reason why length affects the period of a pendulum is that it increased the distance the pendulum has to travel, but the force of gravity isn’t affected by length, so the pendulum isn’t falling faster. if mass is increased, the force due to gravity increases on the pendulum, but it also takes more work to move an object with more mass, so the effect of additional mass cancels out. changing the angle does not affect the period either. even if the angle of release is increased, the pendulum will have more time to accelerate but also has to travel a greater distance, so the effect of changing the angle also does not affect the length of the period.
