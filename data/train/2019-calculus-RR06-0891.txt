conclusion

during our experiment, we wanted to know how increasing or decreasing the mass would affect the acceleration of the system. we found that as you change the mass of the hanging weight, the acceleration will increase or decrease. this can be shown by the graphs above when the weight is the independent variable, you can see the acceleration go up or down.  as seen in the picture below our findings do match up from different groups. our two equation that we found were, $a=3.0758 x$ for model. and for model 2 we found 1.0568 * e^(-0.304 * x). we achieved these equations using the graphs above. and these equation support newtons second law, with the relationship between mass and acceleration. some constraints that we thought of were friction, temperature, and air resistance. these could have affected the results.   
in our experiment we wanted to know how magnetic force affects the acceleration of a system. we found that acceleration decreases as we added more magnets, which was out hypothesis. we also found that as more magnets are added into the system c1 decreases and c2 increase. our equation does support the theoretical equation of a system. the acceleration of the system is c1 and friction is c2. our r2 value is greater than 0.99, so we are very confident in our data. some contrasts we faced were the air resistance of the system could have affected the results. we could improve our experiment  by doing more trials and some errors are we didnâ€™t start the track as soon as the data was recording.
