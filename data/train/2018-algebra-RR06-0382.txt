discussion:

	over the course of two experiments we tested how the acceleration of a system changes as the applied force changed. in the experiments the independent variable was the hanging mass. the force excreted by the hanging mass in newtons was calculated by multiplying the mass by 9.8 which is the acceleration due to gravity. the research question was addressed because acceleration of the cart changed as the force changed. the claim that can be made is that as the force due to the hanging mass increased then so too does the acceleration of the cart increase. this statement is justified by the results plotted in figure 1, the graph of mass vs acceleration. the r2 value shows that a linear equation is the best fit due to its value being .9995 which indicates an almost near perfect fit. the slight variation that is preventing a perfect fit of 1.0 could be due to systematic error caused by small amounts of friction or a slight inconsistency in air flow. the error however was very minute and had no great effect on the data as they are not visible in figure 1. 

	data from other groups was also observed so that our results could be compared. one group we looked at was the green team. from their data they obtained the linear equations $y=0.0053 x - 0.0022$. this equation supported our results and conclusion that as mass increased so did acceleration because it was similar to the linear equation we obtained which was $y=0.0051 x - 0.0063$. another group we compared our results to was bronchitis who from their equations obtained the linear function $y=0.0054 x + 0.0297$. in comparison we shared a similar slope however their y intercept was much larger than ours which could be due to a calculation error or systematic error during their experiment. nonetheless they obtained a linear equation that best fit their data which indicated that as hanging mass increased then so did the acceleration, just as we concluded with our experiment and experimental equation. 

	in this experiment we worked with and tested a few equations. first, we looked at the theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ and compared it to our equation $y=0.0051 x-0.0063$ which also happens to be the experimental mathematical model $a=c1 w+c2$ where y is the acceleration (a), .0051 is c1, x is the weight (w), and -.0063 is the y intercept c2. we found that the mathematical model is able to obtain almost an identical acceleration value as the theoretical model which calculates acceleration by dividing force due to hanging mass by mass of the system which was 186g. looking back at figure 1 we can see that the x axis is set to force so and point corresponds to the correct y value (acceleration) just as the theoretical model. a more accurate model however is the enhanced theoretical model, $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. when values are plugged into this equation we get $y=0.0054 x+0.0012$. this shows that our obtained experimental model is almost identical to the enhanced theoretical model thus confirming our conclusion that as hanging mass increases so does the acceleration. 

	 a scenario that could alter the results of the experiment could be if the string connecting the cart and the hanging mass had a non-negligible weight to it. as the mass would be pulled downward and the string went over the pully, more mass would then be in the down ward direction and as a result the acceleration would not increase uniformly but instead have more of a curve that would bend upwards. or if a linear trend was observed the slope which would be used to record the acceleration of the cart would be much steeper indicating a much higher acceleration. 

	some systematic error that was present in this experiment was from the air track which applied very little friction. this error could be reduced if a more efficient a frictionless air track was used. other systematic error was due to the scale used. it had an error of .05 grams. this error could be reduced if a more accurate scale was used such as a digital one. some random error present was due the release of the cart. at some instances the cart was slightly pushed backwards but only by a little or it wasn’t released smoothly and fast enough thus maybe interfering with our obtained acceleration. this error could be reduced if a mechanism was formed which released the cart the same every time. constraints that could limit the generalizability of the results would be if different equipment was used that maybe isn’t as accurate or efficient as the ones we used. maybe an air track that had so much friction the hanging mass had little to no effect on the cart.
