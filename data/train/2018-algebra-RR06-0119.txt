conclusion:
The purpose of Lab 5 and Lab 6 was to determine the relationship between the force of a falling mass pulling a cart of and the acceleration of the cart. In the experiment, to determine the relationship, the mass of the falling object will be changed (IV) to see how it affects the acceleration of the cart (DV). The experiment and the resulting mathematical model both indicate that there is a positive relationship between the force of the object pulling the cart and the acceleration of the cart. According to the Lab 5 graph as the force increases, the acceleration of the cart increases as well. And the results are similar from the two women group and Rayshawn Moore’s group findings.

While our theoretical model isn’t exactly the same as the other group, they both indicate that there is indeed a positive relationship between the force of the falling object and the acceleration of the cart.
The theoretical model is stated as (F-hanging+ F-unknown)/ m- system. Our experimental model is $y=0.0025 x + 0.317$ Our model presents F-hanging as x, 0.0025 represents            (1/m-system), + 0.3176 represents (F-unknown/ m-system), and y represents a. The theoretical model written in the form of our experimental model can be written as                        $a=\frac{x}{m}+ \frac{f_{unknown}}{m_{system}}$. The unknown forces may be the friction of the track, since they had a few problems with simulating a frictionless surface or it could be the mass of the string, which is not factored into our calculations due to its small mass. If we were to use a massless string to pull the cart, then the uniform acceleration may increase. During the experiment there was one systematic error during the last trial on lab 5 when the acceleration was lower than expected according to the mass of the falling object. We couldn’t fix the error, therefore we had to implement the data in our graph. In order to avoid this mistake in the future, a better track would be needed to reduce this error.
