discussion and conclusion

	after gathering and analyzing the data for the experiment, we can now answer our research question of “what impacts the periods of a pendulum for small swings”. the experiment for mass v period determines that mass has no effect on the period. the pattern of this graph still hold after applying error bars. mass v period shows a slight positive correlation with a theoretical equation of $y=0.0004 x + 1.3$ and a standard deviation of .136565. the experiment for angle v period determines that the angle of release has no effect on the period. the pattern of this graph still held after applying error bars. angle v period showed a negative correlation with a theoretical equation of  $y=0.0004 x + 1.8$ and a standard deviation of .005774. the experiment for length v period determines that it has an effect on period. as the string length increased, the period time increased. the pattern of this graph still held after applying error bars. length v period showed no correlation with a theoretical equation of $y=0.0109 x + 0.884$ and a standard deviation of .707109. some random errors in this experiment was that a bump in the table caused an error in the swing of the pendulum, while releasing the pendulum the arm was bumped and the trajectory of the pendulum was messed up. some systematic errors were the reaction of stopping and starting the stopwatch and the string wasn’t fully extended while measuring, thus giving a measurement that is incorrect. to reduce these random and systematic errors, one should do this in a closed environment. using a sensor stopwatch will help for the delay in manually operating one. also using a more dense string will help with taking measurements since the string will be fully extended.
