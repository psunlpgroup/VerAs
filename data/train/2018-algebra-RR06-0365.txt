the purpose of this lab was to determine if the force applied to an object will affect its acceleration. after we were done with the experiment, we concluded that the amount of force applied does affect the acceleration. group 5â€™s data on graph 1 shows a positive linear relationship. they had a mathematical model of $y=0.0053 x - 0.095$ with an r2 value of 0.989. the theoretical model is $a=\frac{m2 g}{m1+m2}$ . group 5 had a y-intercept due to different types of error or forces. one of the forces that could have acted on it was air resistance and another could be friction because we did not work on a frictionless surface. this error could not be fixed in our experiment. another error that could have occurred would have been experimental error. stopping and starting the datastudio was very difficult because if you did not stop it in time, the line of the graph would fall causing the slope to be inaccurate. this could be solved by only taking the line of best fit of the middle of a line. systematic errors could have also occurred if the datastudio or balance was not calibrated correctly. this problem could be fixed by making sure both systems were calibrated before using them. the other item that affected our experimental model was mass. mass is in the equation; however, we cannot be sure where exactly it is. the mass can be seen in the theoretical model because it is divided by the mass of the system. if there was a non-massless string that connected the hanging mass to the cart, it would affect the uniform acceleration because the mass of the cart and string stays the same so the acceleration would increase at the same rate. however, the magnitude of the acceleration would be lower because there would be more mass than usual. there were very few constraints to this experiment. one of the constraints was not having more bobbers to test further accelerations and another was not having a frictionless surface to run the experiment on.
