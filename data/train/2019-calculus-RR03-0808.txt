conclusion: in this lab, we were asked to determine what affects the period of a pendulum. we tested different string lengths, different bob masses, and different release angles. in the first experiment we varied each of the factors to determine which had the greatest affect on the period of the pendulum. based off of the data in table1, table2, table3, graph1, graph2, and graph3, we determined that the mass of the pendulum bob has a negligible effect on the period (table 2). we also determined that the length of the string has a large affect on the period because the times varied the most when we changed the length of the string (table 1). we also determined that the release angle has a very slight effect on the period (table 3). the theoretical mathematical equation is exponential (graph 4) and fits our data very well. we can tell it fits very well because of the r^2 value of .9994 (graph 4). there were random errors in the first two experiments because we were using stopwatches to time the period, which were not accurate. we omitted these random errors in the third experiment by using photogates. the photogates gave us a much more accurate measurement on the time because they stop the time automatically. the constraints we had in this experiment were mainly time and materials. we only had the lab period to complete the experiments, which are about two hours long. we also were only given a limited amount of materials. we were constricted to our lab room, so we could not have a string length of say 15 feet. we also only had limited mass for the bob and couldnâ€™t put a 15kg kettle ball on the end of it. 



this work is from other groups in our lab class. they came up with the same result that the length of the string has the most effect on the period of the pendulum.
