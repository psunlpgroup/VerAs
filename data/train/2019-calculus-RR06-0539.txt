discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to test the relationship of external forces on a system.  there were types of external force tested, the first being an applied force and the end of a cart string system on an air track the second being friction acting on that same system.  with this we measured the acceleration of the system and were able to calculate the mathematical models that are able to describe the behavior of the system.  

for the three experiments in this lab we were able to create mathematical models for each by plotting the data obtained into excel and creating a trendline for the data and using the equation for that line as our model.  for the first experiment our mathematical model turned out to be $y=0.3048 x - 1.076$.  to put it into terms of the lab $a=\frac{0.3048}{m^{1.076}}$.  for the second experiment the mathematical model obtain through our data was $y=2.761 x + 0.026$ and to put this in terms of physics it would turn into $a = 2.761 f_{applied} + 0.0268$.  for the third and final part of this lab there were a total of three mathematical models obtained since this experiment included trials with three different levels of friction.  for high friction the model included $y = 0.0177 x - 0.0539$, for medium friction the model was $y = 0.0176 x - 0.0374$, and finally for low friction $y = 0.0176 x - 0.0227$.  for each of the models, to get it into terms of the lab just replace each y with acceleration and each x with force applied.  by observing all the models, we are able to come to the conclusion that as you increase the applied force, the acceleration of the system will also increase.  this means, in this lab, that when we add more hanging weight the acceleration will increase.  we are also able to conclude, from the set of three models, that as we increase the friction on the system the acceleration goes down as a result.  also, for this lab, this means that when we add more magnets to the system the acceleration will decrease.  for the graphs in this lab the error bars were so small that we are not able to see them

	as our group tested how friction affected the acceleration of a system group 3 and 5 tested how the tilt of a system affects its acceleration.  group 3’s mathematical model included three equations for three different trials.  their first trial’s model, at an angle of 1.3 degrees, was $y = 2.894 x + 0.215$, their second trial’s model, at an angle of 1.84 degrees, was $y = 2.769 x + 0.322$, and their final trial’s model, at an angle of 3.16 degrees, was $y = 2.768 x + 0.538$.  with these models they were able to come to the conclusion that as you increase the angle of the tilt towards the sensor, it increases the y intercept.  group 5 also had three different mathematical models, but where they differed is they measured their change in centimeter instead of an angle.  their first trial’s model, at a raise of 1 cm, was $y = 3.022 x + 0.0816$, their second trial’s model, at a raise of 3 cm, was $y = 3.09 x + 0.149$, and their final trial’s model, at raise of 6 cm, was $y = 3.065 x + 0.284$.  group 5 also came to the same conclusion that the y intercept increased as the tilt increases but they also noted that the slope stays the same and that net force will still equal zero.  these results helped me understand that all the slopes of the line were close enough to declare them as the same, and we were also able to conclude that our y intercepts were change as our slopes were not.

the errors that were involved with this lab were mainly systematic errors, which included the scale not being calibrated and rotary motion detector not being calibrated properly.  these errors would only affect our data, our conclusion would still remain the same.  in the lab there were a very minuscule error in the rotary motion detector, but it was not significant enough to affect our data.  there was one random error that we notice while performing the lab.  when adding friction to the cart we noticed that the acceleration would not correlate with the other data and we predicted that as we used the air track longer that it would start to over heat and not perform as well.  this error was not as noticeable when there were not weights on the cart, but as we started to add more weight this error became more frequent.  to try to combat this error we could have tried to clean the air track allow for better air flow and wait longer intervals between trials to allow it to cool down.

one of the constraints in this lab was the fact that this track was not entirely frictionless.  this is still a small amount of friction that affects the motion of the cart.  another constraint in this lab was the fact that there was a limited amount of weight that we could put on the system until the system would not move.  also, if a heavy string was used there would be the issue that force applied would increase over time causing our data to change.  this would also result in our graph becoming exponential instead of linear.

all of our mathematical models support newton’s second law that $f = m a$.  we can derive the equation $a =\frac{f}{m}$ to calculate the acceleration.  in all the experiments performed we see that as we keep the mass consistent and increase the force applied the acceleration of the system will increase.  we were able to increase the applied force by adding weight to the end of the string and releasing it on a rotary motion sensor.  in the third experiment performed we added another variable, friction, and was kept consist with newton’s second law.  this was a result of the sum of the forces becoming a smaller value.
