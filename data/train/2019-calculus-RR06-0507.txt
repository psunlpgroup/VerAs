conclusion and discussion:



the purpose of these labs was to find out if the changing of the applied force of the hanging mass affect on the system’s acceleration. and also test and determine which variables affect acceleration.  form these three experiments we tried to develop the mathematical models to get a graph which shows the relationship between forces and acceleration. by changing the hanging mass gradually, we got different values of the acceleration which were represented on above graphs and also got the linear models. in the linear models, the y is equal the system’s acceleration and the x is 1/kg in the system. the variable represents the acceleration and the constant represents the force. the acceleration could be positive which means increasing  or  it could be negative which means decreasing. in the polynomial equation, the y represents the acceleration, the (x^2) is velocity and x is force with the constant 1/kg. then we got the acceleration constant. the errors on this lab mostly random error but we could have some systematic errors such as the weight of the bobbers could not be all have the same weight so that could affect on our calculated values. the random errors are related to the human error. the constraints of this lab was that we could not change the gravity. according to this equation $f=m a$ which the only variable could change the system’s mass. the mathematical models we used support newtons second law $f=m a$.
