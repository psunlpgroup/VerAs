	the objective of these labs and experiments where to determine what affected the periods in pendulum. carrying out the experiments while changing only 1 variable at a time helped not only address whether the period can be changed, but specifically what feature can be changed to increase or decrease the period. 

	the data acquired in experiments 1 and 3, the points all lie within the uncertainty values, suggesting a high probability that the true value does not change as the value of the variable changes. with graph 2 and 4 however, the points lie outside of the uncertainty. graph 2 still has some overlapping, but the data on the far right clearly goes over the uncertainty values of the far-left side. graph 4 does not have any overlapping data, proving that as length increases, the time a pendulum takes to complete 1 period also increases.
	the theoretical mathematical value of the period of a pendulum compared to the length is $y=2.01 x^{0.5}$. compared to our graph number 4, which had a curve of $y=1.9958 x^{0.5065}$ which is under the uncertainty of ±2σ. also the r2 values where identical to the theoretical values. none of the other variable are present in the theoretical mathematical values of a pendulum, further supporting our conclusion that the angle or release (given that the angle was small enough) and the mass had no effect in the period.
