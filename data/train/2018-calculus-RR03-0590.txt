discussion and conclusion:

	in this lab we were trying to find out what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. the first lab helped us eliminate that mass affected the period of the pendulum by showing no change happened when more mass was added. the second lab helped by eliminating angle of release being a factor in the period of the pendulum and prove that length of string was a factor in the period of the pendulum. the graphs can confirm all of this with the mass as the iv you can easily tell that is not a factor, then the error bars can confirm this by looking where they overlap. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of the pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ where g is the gravitational acceleration and l is the length of the string, when you compare this to our model $y = 0.2663 x^{0.4468}$ which is the best fit line for our data points in our graph. the model we came up with is close but not perfect to the true model and this is because we did not factor in gravitational acceleration into our data. some of the errors that are present were the releasing of the pendulum, when release a force could have been added or it could have been released at an angle position from the plane. another error is the measurement of the angle of release and the measurement of the length of the string. to reduce these errors, we could have a dial caliper and a latch that releases the pendulum, so no force is added, and that pendulum is on a plane. a constraint is the time for some of the trials.
