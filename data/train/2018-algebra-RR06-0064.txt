discussion & conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to examine how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes by using a cart on a surface blowing air to reduce friction and finding its acceleration based on the slope of a velocity vs time graph as given through datastudio.

our mathematical model given by our data (table 2) and graph (figure 1) is $y=5.5209 x - 0.051$ with an r^2 value of 0.9997, which is very close to one. this indicates a very strong positive linear relationship. the error bars are within a small enough range to have this be a viable relationship. moreover, the mathematical relationship determined between acceleration (m/s^2) and applied force (n) supports the hypothesis we made and makes sense based on what has been discussed in lecture; if $f=m a$ then an increase in the magnitude of force will result in a greater acceleration when mass is kept constant.


the data from group 1, as shown in figure 2, supports our group’s claim that the acceleration of a system will increase as the force of the hanging mass increases. they also show their mathematical model of $y=0.3123 x+0.2789$ with an r^2 value of 0.9374. although this indicates a slightly less strong relationship, their uncertainty (error margin) is still small enough to support a valid claim.

the data from group 5, as shown in figure 3, also supports our group’s claim that increasing the force of hanging masses will also increase the acceleration. they had a mathematical model of $y=4.6144 x-0.0227$. their uncertainty (margin of error) is also within a small enough range to support a valid claim of the direct positive relationship between applied force and acceleration. the data from both groups further supports our claim by corroborating it. 

the theoretical model is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, while the experimental mathematical is $a=\frac{f}{m}+c2$, where c2 is the friction coefficient. our model (seen in graph 1) is $a=5.5209 f-0.0511$. in the actual model of $f= m a$ , the slope of the line will be 1/msys. however, in our experimental model, mass will be (f+0.0511)/a. this factors the effect of friction and other outside factors such as air resistance into our model. both friction and air resistance will slightly decrease resulting acceleration, which is why our coefficient is negative. an enhanced theoretical model gives $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, which includes exterior forces into the acceleration, which is more applicable to real-world situations and thus the experimental model we determined from this lab.

if the string used to connect the small weight to the cart had appreciable mass, then the cart would not undergo uniform acceleration. a string with appreciable mass would cause the acceleration to increase because more weight would be added to the hanging mass as the system progresses forward, and as we have discovered in this lab, a greater amount of hanging mass will increase acceleration.

possible random error could include inconsistencies in weighing the masses, which may cause our force to be less accurate. we can reduce this error by including the uncertainty into our data, as well as being as precise as possible when measuring. possible systematic errors include calibration of the analytical balance used to weight the mass, consistency of air vacuum force applied, and calibration of datastudio system. these systematic errors may decrease the accuracy of the mathematical model determined and can be remedied by correctly calibrating instruments.

this experiment is constrained because the environmental effects will prevent us from determining the exact theoretical model. the friction, air resistance, and slight mass of our string all limit the generalizability because it will be different in every experiment. this is shown by the minor differences in the data between my group (figure 1) and groups 1 and 5 (figures 2 and 3 respectively).
