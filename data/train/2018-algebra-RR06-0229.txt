discussion and conclusion

	

the research question of how the acceleration of a system changes when applied force changes was answered during these two lab periods. in the first week, the data showed that there was a positive correlation between applied force and acceleration. in other words, as applied force increased, so did acceleration, supporting the prediction. the data could be represented by the mathematical model $y=4.6144 x - 0.0227$ where y is acceleration and x is force and an r^2 value of .9974. although not identical, this model supports the theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m}$, which would yield straight line. the enhanced theoretical equation of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ was found during the october 3rd lab period. when given an acceleration of .6 m/s^2, the applied force was solved for, and utilizing this applied force in experimentation, the calculated acceleration was .592 m/s^2, which is relatively close to the expected value.

	     as seen in figures 2 and 3 above, the findings of other groups within this section were similar. group 3, having the same prediction, also found that there was a positive correlation between applied force and acceleration. their experimental mathematical model was $y=5.5209 x-0.0511$. therefore, the slope of their data was within 1 of ours. group 2 also hypothesized that the applied force directly affects the acceleration of a system. their experimental mathematical model was $y=4.7453 x + 0.0775$, which also had a slope within 1 of ours. although, not exact it is clear that the findings of other groups supported ours.

	    it can be said that the main reason that the experimental mathematical model did not exactly match the theoretical model, and that the enhanced theoretical equation could not be exactly shown was friction. friction was considered negligible in this experiment, but it is not realistic to assume there is absolutely no friction. this is why the experimental results are very close, but not exact to the theoretical results. other constraints in this experiment include the potential inaccuracy of equipment like the triple beam balance, which would skew the data for the mass of the system and applied force or perhaps inconsistency of air output from the vacuum skewing the measurements of acceleration. also, in this experiment, the mass of the string was considered insignificant, but supposing the string was heavy, the acceleration would decrease. the heavy string would cause an increase in the mass of the system. since $a=\frac{f}{m}$, using the same applied forces, would yield a smaller acceleration. 

	     it is also important to note the random errors in this experiment, which could have been switching a bob with another on accident, skewing the measurements for applied force, or perhaps inconsistency of air output from the vacuum skewing the measurements of acceleration. the bobs could be labeled to prevent mix-ups. a systematic error could have been incorrectly calibrating the triple beam balance. which would result in values for mass of the system and applied force that were either too high or too low, thus causing misrepresented accelerations. an analytical balance could be more capable of delivering accurate results, as it does not require visual estimation. 

	     considering all constraints and possible random answers listed above, it explains why findings between all groups are similar, but not exact. however, the findings are significant enough to say that there is an existing correlation between applied force and acceleration. the prediction that there is a positive correlation between the two was correct.
