we set out to test the effects of hanging weight, weight on the cart, and incline/decline on our systems. the results of the hanging weight tests show that there is a significant increase in acceleration as hanging weight increases (fig. 1) with a trendline of $a = 0.0021 f + 0.2499$ (r2 is 0.8769). this is around the expected results. the results of the cart weight tests show that there is a significant decrease in acceleration as weight increases (fig. 2) with a trendline $a=147.39 m^{-1}$ (r2 is 1) which is a near perfect model for the expected results. the results of the two inclines are linear trendlines of $a=0.011 f + 0.1665$ (r2 is 0.541) and $a=0.019 f + 0.1149$ (r2 is 0.7557) (fig. 3, 4). these show decreasing acceleration as incline increases. this shows the expected results of the inclines. the results of the decline is a linear trendline of $a=0.0007 f + 0.2602$ (r2 is 0.6133) (fig. 5). this shows the expected increase of acceleration compared to the two inclines. 

the constraints of this test were the low number of tests for each experiment. the weight dispersion of each test was low. a higher dispersion would result in more accurate results and therefore higher r2 values.
