discussion and conclusion:

	in this experiment we tested whether the mass of the bob, the string length, and the angle of release influenced the time period of the pendulum. we found, as the above graphs suggest, that the mass of the bob and the angle of release had no significant effect on the time period. for the graph of mass vs. time period and angle vs. time period there were standard deviation values of 0.0544977 and 0.0477493 respectively. since the standard deviation bars overlap in both graphs, we can be confident in our data. the values were consistent throughout each trial with variation likely due to human error. however, in week 1 we found that the length of the string did in fact seem to influence the time period, so we continued to experiment with the string length in future weeks. this graph had a standard deviation of 0.2421776 with overlapping error bars, so we have great confidence in this data as well. using stopwatches to measure the length of stringâ€™s effect on the time period produced a linear graph with a positive slope. however, when we used the much more accurate photogate timing system for more trials, we found it was an exponential relationship. 

theoretical model is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$
derived model is  $t= 1.9961 l^{0.5045}$

	the theoretical model is $y= 2.0071 x^{0.5}$ which is very similar to our derived model of $t= 1.9961 l^{0.5045}$. since our r2 value was 0.9997 we have great confidence in our power curve and can assume it fits with the theoretical model. when we made our string .5m the theoretical model computes a period of 1.419s. when we used the same length of string in our experiment, we calculated a period of 1.407s. the similarity in these values suggests that our derived model fits with theoretical model, but the discrepancy between the two values could have been caused by a number of factors.

	unlike in a theoretical situation, our experiment was subject to air resistance and friction. this is a systematic error that could have affected all of our values throughout all experiments as we were not performing the experiment in a setting without air resistance and friction. in a theoretical situation the pendulum would continue to move with identical periods after being released. our pendulum will eventually come to a stop due to air resistance and friction, which will affect our values for the time period after multiple swings. systematic error was present in the mass of the bob. when we actually weighed the masses we used in the experiment they were slightly off their recorded value. this error would be consistent throughout every trial, but it could have caused the difference in our calculated and theoretical values. random error was possible in the release of the pendulum. both a misaligned angle and a force being accidently exerted on the pendulum as it was released could affect our calculated values. our only real constraint was time. if we had more class time we could have completed many more trials. this could give us a chance to find what angle and mass produced the most accurate period measurements, and we could have completed many trials with those values. since our data already is similar to the theoretical data, this could have made it even more exact.
