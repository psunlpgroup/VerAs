Results and Discussion:
The research question investigated for this lab was the impact of mass of the bob, the length of the string, and the angle of release on the period of a pendulum swing. The three experiments performed to investigate the impact on the period helped identify what has an impact and what does not. Referring to the data collected in data table 7 and graphed in figure 2, the relationship between the mass and the time was not significant because the error bars of the points overlap with one another. The overlap indicates that the mass vs time is insignificant and therefore does not have an impact on the period of a pendulum swing. The points on figure 2 were not significant as well because the times fluctuated as the mass increased. If the equivalency criterion is +/- 2σ, the data would still remain insignificant. The second experiment was angle vs time, with the data in table 6 and graph in figure 1. The slope of the graph is small enough to indicate that the relationship between the angle of release and time is not significant and therefore does not impact the time of a pendulum swing. Figure 1 shows that there is a best fit line and an R2 is .996 which seems to prove that there is a slight correlation between angle vs time. The error bars on figure 1 are also small and do not overlap. It also indicates that If the equivalency criterion is +/- 2σ, the data points would show significance. This may be because errors were made within the experiment itself and the accuracy and precision are off. The angles tested as well as their range could have been too large to determine precise measurements. While it does show otherwise on the graph, the small size of the slope and the reality is that the angle of release does not impact the time of a pendulum swing and there should have been more trials to prove it. The third experiment performed was the length vs time, shown in data table 8 and graph in figure 3. The line was a power line with an equation of $y=0.285 x^{0.4319}$. The graph concludes a positive correlation between the length of the string and the period of a pendulum swing. The error bars are so small that they are not visible on the graph, indicating that there is a significant relationship between these two variables. If the equivalency criterion is +/- 2σ, the data would still be significant. These experiments were all performed in lab 01 to identify what factors impact the period of a pendulum swing. During lab 02, as mentioned above in the description of table 9, an experiment with constant mass, length and angle was performed with 10 trials in order to identify errors in the data as well as to estimate ranges of uncertainty of the measuring technique. The smaller the standard deviation, the closer the measurements are to the mean, which indicates a smaller amount of random error. The standard deviation for the data in table 9 was 0.01841. Lab 03 experiment was used to create a mathematical model for the independent variable that did impact the time of a pendulum swing, the length of the string. A photogate was used to repeat the length vs time experiment with greater precision and therefore smaller error bars. The relationship between the independent (length) and dependent (time) variables was not linear but a power curve. The error bars were unnoticeable in the graph (figure 4) due to the fact that they were small and because of the small equivalency criterion. The uncertainty was already given in the experiment as 0.001s based on the uncertainty of the photogate. Although the data collected for angle of release vs time (figure 1) indicates significance, the TA in the lab said not to test the variable because these results may have errors due to the fact that there is no significance for the angle vs time data in reality. 
The theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum swing is       $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$               The variables were substituted for their values (g is 981cm/s2) and the equation became     $T=0.2006 l^{1.2}$       . The equation indicates that the theoretical value of C1 is 0.2005 and the value for C2 is 0.5. These theoretical values were compared to the values recorded using the line of best fit equation. For the Angle vs Time data from lab 01 (table 6 and figure 1), the data obtained showed a relationship between the angle of release and the time, but there may have been other factors that affected the data obtained (lack of precision and trials). The angle is not part of the theoretical equation and therefore is not important when determining the time of the period of a pendulum swing. For the mass vs time data from lab 01 (table 7 and figure 2), the data supports that the relationship between the mass of the bob and the time of a period of a pendulum swing is insignificant. Mass is also not a variable in the theoretical equation and therefore is not important when determining the time of the period of a pendulum swing. For the length vs time data from lab 01 (table 8 and figure 3), the best fit equation was $y=0.285 x^{0.4319}$. The numbers in the equation are close to the numbers determined for C1 (0.2005) and the value for C2 (0.5), indicating the data as significant and the length as a factor in determining the time of the period of a pendulum swing. For the length vs time data from lab 03 (table 10 and figure 4), the best fit equation was     $y=0.2598 x^{0.4387}$             The numbers in the equation are close to the numbers determined for C1 (0.2005) and the value for C2 (0.5), indicating the data has a complementary experimental mathematical dependence to the theoretical mathematical model. The lab data supports the theoretical model from the length vs time data from labs 01 and 03. An example length can be used in the theoretical equation to show the significant relationship can be performed like in part L in lab 03. The time it takes for the period of a pendulum swing was calculated based on a length of 0.5m is  T is 1.419 seconds. This indicates the significance of the relationship between length of the string and the time of the period of a pendulum swing. 
There were random and systematic errors present within the experiment. Some of the systematic errors include using an uncalibrated scale for weighing the mass of the bob and using a tape measure that could have been stretched out from years of use. Systematic errors are one sided errors that result when the assumed and actual measurements are different. These errors can be limited by repeating measurements and taking averages or even calibrating the scale before usage and compare the tape measure to another one. Random errors in the experiments are is  not looking head on/at eye level when measuring the length and angle of the string, delays in starting/stopping the stopwatch which may skew the results, and over/underestimations when it comes to measuring accurate angle or length with a ruler or protractor based on the tick marks. Random errors are two sided errors that result from the experimental technique or measuring device. These errors can be reduced by repeating the measurements and taking an average or by improving the measurement methods. Some constraints in this experiment that limited the generalizability of the results include the measurement methods for lab 01. Using a protractor to determine the angle is not as accurate as other devices to improve the results. There is a lot of room for random error, as mentioned above, because of the measurement methods. Using a tape measure and assuming whether to go up or down a tick mark also limits the accuracy of results. Another constraint is the way the bob on the pendulum was positioned which varied a bit when it was hung in the loop of string. There are many constraints and errors that could potentially skew the data of these experiments.
