conclusion

the question for this lab experiment was, “what impacts the period of a pendulum for the small swings?” after finishing the three experiments we conclude that based on the angle graph the points did not overlap and the error bars were the same exact size. this told us that the angle did not influence the period of the pendulum. for the length graph the points did not overlap and the error bars were also the same size which told us that the length also did not influence the period of the pendulum. lastly the graph for mass, none of the points overlapped just as the other two graphs. the error bars were also the same size so we concluded that this did not have an effect on the period of the pendulum. systematic errors that could have occurred due to having bad measurements of the angles or inaccurate stopwatch times. random errors that could have occurred due to incorrect number rounding  of sig figs.
