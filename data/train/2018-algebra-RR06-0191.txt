conclusion and discussion

after the experiment was completed, the hypothesis that the acceleration will increase as the force of the pulley increases was approved and supported while carrying out the trials. the three trials for four different masses was completed by measuring the acceleration and calculating the force of each trial. the hanging mass went in increments of 9.7g, 19.5g, 29.6g, and 39.3g, this was based on the number of bobs that were hanging on the string. it was proven that the acceleration increased as the hanging mass increased. the acceleration ranged all the way from .476 m/s2 at 9.7 grams, all the way to 1.92 m/s2 at 39.3 grams. the equation came from the four averages of each mass giving the $y=4.9403 x + 0.0076$. from the uncertainties found, they were not significant enough to change or have an effect on the value of the acceleration. gravity was the extra force acting on the system. the experiment should only be done in an environment where there is little to no friction, this is because force would have needed to be added into the force of the equation. the metal railing that the cart was on could not be 100% guaranteed to be frictionless. also, the weights limit the air resistance acting on the system. within newtonâ€™s 2nd law ($f=m a$), the mass of the system helps to identify the force. the systematic error came from the data studio program as well as the error of the scale having an uncertainty of 0.001 grams. our calculated friction and groups 2 calculated friction were both close to 0, therefor had minimal effects on the acceleration. after the trials were done the hypothesis was proven that the force increased as the mass and acceleration increased.
