conclusion:

	these experiments were conducted in order to determine which of the variables, angle of release, length of pendulum, and weight of pendulum, affected the time it takes for a pendulum to complete a single oscillation. in part one, these three independent variables were tested using the apparatus described in figure 1 and a stopwatch. the experiment described in figure 2 had an r^2 value of .93. these values look fairly linear, and with the r^2 value 1, it is possible that angle does contribute to oscillation time. in the experiment described in figure 3 weight is compared to oscillation period. the r^2 value is .138, showing that there is no correlation between weight and oscillation time. finally, figure 4 shows that most likely length is capable of changing oscillation time, with an r^2 of .984. when rerunning the length experiment under more refined measuring, via photogate, it is better illustrated that length does affect oscillation time. with a higher n, and far more accurate time measurement, length not only gives an r^2 that is practically 0, but the method generates small error bars, showing that there is no overlap between values. since there is no overlap, the r^2 values is more valid. this is distinct to the photogate measure values, as other r^2â€™s are less reliable due to error. in conclusion, length is the only independent variable that can change oscillation time, the dependent variable.
