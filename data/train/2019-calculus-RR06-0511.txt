discussion and conclusion:

lab 05 studied the effects of mass and applied force on the acceleration of an object. through lab 05 our team has produced mathematical models that may help in calculating the effects of each of the tested independent variables on acceleration. lab 06 tested variables that may affect the mathematical models produced in lab 05. with the mathematical models in the form $y= c1 x + c2$ lab 06 looked into identifying what produced the values of c1 and c2 and what factors may affect these values. our team studied the affect of introducing magnets to the system.



through labs 05 and 06 our team has determined that both mass of the system and applied force greatly affects the acceleration of the system, the number of magnets acting on the system also affects the acceleration of the system; changing both c1 and c2 values in the presented mathematical models. for the acceleration vs. applied force experiment in lab -5 the mathematical model obtained was is   $y=0.144 x â€“ 0.0175$ obtained from graph 1 with y being acceleration in m/s^2 and x applied force in newtons. this leaves us to conclude that the c1 value of 0.144 has units of n^(-1)m/s^2 and c2 value having units of m/s^2. lab 05 experiment 2 showed the effect of mass on acceleration, the mathematical model for this experiment is is  $y=c1 e^{c2x}$ obtained from graph 2 with y being acceleration in m/s^2 and x being mass in kilograms. expected units for c1 (0.3927) and c2 (-0.002) are m/s^2 and kg^(-1) respectively. lab 06 provided the mathematical models trial 1 is  no magnets is  $y=0.1228 x + 0.014$, trial 2 is  2 magnets is  $y= 0.1172 x +0.0069$, trial 3 is  4 magnets is  $y= 0.1124 x - 0.004$ these models show that as the number of magnets acting on the object increase the c1 and c2 values decreases.
the results of the group#3 magnet experiments agree with our conclusion as shown in figure 1. their data supports our claim that increasing number of magnets acting on the system decreases the values of both c1 and c2.

inclined experiment results led them to conclude that increasing angle of release affects the acceleration of the cart as shown in figure 2.
random and systematic errors and what to do to reduce them is 
the rope attaching the hanging bobs and the cart may have stretched between experiments; this change in length would cause inconsistencies in the measured values. in order to reduce the inconsistencies in the length of string we could use a string made of a material that is not as stretchable, and check the length before and after conducting the experiments to ensure that the string is still the same length. when comparing our results with other teams results differences may be due to different starting points or even using a different sized pulley.
constraints in the experiment that limits generalizability of results.
factors such as wind and air resistance may affect the acceleration of the object. similarly friction force affects the acceleration of the system. the effect of these factors can only truly be eliminated in a vacuum, factors such as these limit the generalizability of the results mentioned above.
how experimental mathematical models are consistent with newtons second law
newtons second law states that sum $f=m a$, this means that $a= \frac{f}{m}$. our experimental mathematical models agree with the relationships between the independent variable (mass / applied force) and the dependent variable (acceleration. our mathematical models indicate that as mass increases, the acceleration of the system decreases, and as force increases the applied acceleration increases.
