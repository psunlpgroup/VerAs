discussion and conclusion

how does the length of the string effect the period of the pendulum?

before this experiment was conducted, it was predicted that the longer the string got, the longer the period became. as the data was recorded into table 1, our group realized that the prediction we made was correct. when the data is put into a mathematical model, the trendline fits a power curve the best. we know that our model is accurate because it is within range of the true theoretical model of $y=1.99 x^{0.05}$. as long as all other variables are kept constant, then the equation to get the mathematical model should be near the true theoretical model. some errors that could have happened were the angle not being the exact same every time, and the measurement of period time not being accurate. the photogate reduced error in the period time measurement because it only had an error standard deviation of 0.001. the error in angle could be reduced by having a holding device instead of a human releasing it every time. some constraints could include the length we could make the string, and the max amount of weight we could add. the apparatus provided could only go down to a certain length, so we couldnâ€™t obtain a large spread of data.
