discussion and conclusion:
the research question for the labs was: what effects mass 2 during the experiments on the air track? this question was answered by performing two experiments to test the effect of acceleration on mass 2 with a horizontal surface and with a surface tilted forward. the difference in the angles allowed us to see the different effects of acceleration. 

the experiment with the hanging weight as the independent variable (mass 2) was address in the research question which was then tested through two experiments. the question addresses mass 2 which is the same as the hanging mass. a claim that can be made is that as mass 2 increases, the acceleration increases as well and vice versa. this is represented in the graphs of acceleration vs hanging weight which clearly shows a positive linear slope. there are no error bars because they are too small to be included.

based on the model 1 from group 2, it is very similar to our equation of $y=\frac{x}{2500000000000000} + 2.89$. the reason our values are different is due to the different masses used and/or the varying tilt heights of our air tracks. we agree with the calculated data from group 2.
these are the findings from group 6. while their data is different from ours, we agree with their data because it is like ours with the exception that theirs is opposite. we accept that the values will be slightly different due to the different masses used as well as the height of the tilt used. 
the theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by a single force is $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ . this is true with our calculated experimental equation of $a = c1 w+c2$. c1*w is the force from our experiment divided by the mass of the system. c2 of the experimental equation is very close to 0 therefore it is so. with it equal to 0 it makes the two equations almost exact. the results from the fitting curve shows that the mass of the system relates to the force. this can be seen in the graphs from the experiments shown above. 
the enhanced theoretical equation is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. as stated earlier, the c1*w from the experimental equation accounts for the f/msys. however, in our experiment, since friction is not considered. there are no external forces acting on the object except air resistance, also considered to be zero. since the external forces are not considered, the graphs will not represent them. however, if the air resistance and friction were to be added, our graphs would show more error in the fitting curves since they will influence the calculations made. 
by using a heavier wire for connecting the hanging mass, this would add more mass to the system which would in turn cause the acceleration to increase since the mass in also increasing. the prediction is that the heavier string would cause the acceleration to increase.
the random error in the experiment was determining the starting distance of the object. this was measured closely each time but could still cause error. to reduce this error, the distance would need to be measured by a machine. the systematic error is cause by the factor error from the tools used to measure the velocity. this can not be reduced unless the machine/tool was redesigned to have less error.
the two constraints of the experiments are the friction and air resistance. if they were to be included in the calculations, the calculations would be able to be the most accurate. since they are not, the calculations must be generalized.
