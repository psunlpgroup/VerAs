discussion and conclusion

	over the course of the past three lab periods, we were investigating what affects the period of a pendulum. in order to accomplish this, my lab group and i experimented with three different factors to see whether a relationship could be found between the factors and the period of a pendulum. the first factor, the length of the pendulum, was tested by changing the length of the pendulum and recording the period for each length. we found that it as the length increased, the period would increase as well. the other two factors, the mass and the angle of release of the pendulum, were found not to have a relationship with the period of the pendulum. our claims are valid because the error bars for each of them is small, showing that the data collected was accurate. 

the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum with the length of the pendulum was found to be best represented with the power curve. we know this because our data in the first lab and the third lab showed that the power function had a higher correlation than a linear function. since the power curve had a higher r squared value than the linear or exponential curve, that means that the power curve would be used for the mathematical model. our model is further supported by other groups data; group one had a function of $t=2.1114 l^{0.4393}$ group 2 had a function of $t=2.09 l^{0.4511}$ group 3 had a function of $t=2.087 l^{0.4839}$ group 4 had a function of $t=2.0291 l^{0.5076}$ and group 5 had functions of $l=6.4151 l^{0.455}$ and $l = 6.3349 l^{0.4987}$. these functions are all power functions which would support our claim. the functions also have similar numbers to our own (except for group 5 which is due to systematic error), so we can safely assume that our data is accurate. the other factors would not be included with the mathematical model because we found that there was no relationship between the other two factors and the period of a pendulum.

we donâ€™t know if systematic errors were present, but if there were, we know that they would occur because of our measuring tools. the balance and the tape measurer could have been calibrated incorrectly. the systematic errors could have been fixed by using multiple measuring devices to collect our data. the random errors could be attributed to reaction time. we could have been late or early to stop the time on the stop watch, or when releasing and catching the pendulum. another random error could be caused by fingerprints adding weight to the pendulum. the weight would only cause minor error, but the reaction time would cause more error. this could be avoided by taking multiple trials and averaging the values.

some constraints for the lab was time. sometime my group and i would need some extra time to collect data and make calculations. another constraint was measuring tools used. if we had more devices, we would have less systematic error.
