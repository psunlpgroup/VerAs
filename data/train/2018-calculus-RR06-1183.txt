discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this experiment was to answer the question “how does force relation to a systems acceleration”?

 from our experiment, we can conclude that this relationship is direct and linear. our mathematical model in graph 1.2 $f=4.1563 x + 0.0541$ shows that as force increases (x) the acceleration of the system also increases (fx).  this model confirms our prediction that an increased force will lead to an increased acceleration, and the model, and graph in graph 1.2 both support our initial claim.
group 2 in phys 2001l 004 concluded their research with a similar mathematical model of $f=4.6817 x - 0.032$. this conclusion agrees with our conclusion because it is also a linear direct relationship and the slope of their model is also like the one produced by our experiment. the exact value for the y-intercept and slope are different however, and this can be attributed to differences in system mass, or different coeffects of friction on the pulley systems. these variables differed from group to group, so the numbers will not be identical. group 3 in phys 2001l 004 model was $f=4.7231 x - 0.0124$. which is also a linear direct relationship that agrees with my group’s findings. but again, the numbers are slightly different since different apparatuses were used with different friction coefficients and different system masses. since all three of our groups agreed that the relationship between force and acceleration was a direct and linear relationship with slopes that were close to each other and only had discrepancies in the y- intercept the experiments agree with each other and do not really disagree with each other when differences in systems and friction are considered.

the theoretical model for the relationship between force and acceleration is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. this is like the model $a=c1 w +c2$ which is how the mathematical model from this experiment looks without values form the experiment. c1 is equal to 1/mass of the system and w is the force being applied by gravity. c2 is the unaccounted-for forces like the friction of the rope and air resistance. for the challenge set in l06 c2 was ignored when solving for acceleration with a new mass. this means that expression could simply be written as w/mass of system which is the same as f/m(sys) so the equations are essentially the same. this prediction is enforced because c2 in our model and the other groups listed in this report are very small and have little to no influence on the overall acceleration. 

an enhanced theoretical model was also provided which was $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. this model also resembles the mathematical model obtained in lab. since $a=c1 w +c2$ and c1 is still equal to 1/m(sys) and w is still the force of gravity on the system, c2 is the only component left to examine. c2 can be written as f(ext)/m(sys). the reason c2 is ignored in challenge problem in l06 is because the f(ext) is unknown and since the contribution of this force on the overall acceleration is so low it can be ignored, and the predicted acceleration will be within the margin of error allowed by the uncertainty.

if a heavy string was used in the experiment instead of a light one the acceleration would be slower. this is because if the mass of the string was increased then the inertia of the string was also increased. adding more inertia to the system would make the whole system more difficult to move meaning the same amount of force would move the system at a slower rate making the acceleration slower. the larger mass of the rope would also mean that gravity would pull down on the rope more leading to a larger normal force which would increase the static friction and kinetic friction that the rope on the pulley experiences ultimately slowing down the acceleration.

systematic and random errors were present in this experiment. random errors were present in the scale that was used because it may have been calibrated incorrectly, the same can be said for the hardware used to monitor acceleration. if the same system was used the system would give two different value for acceleration the difference would be small, but it was still different. systematic errors were present but were attempted to be reduced because we let the same person record the masses so that way masses were rounded by the same person and there would be no discrepancies in a person’s judgment since the same judgment was used.

the experiment was constrained by the fact that small amount of friction exists in the pulley and on the track even though they are supposed to be “frictionless” the string used also had a mass and was not massless. removing these constraints would create a better experiment but removing the constraint of mass of the rope would be impossible. removing the constraint of air resistance could be accomplished by preforming the experiment in a vacuum. these constraints do not really affect the results though because they contribute so little to the affect on acceleration.
