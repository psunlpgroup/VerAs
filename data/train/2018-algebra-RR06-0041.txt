discussion and conclusion



over the past two weeks, applied force and and acceleration of a system have been investigated. the following research question was used to design the experiment is  how does acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes. the experiment used a smaller cart with a relatively small mass and fishing bobbers that acted as weights. 

	for this experiment, it was predicted that applied force and acceleration share a positive linear relationship. after analyzing our graphical data, we can accept this prediction. a linear regression model was used to fit the data points, having an r^2 value of about .94. this value indicates that the linear model is a good fit for the data, and that the two variables tested share a linear relationship. 

	from the graph, the equation of the line was derived in $y=b + m x$ form. this equation was $y=4.6131 x - 0.4994$. comparing our findings to other groups, we found that our data obtained and linear model were similar to two other groups. the first group had the same experimental design and a similar hypothesis. their equation was $y=4.38 x + 0.002$. this equation had a different y-intercept, yet similar slope value. the y-intercept values (.4994 & .002) really just represented the amount of friction present. this value could slightly vary based on the difference in tracks and vacuum accuracy, since all groups used different tracks and vacuum systems. this group’s graphical model looked very similar to ours. the same error was used for the y-axis at .001 n. overall, this group’s data supports our claim that applied force impacts the acceleration of the system and that the two variables share a positive relationship.

	analyzing the second group’s findings, they also had a very similar linear model $y=5.189 x - 0.0297$. again, this equation had a different y-intercept, yet similar slope value. this value could slightly vary based on the difference in tracks and vacuum accuracy, since all groups used different tracks and vacuum systems. this group’s graphical model looked very similar to ours. the same error was used for the y-axis at .001 n. this group also predicted that as hanging mass (applied force) increased, acceleration increases, displaying a positive linear relationship. this group’s data supports our claim.

	when comparing our experimental mathematical model, $y=4.6131 x - 0.4994$ to the theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, our model does not account for friction and air resistance. we could not calculate this in the lab setting because our experiment was not conducted in a vacuum chamber. friction was present on the track in between the track and the cart. 

when comparing the enhanced theoretical equation, $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, to our mathematical model, $y=4.6131 x - 0.4994$ again friction and air resistance are both not accounted for. this is impossible to calculate in the lab setting. since we did not have access to a vacuum chamber. although the vacuum on the track was used, friction was still present.  

suppose a heavy string was used and attached to the cart, instead of a smaller, thin string. this heavy string would add to the total mass of the system. in the calculation of acceleration, $a=\frac{f_{net}}{m}$. total mass in this situation is equal to the hanging mass plus mass of the string. increasing the value of the denominator (total mass) will decrease acceleration, as long as fnet is kept constant. so, using a heavy string will decrease acceleration of the system. 

one potential source of error is the balance being calibrated incorrectly. this would be a source of systematic error if the balance consistently underestimated or overestimated the true mass of the objects it was weighing. another potential source of error was the system was pulled in a vacuum, meaning there should have been no friction. however, this is almost impossible to accomplish. there was most likely a small amount of friction between the cart and the track as it moved along. this was most likely a random error, depending on how much friction the cart experienced during each trial. in the paragraph below, solutions to these errors and how they can be reduced are explained. 

a few constraints within the experiment included time and equipment used. if more time was provided, more trials would have been completed. more trials allow for more precise results due to a larger sample of data. the equipment provided for the experiment was bobbers that were used as the added mass, an open vacuum and a sliding balance was used. to improve the experiment, a vacuum chamber could have been used as a better way to ensure the cart was not exposed to friction and other outside forces. another way to improve the experiment would be to use an electronic balance. this step could reduce human error present, when using a sliding balance. lastly, using bobbers as weight increments, was not ideal. the bobbers varied in mass by a fraction of a gram. this was not an issue until attempting to do the challenge round, where the mass of the system had to be extremely close to the calculated value in order to obtain correct acceleration.
