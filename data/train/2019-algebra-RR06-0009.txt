discussion and conclusion



in our experiment of what might effect on the acceleration, where we had tested the effects of changing the hanging mass and the angle of the movement, we had to part of experiments for an understanding of what could effect on the acceleration. in the first part of the experiment, it is found that the weight of the hanging mass directly effects on the acceleration. that because when the weight of the applied force increases the acceleration also increase and that appeared in the data of all eight different hanging masses. in the second part of the experiments where the angle of the track is changed by increasing the angle for three times to have in total of four different groups of data. from changing the angle of the track brighten up that the angle has a direct effect on the acceleration. the acceleration was increasing very clearly when the angle increases and that because when angle increase the cart move down where the gravity pull the cart adding some speed and the fraction decreased. other group had experimented on tasting the effect of the fraction on the acceleration, and what they had found was that the fraction had not shown a directed effect on the acceleration where the acceleration sites almost the same is without adding the fraction, but they had agreed with our group result that when the force applied increases the acceleration also increase. moreover, another group had the smiler experiment to our experiment where they had an exam the effects of changing the angle of the track on the acceleration of the system. their claim is supporting our result where their data shows that when the angle increase, the acceleration increase and when the hanging masse increase the acceleration increase as well. our equation $a=c f + c$ while newton's second law is that $a=\frac{f_{net}}{m}= \frac{f1+f2}{m}$ and if there is more f then we keep dividing it with mass. that is drive us to similar resolute of our equation where it was tested in lab 6, and the error was.0044 from the newton law. the heavier the cart the lowest is the acceleration and from the equation $f=m a$ where $a=\frac{f}{m}$ them more is the weight the less is the acceleration. that explained why the staring with heavy cart and light hanging mass has lower acceleration where the fours effect less if the mass is higher because for more large mass stronger force is needed for faster acceleration. by calculating the acceleration from the newton law and our equation there is a little different, and that is affected by the constraints that limit our research on the experiment. there is some variable that we did not test, and they could influence the acceleration, and one of them is the friction which has a negative pull on acceleration. the slabs of steel that is used to elevate the system were not perfect in width on all sides which may affect the actual tilt we have measured. lastly, the applied fours that to cause a net change on the system we do not know if it constant or does it have on its acceleration. further information is needed, and more research is misery for better understanding the effects on the acceleration.
