discussion and conclusion

the purpose of the lab is to determine the effect of the mass on the acceleration of a system, as well as determine how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. the experiment and the resulting mathematical model address the research question because when looking at graph 1, the mathematical model is $y=4.3 x + 0.1$. this model determines the average acceleration, 4.30 m/2s^s and the applied force can be determined from this. the error bars are very small and cannot be seen in the graph, which shows that there is a low amount of error or difference in the lab. the two groups, monkeys and squrt both support my own group’s claim that there is a relationship between the amount of force applied to and the acceleration of the system. there is a difference in the acceleration of both groups, as the monkeys had an acceleration of 0.0043 while the squrt had an acceleration of 4.346. this difference could have been because of miscalculated conversions. both groups had a similar hypothesis, controls, and graphs. the experimental and theoretical models compare well, as the applied force has an effect of the mass of a system. the theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ is related to $a=c1 w+c2$ because with acceleration, it can be substituted into the other equations. results from the curve fitting show the mathematical model equation, and this fits in with the fitting parameters because the acceleration was found to be 4.30 m /2s^s. the advanced theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ is related to the experimental mathematical model because the slope from the graph is acceleration and m is mass of the system. the extra forces relate to the fitting parameters because the extra force is accounting for the bobbers on both the cart and hanging from the system. other forces besides the hanging weight that may be present in the experimental contest are the force of gravity and the force of the student pushing the system. the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model because it is the $f=m a$ and the mass of the system is the m in the equation. also, the slope is acceleration so slope times the mass of the system is the force. a non-massless strong connecting to the hanging mass to the cart might affect the uniform acceleration of the cart because it would have a positive increase on the acceleration of the system. this is because as the cart moves further, there is more string and thus more weight. errors such as air resistance, level of the air track, scale differences, faulty vacuum or other equipment, and friction would be systematic because an error could occur inaccurately for these differences in equipment and other factors. the weight of bobbers, uncertainty from data studio, and point of release differences are random errors because this is likely caused by human error with point of release and selecting values in data studio or the bobbers could all weigh different amounts. some constraints in this experiment that may limit the generalizability may be different machines or other equipment that may work differently. also, the student running the experiment could have performed the experiment differently or have various weight differences.
