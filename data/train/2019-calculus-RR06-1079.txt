	in this lab, the question of “will increasing the hanging mass versus decreasing the mass on the cart impact the acceleration of the system?” was investigated. also, a second question, “will increasing the tilt of the track while also increasing the hanging mass impact the acceleration?” was studied as well.

	in order to make a conclusion, the hanging mass of the pulley system was declared the independent variable. weights were taken from the cart and added to the string in increments of one bobber per run of the air track. each bobber was around 4.6 or 4.7 grams in weight. after going through several trials of increasing the weight on the string while keeping the mass of the system constant, it was found that increasing the weight on the string did increase the acceleration of the system. as viewed in graph 1, the data is linearly related, with an increase in weight leading to an increase in acceleration. the equation of the line in graph 1 is $y=38.164 x - 7.215$ with r² is 0.9563. the error bars are too small to be seen. when compared to another group’s data, their conclusion matched the one that was found with this set of data. both trendlines were linear, with the other group’s trendline being $y=0.031 x + 0.149$ and r^2 is .9599. when consulting a third group, their findings were also similar to that of our own and the first other group. their data model was a linear line with $y=0.0024 x - 0.029$ and r^2 is 0.9885. 

	the theoretical model of the equation studied is $a = \frac{f}{m}$. the data recorded in this lab, the experimental model, does support the equation. since the masses used were so small (around 4.7 grams, or .0047 kg) and measured in kg, by dividing by a decimal the constant/slope of the graph became larger, such as 38.164 in our case.

	the enhanced theoretical model is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. the data from this lab supports this model because the track was nearly frictionless, but not all the way. this is accounted for in the equation because the y intercept is not zero. the force of friction still acts upon the cart and the string and pulley. if the linear model found was an exact match of the equation $a = \frac{f}{m}$, there would not be a y intercept.

	if the string had been heavy, the resultant acceleration would have been slower, as the mass of the string would have to be accounted for in the equation $a =\frac{f}{m}$ . as the mass increases, the force would have to increase as well to match the same acceleration, which is not what was observed.

	a few sources of error were identified in this lab. one of which was that the masses were measured with a triple beam balance, so their exact masses were estimated. another source of error was that the track and pulley were not completely frictionless. while they appeared to be frictionless, they were not, adding to the external forces modeled by the enhanced theoretical equation and supported by the data model. one other source of error was that during testing, occasionally the cart would accelerate too fast and bobbers would fly off, or the string would fall out of the groove of the pulley, leading to skewed results.

	some constraints in this experiment were that the track was not completely frictionless and the pulley was not as well. the amount of bobbers and the length of the string were also constraints as the weight was limited to 8 bobbers weighing around 40 grams and a string length of 50 cm.
