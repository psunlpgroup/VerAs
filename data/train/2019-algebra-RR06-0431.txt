conclusion:
 to create mathematical models to our experiments and from that further experiment on the specific numerical values of our mathematical equations to help us understand what they represented. 

in our first two experiments in lab 5 we were looking for how the applied force changed the acceleration and how the mass of the car changed acceleration. in the first test we found that the more applied force you put on the cart the faster the cart would accelerate as shown in graph 1. we also found that the more mass you put on the cart the slower the acceleration became as shown in graph 2. for the last experiment in lab 6 we were testing the how friction affected the acceleration and we found that the more friction we added or in our case the more magnets we added the slower our acceleration became as shown in graphs 3-5. after looking at all the graphs and data we found out that the number in front of the x was just 1/our total resting mass + the unknown force/ total resting force.  
for group 1 they did the tilting of the system and they got their equations to be $y=2.9402 x-0.068$, $y=2.951 x-0.1141$,  $y=2.9423 x-0.136$.  we also got data from group 2 who did the same tilt testing and they got $y=2.8446 x+0.0818$, $y=2.8443 x+0.0929$, $y=2.8312 x+0.1046$. with both of these data equations we were able to understand that when they added more slope to their testing the acceleration became smaller showing that when the system got put to the max tilt the numbers after the x-values become larger as shown in the above mathematical models. 

some random errors might be the line in some experiments were knotted creating a bump that the technology used to measure acceleration could take as an increase in acceleration creating a larger set of acceleration. some systematic errors might be miss measuring the bobbers causing a sway in the results.

we couldn’t use a really heavy weight like 1000kg vs. .00001 kg to get a full range of data also we were restrained on time so we couldn’t get as many trials done as we should to get a complete set of data. 

our models are consistent with newtons second law because if you rearrange the equation and solve for a you get $a=\frac{e_f}{m}$ and the f we have are fa and f unknown so $a=f_a+\frac{f_{unknown}}{m_{resting}}$ as shown here the fa is x and mresting and funknown are values so we get an equation that looks like $a=b f_a + b$
