the research question is how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? the evidence obtained supports the claim through it failing the horizontal line test. which simply means that not one single horizontal line can be drawn and hit all the point on the graph. which shows that acceleration of a system does change when the applied force changes, which then gives us a linear relationship. the failure of the horizontal line test also applies to the error bars because due to their sizes and being too small to be seen on the graph, not one horizontal line can be drawn that hits all the error bars in the positive or negative direction. the findings of group #4 support our group’s results and conclusions because their graph is also linear which is like our and shows that their graph also fails the horizontal line test, which matches our prediction and theirs. the findings of group #2 support our group’s results and conclusions because their data is very similar to ours. it also supports our results because their accelerations are not all around the same value and steadily increase which supports the linear relationship we achieved with my group’s data and group #4’s data. the theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ supports the mathematical model, $a=c1 w+c2$, because the mathematical model shows the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable which is shown in the numerator which is the independent variable and the a variable which would be the y, in a simple math formula very commonly known as $y=m x+ b$, represents the dependent variable. the enhanced theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ supports the mathematical model, $a=c1 w+c2$, because the first part of the enhanced theoretical equation relates to the c1 in the mathematical model and the second half of the enhanced theoretical equation relates to c2. the extra force relates to the fitting parameters because the force exerted is so small that it barely affects the results. especially when the force exerted is already small and gets divided by .1863 kg which makes it so small that it is so close to zero that it has no effect on the results. the major constraint was that the track had to completely level. another constraint was that the string connecting the cart with the balls had to massless string. another constraint is that the pump is at max rpm to increase airflow and decrease friction. a potential systematic error could be that the pump is not at max rpm which increases airflow and decreases friction. a potential random error could that the track is not completely level. a way to fix that random error could be to use a leveler, and make sure that the track is completely level.
