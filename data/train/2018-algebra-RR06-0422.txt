the purpose of this lab was to investigate the research question of: how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? in this experiment the hanging weight was used to calculate the applied force on the cart because it, along with gravity, was the force pulling the cart along the track. the investigation found that as the force was increased, the acceleration of the cart also increased in a linear relationship as show in figure 1. 

the data of group 4 supports our claim as their experiment also found a linear relationship between the applied force and acceleration. their experimental mathematical model was similar to that of our group which will be discussed shortly.
the data of group 2 also supports our claim as their experiment found a linear relationship between the applied force and acceleration as well. their experimental mathematical model was similar to that of our group which will be discussed shortly.
the theoretical model for the acceleration of a system by a single force is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. our experimental mathematical model of $y=5.36 x - 0.0436$ supports the theoretical model because 1/msys was 5.59. in the equation, the value of 5.36, which is relatively close to 5.59, is the mathematical model value for 1/msys. 1/msys multiplied by the force applied to the system yields the acceleration thus, 1/msys is the slope of the fit line shown in figure 1. our experimental mathematical model, however, has a y-intercept. this indicates another force, possibly friction or air resistance played a role in experiment. this also indicates a need for more enhanced theoretical model. the enhanced theoretical model for the acceleration of the system under two forces is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}Â +\frac{f_k}{m_{sys}}$ where fk is equal to the force of friction. our experimental mathematical model also supports this enhanced model because along with 1/msys being relatively close to 5.36, this enhanced theoretical model also takes into account the y-intercept of our experimental mathematical model. this y-intercept is equal to fk/msys and given this value and the mass our system, it could be determined that the frictional force acting on the cart was .007787n in the opposite direction of acceleration.
in a scenario in which the string connecting the hanging mass to the cart had an appreciable mass, acceleration of the system would not be uniform because as the hanging mass moves toward the ground there is more string being acted on by gravity, therefore, the force being applied to the system is not constant thus neither is the acceleration.
random errors in this experiment include but are not limited to slightly incorrect measurements of mass the system, not releasing the cart from the same distance to the end of the track every single trial, and possible applying a force to the cart as it is released from rest. these random errors were reduced by taking multiple trials and using careful techniques when setting up the system and measuring the mass of the system. systematic errors in the experiment include the precision of the scale and of the acceleration detector. these errors are unavoidable as they are inherent in experimental equipment. constraints on this experiment include that it was conducted in a controlled laboratory and that friction was significantly reduced on the track. these affect the generalizability as these frictionless and controlled conditions are typically not found in the real world.
