discussion & conclusion:

	the purpose of these experiments was to determine the impacts on a period of a pendulum for small swings. 

    the first experiment proved that the angle of release does not directly affect the length of the period, and therefore the prediction was wrong. for each trial, the angle was increased but the time it took for one swing did not change. this was determined by evaluating the data in data table 1 and especially the graph in figure 1 which had nearly no slope at all, indicating there was barely a change between each angle of release. it can be concluded the 2 variables (length of the period being dependent & angle of release being independent) had no relationship between each other.

    the second experiment proved that the mass of the weight does not directly affect the length of the period either, and therefore this prediction was wrong as well. for each trial, the mass of the weight was increased but the time for one swing did not change again. this was again determined by looking at the data in data table 2 and the graph in figure 2. the graph had nearly no slope as the weight was nearly quadrupled, which again indicated there was barely a change between each increase of the mass. it can be concluded the 2 variables (length of period again being dependent & mass of weight being independent) had no relationship between each other as well.

    the third experiment proved that the length of the string does directly affect the length of the period and the prediction was correct. for each trial, the length of the string was increased and the time was too. the shorter the string was, the less time it took for the pendulum to complete one period or full swing. this was proved through the data in data table 3 and the graph in figure 3. there is an obvious positive slope concluding there is a relationship between the 2 variables is  the length of the string (independent) and the length of the period (dependent); as one increased, so did the other. the relationship is nonlinear, or a power relationship.

    the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. 

the constant, in cm/s^2, 2π/√(g) is equal to 0.2007 cm/s^2. the constant in my group’s equation equals 0.1997 cm/s^1 (from week 3). this was determined by repeating experiment 3 with 6 various lengths of string (36 cm-170.6 cm). this data was graphed, was nonlinear & gave us the value of $y= 0.1997 x^{0.5008}$ or $y= 0.1997 x^{1}$. this shows that the model we discovered is like that of the accepted mathematical equation. the curve, or slope, is positive when a line of best fit is drawn for it for the graph in figure 3 unlike the lack of slope in figures 1 & 2.

    the errors present included one more systemic than random. one systemic error was the speed of the stopwatch. the only way this could be improved was by using a different stopwatch in hopes that it worked properly. another systemic error was the mass of the weights were heavier than what they said. the only way this could be improved would be by weighing the weights on a scale before testing them for the experiment. a random error included not starting & stopping the stopwatch right when it needed to. this was improved or fixed by simply being more precise and watching the pendulum carefully to know when to start & stop. the systemic error (the stopwatch) contributed mainly to all measurement uncertainties.

    constraints for this experiment include wind resistance. although wind resistance wasn’t considered during these experiments, it can impact the results. the resistance eventually causes the pendulum to slow down over time and come to a stop. that is why we only tested one single period, or swing, where air resistance is minimum & isn’t as affective to the results as multiple swings later would be.
