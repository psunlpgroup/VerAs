conclusion:

	this experiment was conducted to see how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force (mass of hanging bobs) changes. to answer this question the acceleration of the cart was considered the dependent variable, the mass of the hanging bobs was the independent variable, and the mass of the whole system (one cart plus eight bobs) was the control variable. since the mass of the system was a control, the same cart and the same eight bobs were used in the experiment. any bobs that were not attached to the end of the string, as the hanging weight, were attached to the cart to keep the mass of the system constant. the same procedure was followed throughout the experiment except each time one bob would be added to the hanging mass until all eight acceleration were collected (data found in table 2). to reduce friction, the cart was placed on a tract that would push air under the cart the make it hover over the track when the air was turned on. this allowed the cart to move without too many outside forces acting on it, which meant that any movement of the cart was most likely due to the mass of the hanging bobs. the experiment was started by attaching one bob to the end of the string (which is attached to the cart) and measuring the acceleration of the cart on the ‘frictionless’ track. the accelerations of the cart were derived from the data studio program. the data studio program would measure and record the velocity of the cart, the acceleration of the cart is obtained from the slope of the line of best fit of the velocity versus time graph. 

	once the data was collected, the mass of the hanging bobs was plotted against the acceleration of the cart (as seen in figure 1). the uncertainty for the mass was determined to be 0.05 g because the smallest unit the scale measures to is 0.1 g, and the find the uncertainty, the smallest unit of the scale should be divided in half. the horizontal error bars on figure 1 are the uncertainty of the weighing scale (0.05 g), this is one sigma. the one sigma error bars are very small, beardly visible. to check the significance of the data (the equivalency criterion) the sigma must be doubled. however, in this case even if the sigma was doubles, a straight line cannot be drawn thought all (or most) of the points. this indicates that each data point is significant, and the equivalency criterion supports the data found from this experiment. the acceleration is obtained from the slope of the velocity versus hanging mass graph, which means that the accelerations recorded are not completely correct (not the true value). the vertical error bars on figure 1 represent the uncertainties of the accelerations in one sigma. the equivalency criterion can be used to double check the data, if the vertical error bars were doubled from one sigma to two sigma there still would not be much overlap since the uncertainties are so small. this means that all of the data points are significant. based on the fact that the data points are unique, the trend shows that as the hanging mass increases the acceleration also increases. the line of best fit follows a linear fashion, the equation of the line is $y=0.0499 x - 0.0106$.

	next, the obtained acceleration values and the masses of the system were used to find the force. $f=m a$ is the formulas used to calculates the force. once the forces were calculated, they were graphed against accelerations of the cart (as seen in figure 2). the line of best fit for this graph, which was $y = 0.0053 x - 6e^{-06}$, is that experimental mathematical model (in the correct units $y = 5.34 x-6e^{-3}$. the experimental c1 value was 5.34kg-1, and the external force is 0.0011n. since $c1 =\frac{1}{m_{sys}}$ and $f_{ext} = \frac{c2 x}{c1}$, the theoretical value of c1 in this experiment is 5.34kg-1 and the fext was 0.0011n. 

	when comparing the results of this experiment to those of 3g1b’s experiment results, it can be seen that both experiment had different experimental model (since both experiments used different carts and bobs, so they had a different control value). 3g1b had the same theoretical c1 value of 5.34 but they got a different experimental value for c1, being 4.6961 where ours was 5.34.  this shows that they had more error in their experiment than we did, but it is still relatively similar to our value. the other group who’s data was compared to this data were called the dusty pigeons, they have slightly smaller values for c1, the experimental c1 was 5.1023, and the theoretical c1 is 5.2949. both groups having different c1 values for the experimental and the theoretical might indicate that they had more error in their experiment. this experiment also resulted in the smallest external force values (0.0011n) compared to the other two groups, which could mean there were less external forces acting on this experiment compared to others. 

	the theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ was used to calculate the force acting on the system as mentioned earlier. the mass of the system remained constant and the accelerations were obtained from the data. the equation can be rearranged to be easier by $f = m a$. the experimental model is $a = c1 w+c2$. there can be many external forces that are acting upon our system such as air resistance and friction. these forces will show up in the experimental model in the value of c2.  $c2=\frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. because we know the mass of the system, we can figure out the value of the external forces acting on our system. the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model as part of the value of c1.  $c1=m_{sys}^{-1}$. enhanced theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. this enhanced theoretical equation allows the data in this lab to be compared to those of other people. this equation can also be used to see if other forces are acting on the system, apart from the hanging bobs (the independent variable). if this were to happen, the experiment would have to be redone because the data would not be able to associate the changes in the acceleration of the cart with the change in the hanging mass. the results of this experiment support the theoretical model, since it was the same as the experimental model.

	if a heavy string was used in place of the light string, two things could happen. this could affect the acceleration of the cart, or it could have no effect on the acceleration of the cart. the heavy string could potentially have no effect since it would be accounted for when weighing the mass of a system, so the systems mass is conserved. however, the reason the heavy string could affect the acceleration of the cart is because the hanging weight might keep changing instead of staying still. as the bobs would pull the cart closer to the edge, the more string that is released, the more the weight would increase. another possible outcome of using heavy string would be the slowing down of the acceleration of the cart, it might take a larger mass of hanging bobs to pull the cart to one line or the edge. overall, a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart would not have an influence on the uniform acceleration of the cart. when looking at the theoretical math equation, you do weigh the string along with the cart but if it is a frictionless track and wheel, then the mass of the string would not have a big significance on the acceleration

	since the results of this experiment showed that both the experimental and theoretical model had the same c1 and fext values, this indicates that there was a very little room for error. measuring and obtaining the acceleration data could have led to error. since the acceleration is measured by taking the slope of the velocity vs. time graph, there could be randomness or inexact readings of the measurements. this would be an example of random error which could be fixed with taking the average of a lot of data, which is exactly how the acceleration of the carts were derive.  there were not many opportunities for a systematic error to occur unless the researchers in this experiment did not zero the weighting scales and all of the masses they collected are skewed. this problem could be corrected if the scale was properly zero, and the measurements were converted to the correctoner. 

	the generalizability of these results is constrained because the results of this experiment were dependent on the mass of the system and the mass of the hanging bob(s). these masses can vary from experiment to experiment as seen in the results of the other groups, and this variation will lead to different results. this makes our results specific to our masses and less general.
