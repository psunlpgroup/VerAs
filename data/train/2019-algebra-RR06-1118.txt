discussion and conclusion

the purpose of lab 05: force and motion part i, was to examine the relationship between acceleration (iv) and force applied (dv) in model 1, and between acceleration (iv) and the mass of the system (dv) in model 2, and to use those relationships to develop a mathematical model that will describe the behavior of that system.
the purpose of lab 06 is  force and motion part ii, was to analyze the mathematical model from lab 05 model 1 and develop and understanding of how each variable and numerical value (the y-intercept, for example) relate to the physical experiment being conducted in the lab and to analyze the physical factors that can affect the mathematical modeling of the situation.
the first experiment of lab 05 (model 1) we set up a cart on an air track and measured the acceleration of the cart with a varying applied force. we held the mass of the system constant by starting with four bobs on the cart (dv) and four hanging as the hanging mass (iv) and for each successive trial we removed one bob form the cart and added it to the hanging mass, this is what kept the mass of the system constant (cv). after all trials had been completed and the data compiled, we used the data table we had generated in excel to create a graph of the data and applied a trend line to model the data and determined that the relationship was linear and the equation of that trend line was, $a=2.8555 f - 0.0205$ where the variable “a” is the acceleration of the cart, and the variable “f” is the force applied to the system. we know that $f_{net} = m a$, and the equation be written to give acceleration as, $a = \frac{f_{net}}{m}$ to writing this equation in the form $y = m x + b$ you have write is as, $a = (m-1) f_{net}$, so in our equation “a” is the acceleration, 2.855 is m-1 and “f” is the force applied by the hanging mass in the system.
the second experiment of lab 05 (model 2) we used the same cart and air track except this time the hanging mass was held constant (cv) and we changed the mass of the system (iv) by adding weights to the top of the cart and measured the acceleration. again, the data was recorded in an excel spreadsheet from which a graph was produced and a trendline added to give and equation in the form of a power curve, $a = 0.266 m-1.391$, were “a” is acceleration and “m” is the mass of the system, 0.266 represents the theoretical applied force, and the exponent -1.391 is supposed to represent -1 which is the power that the mass “m” is raised to form the equation $a = f_{net} m^{-1}$, the numbers are within and acceptable range to model the data.
the experiment in lab 06 was intended to find the meaning behind the y-intercept value in the mathematical model form lab 05, model 1. it was determined that the value of the y-intercept was affected by the placement of the magnetic bars on the cart. we discovered this by repeating the process described in the first experiment (lab 05, model 1) except that the experiment was repeated three times, each time changing the placement of the magnetic bars, which yielded a different equation for each series of trials.
the photo on the right is display of the mathematical models developed by group 1 for the experiment conducted in lab 06. group 1 investigated the impact of the inclination of the air track on the values of the equation. the findings of this group support our claim that physical factors in the lab such as the incline of the air track can impact the mathematical models created by our experiments. the evidence is shown in their equations where they have three different equations for three different physical factors of the experiment, just as we do for three different positions of the magnetic bars on our cart. 

during the experiment we may have experienced random errors while measuring the mass of the bobs, cart, and magnetic bars due to the uncertainty of the scale itself. these small errors in measurement can affect the results of the experience by not truly representing the mass which will affect the calculation of the force applied to the system as well as the mass of the system.
 while i believe that there were no systematic errors present in our experiment, there could have been a possibility of systematic error while using the data studio equipment for measure the acceleration of the cart, or if the scale was not properly zeroed which would cause all of our measured mass values to be either higher or lower than expected because systematic errors are always one-sided errors.

	
	while the friction associated with the air track is negligible, it is not frictionless, therefore there will be slight deviation from newton’s second law which is true in the absence of friction. also, as stated in 5.c. there are physical factors in the lab environment that can limit the generalizability of our results.
newton’s second law states that $f_{net} = m_{system} a$. in first experiment of lab 05 we investigated the impact of changing the applied force (fnet) had on the acceleration of the cart, while the mass of the system remained constant. by newton’s second law you can rearrange the equation to $a = \frac{f_{net}}{m}$, our model for this portion of the experiment is $a = 2.8555 f - 0.0205$

	where 2.855 is m-1, “f” is fnet and -0.0205 is a value added to the equation due to the physical placement of the mass on the cart. these values are within the acceptable range to be consistent with newton’s second law.

	for the second experiment in lab 05 we investigated the impact that the mass of the system has on the acceleration of the cart when the force applied is held constant. which represented by newton’s second law is also $a = f_{net} m^{-1}$, our experiment yielded the equation $a = 0.266 m^{-1.391}$ where in this case 0.266 is the model force applied and -1.391 is representing m-1, because multiplying by m-1 is the same as dividing by m. our values were deemed within the acceptable range to be consistent with newton’s second law.
