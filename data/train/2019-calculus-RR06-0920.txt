discussion and conclusion.

 	 the purpose of labs 5 and 6 was to investigate the behavior of a system with an applied force and resting mass, develop mathematical models that describe the system and finally to develop an understanding of what each variable and value in the mathematical models means. 

	the mathematical models were obtained by plotting the independent variable against acceleration and using the best fit line feature in excel. for the model of applied force vs acceleration, the slope is the inverse of the system mass and the y intercept is some unknown resistive force. for the model of system mass vs acceleration, the coefficient is the applied force, x is the resting mass and the exponent is -1 because the acceleration is force divided by mass. when investigating how incline affects the model, it was found that the y intercept of the applied force vs acceleration increased in magnitude as the incline increased. when the height of the incline was 3.00mm, the intercept was only 0.0038 and it increased to 0.0382 when the height was 6.48mm and increased further to 0.0608 when the height was 9.52mm. 




the above pictures summarize the findings of two other groups. group 2 was investigating the same factor as our group, how incline affects the model, while group 4 was investigating how friction changed the model. group 2’s data is very similar to our own, with the main difference that their setup created a negative slope of the track, whereas ours created a positive slope. this explains the difference in signs of the y intercept in the models; going down an incline causes more acceleration than traveling up an incline. group 4’s models also match expectations. adding friction via magnets increases the magnitude of the y intercept as would be expected. also accounted for in their models is the increase in system mass, seen as the decrease in the slope of the model as the mass increases. 

the main type of error that could have been present is systematic error and comes from the sensor used to measure acceleration. the listed precision of the sensor is ±0.001, however it is possible the sensor was not calibrated and thus might be a source of systematic error. for example, if the sensor read an acceleration of 1 m/s2 as 1.5m/s2, all of the values recorded would be skewed higher than they actually are, resulting in the models being off. another source of systematic error could be if the track wasn’t level to begin with. depending on the direction it was tilted, it would skew the resistive force one way or another. the best way to reduce systematic error caused by the sensor would be to use the same set of bobbers and different sensors to expose any differences in the sensors. to minimize error caused by the track, a level could be used to ensure it is not inclined one way or another at the start of the experiment.

constraints of the experiment include a limited amount of weights to test with, a limited set of different test heights that can be used, and a number of factors that weren’t or couldn’t be tested such as gravitational acceleration, air resistance, string mass, and friction on an inclined track. all of these factors limit the generalizability of the results because a general model must be able to account for all factors under all conditions, whereas our models only cover a small set of conditions. as an example, the increase in the resistive force caused by the incline appeared to be linear but with only three data points it is impossible to create a generalized model of how the variable changes as a function of incline height. 

the two mathematical models are consistent with the theoretical models as they have the same form. for the first model, the equation is $a = m x + b$, where a is acceleration, m is the inverse of the system mass, x is the applied force, and b is the resisting force divided by the system mass. this makes sense because the net force equation would be $f_{net} = f_{applied}-f_{resistance}$, which simplifies to $a = \frac{f_{applied}}{m} – \frac{f_{res}}{m}$. the second model is of the form $y = m b$, where m is the net force, x is the system mass, and b is -1. this makes sense because for the second equation, $f_{net} = m a$, f net would be the constant force applied minus the constant resistive force, m would be the system mass, and it would be in the denominator, thus the exponent is -1.
