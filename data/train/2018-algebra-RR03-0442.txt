discussion/conclusion

	the data that was collected proved that the period of the pendulum was affected by the angle in which the pendulum was dropped and the length of the string. figure one and figure three show how the dependent variable is noticeably affected by the independent variable. you can see the error bars overlapping heavily meaning that a relationship can be seen with each tested variable. in one of the trials where the mass was tested, there was only a slight variation which could lead someone to believe that mass might have some sort of effect on the period, but the difference is not big enough to prove any relationship. the error bars are not overlapping much meaning that there is not much of a difference in each trial for that specific experiment. the difference could have been caused by a random error of one of the researchers conducting the experiment. it could be possible that the string might not have been measured right or the angle in which the pendulum was dropped might not have been exact. the length of the string was proven to have an effect because the numbers changed drastically with the different lengths in string. the angle of the pendulum only caused slight changes in the period. this experiment would need more trials so that it can rule out the chance that the difference in the values for the period were not just due to random error. the random errors could have been a mismeasurement of the string or a lack of precision as far as releasing the pendulum at an exact angle or even the timer not being started at the correct time. these random errors could be fixed by the researchers paying a little closer attention to the experiment or having one person for each variable so that the odds of that person recreating the same variable is higher than having a different person recreate that same variable. when the length was tested, researchers found that the relationship between the length of string and the time was not linear. the power trend is supposed to follow the model of $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$). the researcherâ€™s equation of the line was $y = 0.2717 x^{0.4424}$ compared to the actual equation of $y = 0.2007 x^{0.5}$. the difference in the values can probably be attributed to the random errors that might have occurred during the experiment.
