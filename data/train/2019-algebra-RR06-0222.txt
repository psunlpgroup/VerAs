discussion and conclusion

restate the research question: the research question of these two labs was “is the applied force caused by the hanging mass, the mass of the cart, or the tilt of the track related to the acceleration of a cart?”

experiments with hanging weight as iv is  our data from lab 5 supports the hypothesis that the applied force caused by the hanging weight is related to the acceleration of the system. figure 1 shows that these two variables show a positive correlation and this data can be considered significant because the r^2 value equals .9999 which is very close to 1. furthermore, the correlation can be considered significant because the error bars are very small.
the data found by groups 3 and 4 supports our conclusion that the applied force caused by the hanging mass exhibits a positive correlation with the acceleration of the cart. like our data, their mathematical model shows a linear relationship between the two variables and their data can be trusted because the r^2 value for the data is also very close to 1. 
the data by group 2 supports our conclusion that the tilt of the track exhibits a negative correlation with the acceleration of the system. this is shown through the fact that equation 1 has a greater value for c1 than equation 3 which shows that the acceleration is decreasing since c1 represents the acceleration of the system. 
the resting mass replaces force in the equation since the mass of the cart was shown to impact the acceleration of the system. the two forces in the sum are the applied force caused by the hanging mass and the unknown force responsible for air resistance and friction. in figure 1, our equation was calculated to be $y=2.9598 x - 0.0174$
figure 2 gives the equation $y=0.291 x^{1.135}$. the first coefficient 0.291 is the applied force caused by the hanging mass which is kept constant in the second experiment. the exponent 1.135 is the resting mass, or the mass of the cart. 
$a =  \frac{f}{m}$(
$a= \frac{f_{applied}}{m} -\frac{f_{unknown}}{m}$ 

c2 represents the sum of the unknown forces that impact the acceleration of the system, such as the tilt of the system and friction, divided by the mass. the value of c2 compared to the applied force is significantly smaller.
since a heavier string would result in a stronger applied force, then the acceleration of the system would increase as a result of having a heavier string. this is supported by the data found in the first experiment since we found that the applied force caused by the hanging mass exhibits a positive correlation with the acceleration of the system.
other factors that might impact the research question are the presence of wind resistance and friction. although friction was examined by other groups during lab 6, our group did not have a chance to look at their data because time ran out. another research question that could be asked would be “how does wind resistance affect the acceleration of the cart?” this could be investigated by controlling the variables of the mass of the cart, the hanging mass, and the friction of the surface. the experimental variable could be created by using a fan with varying degrees of intensity to see how acceleration is affected by air resistance.
one improvement would be to conduct multiple trials in order to minimize random error. furthermore, it would be easier to see a difference based on the tilt of the track if the magnitudes of the masses for each trial differed more. for example, instead of adding one bob to the resting mass from the hanging mass, two could be added to the resting mass in order to ensure a larger difference between the trials and a more significant correlation would be observed as a result.
