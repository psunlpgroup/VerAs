conclusion:

	the purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the change in applied force due to hanging mass affects the acceleration. the hypothesis was applied force does have an impact on the acceleration. according to figure 1, applied force and the acceleration have a linear relationship as predicted. as the hanging mass on the system was increased, the applied force increased, as a result, acceleration also increased when the mass of the whole system was kept constant. it has a r^2 value of 0.9827, which is very close to one. this suggests that applied force and acceleration have a strong positive correlation. for the graph applied force versus period, error bars are barely visible with the uncertainty of +/- 0.014. this further shows that the experimental quantities are within the ranges of uncertainty.

group odo conducted a same experiment as us in which their independent variable was force due to hanging mass and their dependent variable was the acceleration where they kept the mass of the system constant. they ran eight trials and their mathematical model is $y=5.2076 x + 0.092$ with the r^2 value of 0.9951. their y-intercept is bigger than ours which shows that friction and air resistance had more affect on theirs but the model itself is like ours in which the y - intercept is not equal to zero due to external forces. another group that performed the same experiment where the iv, dv, c is same as ours is dax. their theoretical model is $y=4.0987 x + 0.047$ with a r^2 value of 0.9826. our mathematical model closely resembled theirs with similar y-intercept and the r^2 value. both groups’ finding help support my conclusion and result that force due to hanging mass does affect the acceleration because the graphs from each group showed linear, positive relationship. 

mathematical models are used to establish relationships between variables. the mathematical model from our experiment gave the equation $y=4.36 x + 0.059$ and the theoretical equation obtained from rearranging the formula $f=m a$ (m is mass of the system). the experimental equation obtained from the mathematical model is $a=\frac{x}{m} + b$ (where x is the applied force and b is the y-intercept). when comparing our model to the theoretical model, our model has an initial value that is not equal to zero. it could be due to many factors like friction on the pulley, air resistance on hanging masses, and air resistance on cart as it moves, and the external force of the air on the car. other than that, our model was close to the theoretical model. though the enhanced theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ would be a better representation of our experimental model because it included the external forces which would probably make sense why our graph did not start from zero. from our mathematical model, if there is no hanging weight/ applied force, the cart will still accelerate due to the external forces. so, the enhanced theoretical model would be a better representation of our data.  

for example, if there is a heavy string connecting the mass with, the mass of the string is appreciable, the acceleration of the system will no longer be uniform. as the cart move, there is more and more string to account for, thus the mass is constant throughout the trial, which means the force acting on the system is constantly increasing. since acceleration and force are directly proportional, if the force is constantly increasing, the acceleration will be constantly increasing and no longer be uniform. 

possible systematic errors include the scale used to measure to bobbers could not have been calibrated correctly and the external force of the air track of the cart, causing some acceleration on the cart. the systematic error can be minimized by eliminating that external force that is causing the cart to accelerate without any applied force. some random error includes is  the mass of different bobbers wasn’t same. we could have weighed each separately and used the average for the mass of each. the result obtained from this experiment cannot be generalized because throughout the experiment we have not considered the force of friction. even though it was treated as frictionless, it was present in the cart’s wheels and along the surface of the track. another force that was excluded was air resistance. because of air resistance, the cart still accelerated with no hanging mass. nevertheless, we were able to show that hanging mass (force) does have an impact on the acceleration.
