conclusions

	what impacts the period of a pendulum swing? the three tests of mass, length, and angle were done to determine if any of them had an affect on the period of a pendulum swing, each one kept the other two at constants as to not affect the results of each consistent and reliable. mass was determined to have no correlation and was ruled out quickly correctly affirming the prediction that it had no affect on the period of a pendulum swing. the other two factors of string length and angle of release both were shown to have strong linear correlations even with the error bars showing that both affected the period of a pendulum swing because both graphs are positive and linear our prediction was correct that both increased period length as they individually were increased. both graphs that were shown to have strong correlations have equations on them which can be used to relatively accurately predict the period of the pendulum swing when the other variable is kept constant. most errors were random error caused by human measurement variations between tests these both could either increase or decrease the length of the period depending on if they were over or under valued. these random errors can be reduced by increasing the precision of measurement tools while running more tests for more data points ultimately making the randomness balance out. other factors such as string thickness could not be tested because of the material constraints of the lab. there are not a lot of data points which limit the generalizability of the lab towards the real world, in order to increase the generalizability the experiment would just need to have more data to extrapolate from.
