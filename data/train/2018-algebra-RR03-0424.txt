discussion and conclusion

in this lab, the research question that was explored was: what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? each of the three experiments conducted over the past three weeks have helped address this research question. our group finally arrived to the claim that the length of the pendulum affects the period of the small swings of a pendulum. 

the mass of the pendulum and its angle of release did not affect the period of the pendulum. for both of these variables, this claim was made apparent throughout the entire tested range because the slope of the period vs. mass and period vs. angle graphs were very close to zero, demonstrating that the independent variable does not impact the dependent variable for these variables. the error bars for each point on these two graphs overlapped with one another, the best fit line passed through these error bars, and the equivalency criterion of 0.113 was met, indicating that the mass and the angle for release do not affect the period of the pendulum for small swings. 

based on the period vs. length of pendulum graph, there is a relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable because the data points fit well within the trendline, which has a positive (upward) slope of 0.0104 and an r2 value of 0.9572. for our specific graph, the linear trendline does indeed cross through each error bar and the equivalency criterion of 0.113 was not met, indicating that the independent variable does impact the dependent variable and a linear relationship may be true. additionally, the error bars do not overlap between different data points on the graph (figure 2), indicating that each data point is distinct from the other.

however, our group found that the relationship between the dv and the iv is not linear in the period of pendulum vs. length of pendulum graph, which is different from what we determined in earlier lab classes. the relationship between the dv and iv depicted in the graph is best described by       $y=\sqrt{x}$         whereas we formerly concluded that the relationship was linear.



the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is      $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$            where t is the period of the pendulum in seconds, l is the length of the string in meters, and g is 9.8 m/s2. when rearranging this data so that it matches the      $y=\sqrt{x}$         formula for our graph, the mathematical model becomes is   $t=2.01 l^{0.5}$       the equation for the trendline that represents our data is       $t=1.9679 x^{0.5432}$       which is very close to the mathematical model because 1.9679 rounds to 2 and 0.5432 rounds to 0.5. therefore, the mathematical model produced from our lab data supports the theoretical model.

random errors in this lab include not aligning the protractor exactly at 180 when setting up the pendulum and inconsistency in starting and stopping the stopwatch in each trial. systematic errors in this lab include the photogate not being calibrated correctly, consistently measuring the length of the string above or below the expected values, consistently starting or stopping the stopwatch too late or too early, and the string of the pendulum being too thick to be able to align it exactly with a mark on the protractor. random errors could be reduced by having the same person fulfilling the same task across all trials and using more precise equipment. systematic errors could be reduced by repeating measurements for several more trials and taking an average of the measured values and re-calibrating equipment.

	a major constraint in this experiment that may limit the generalizability of the results is how many times the experiment was able to be repeated. if the experiment was able to be repeated several more times for several more trials, more data points and measurement could be collected and analyzed, leaving less room for both systematic and random error. resulting averages would be more accurate and precise, and therefore the measurements would be more generalizable. our group made our best effort to be precise in our measurements of length of string and angle of release to reduce the chance of any errors. this proved to give valid data because the data points fit within the trendline very well, with an r2 value of 0.999 (figure 4).
