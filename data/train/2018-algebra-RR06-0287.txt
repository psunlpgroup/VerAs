discussion. 

when completing the experiment, we varied the weight of the hanging mass (or the force applied) and measured the resulting acceleration of the cart. the experiment that we conducted allowed us to create a mathematical model for our results by finding the trendline of the graph of our results (figure 1.).  when looking at the data points in figure 1., we can see that the horizontal error bars correlate to the uncertainty of the scale that we used to measure mass.  the smallest the scale could read was .05g and that is how we determined our uncertainty.  the vertical error bars correlate to the uncertainty of the data studio program that measured the acceleration of the cart.  the program gave us uncertainty values for each data point we collected, and those values correlate to the error bars on the graph. these values are too small to be seen on the graph but are represented.  the small size of the error bars means that there was little error in the collection of our data and resulted in more accurate data.  the graph of our data gave us a trendline that showed the model of $y=c x + c$ and an actual equation of $y=5.34 x+0.006$.  we can use this equation to compare it to a calculated theoretical mathematical model ($a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$), given the mass of our system.  when we compare our theoretical model to our experimental model it will allow us to understand if our experimental data was significant or not and calculate the external forces acting upon our system.

present the findings of at least two other groups. (inserting a photo converted to a pdf file of a whiteboard is fine, as long as the information is readable. the report file that you submit to bb must be < 10 mb.) these are outside sources that must be cited properly. discuss whether the results of these groups support or refute your own group’s claim. 


they had the same theoretical c1 value of 5.34 but they got a different experimental value for c1, being 4.6961 where ours was 5.34.  this shows that they had more error in their experiment than we did, but it is still relatively similar to our value. 3g1b(figure 4.) and dusty pigeons(figure 5.) had larger fext values than we did with values of .0179 and .0038. this supports our model because they had more error in their c1 theoretical and experimental which would mean that they would have more external forces in their system than we did.  


the theoretical equation for acceleration of the cart is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$.  when we look at our experimental model it is in the form of $a=c1 w+c2$.  this allows us to better understand the individual components. of the theoretical equation and compare the theoretical equation to the experimental equation.  c1 is 1/msys while $c2=\frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$


there can be many external forces that are acting upon our system such as air resistance, friction, ect.  these forces will show up in the experimental model in the value of c2.  $c2=\frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. because we know the mass of the system, we can figure out the value of the external forces acting on our system.  this value represents the external forces acting on our system and the error that it can cause. 


the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model as c1.  c1 is 1/msys. we know the mass of the system by measuring the values of the cart and string with weights allowing this value to be known.  


a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart would have an influence on the uniform acceleration of the cart. the mass of the string is included in the weight of the system.  if the string was weightless, the mass of the system would go down and the acceleration would go up if the same force was applied.  the acceleration would still be constant, but it would be higher due to the equation $f=m a$.  the string we used had very little mass, if any (because of the smallest measurement of weight on the scale) and therefore would have a small if any difference in our experiment, but theoretically, the mass of the system would go down and the acceleration would increase but stay constant.  


 there could be random error in the scale because of the ability of the readings of the measurements.  the smallest unit of measurement creates error when reading and is accounted for by the level of uncertainty of our measurements.  this accounts for the possible random error and can reduce the error in our data sets. in our experiment, we had to use another groups track for our experiment 06 because our data studio system was not working.  we created random error because there could have been a lack of uniformity between the two tracks and it could have introduced new random errors that we didn’t see on our track.  this could have included things like difference in air flow or function of pulley.  the unknown changes in the system could have led to changes that could have been avoided if we would have been able to use the same track for both of our experiments.   

 there could have been systematic error in our scale if it was not zeroed properly.  this can lead the data to sway more negative or more positive to the true value.  this error can be reduced by properly calibrating the scales.  there also could have been systematic error in the potentially frictionless surface of the track.  if the tracks air system was not working properly and it created unintentional friction, this could have led to error within our data.  testing the track for uniformity and performance of the air flow system can lead to more precise data. 


the generalizability is limited because the carts and bobs vary in masses. and different masses (of the system or the hanging mass) will lead to different accelerations which are used to calculate our results. this makes our results specific to our masses and less general (less applicable to the experiments of others).  because these masses vary, it would be pretty hard for another group to replicate our experiment exactly, as was shown when groups had the same experiment to complete but obtained vastly different results.  for our experiment to become more general, we would need to use masses that had a more exact value of mass and didn’t vary as much.  also putting into place more control variables would allow the conditions of the experiment to become more reproducible.
