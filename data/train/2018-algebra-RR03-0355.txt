discussion and conclusion: 

the question that was being researched was what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings. when analyzing the mass vs. the period of the pendulum, in this experimental trial it did not show that it had an affect on the average times. in figure 3, it can be seen that the error bars are very small, which means that it does not have a lot of shared values between the values found. for the angle versus the period of the pendulum, there was no correlation between the 2 variables and the error bars were so small in figure 4 that there is no overlapping between them. but as seen in figure 5, the length versus the period of the pendulum did have a positive correlation and the error bars were bigger than the other graphs, which means that they have more shared values and that they have a better standard deviation. the equation 2(pi) square root l/g, shows that the length of the string has a direct effect on the period and it can be shown more so because of gravity. this is all supported by figure 5, the length vs. period of the pendulum and figure 2. 

random errors can be shown by the air flow in the room. the systematic errors can be shown by the time that it takes to push stop on the stopwatch, and improper measurements of the weight of the pendulum. some “grey” area errors were the improper measurement of the angle of the pendulum and not dropping it from the same height each time. there were many other errors that could have occurred but were not accounted for due to just not knowing them or they had little to no effect on the outcome that the length had the greatest correlation to the period of the pendulum.
