the purpose of this lab is to determine the relationship between the force being applied to a system and the acceleration of the system. the experiment addresses this problem by keeping the mass of the system constant and moving its mass from the sled being pulled to the hanging mass doing the pulling. this creates more force being applied to the system, increasing the acceleration of the system as indicated in figure 1. as the hanging mass increases and therefore the applied force increases, so does the acceleration. figure 1 demonstrates a positive relationship between the variables. as shown in figures 2 and 3, other groups found a positive relationship between the force applied to and the acceleration of a system. group 1 had a positive slope of 17.609 while group 77.5 had a slope of 0.0042. group 1 does have a significantly larger slope than our group at 4.309 and group 77.5 at 0.0042 which indicates some possible unit discrepancies. the theoretical model for a singular force acting on a system would be $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ which does not match our mathematical model because the y-intercept of ours is not zero. this indicates that more than one force is acting on the system. the theoretical model for this would be $a =\frac{f_{hanging}+f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$ . the mathematical model of our data is $a = 4.309 f + 0.055$ so the 4.309 is equivalent to the reciprocal of the system mass and the y-intercept of 0.055 is equivalent to the unknown forces divided by the system mass. the experimental model matches the enhanced theoretical model as they are both linear. the unknown forces include forces such as the limited amount of friction, possible knots or catches in the string creating drag, and the possibility of the track not being level increasing or decreasing the acceleration based on its slant. in the case of a heavy string being used instead of one with negligible mass, the acceleration would not be constant as the sled moves along the track. as it moves, more string would be a part of the hanging mass, causing a greater force to be applied throughout the trial. the slope of this graph would not follow a linear fit indicating a constant change in acceleration. errors in this lab could have occurred in the fact of the string having knots and snags in it which may have caused momentary dips in the acceleration so in future experiments, and new string would be used. another source of error would be in the setup of the track. if any of the holes were blocked, moments of increased friction could have slowed the acceleration. also, if the track was at a slant, the sled may move faster or slower, causing a systematic change in acceleration. another error could have occurred with the release of the sled. the human hand could have provided some force to the sled, possibly altering its acceleration. to prevent this, a lever mechanism could be used to holds it in place and releases it with a button. constraints of this lab include limited time to test, which could have increased the precision of the results, and the precision of the instruments may have resulted in some systematic errors affecting the accuracy of the results.
