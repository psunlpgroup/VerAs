discussion and conclusion 

the purpose of this experiment was to discover how the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes. the acceleration vs. hanging weight graph followed a linear pattern and had the equation $y=4.8456 x$. 019.this proves that the force and acceleration are directly proportional to each other and that as the force increases, the acceleration will increase as well. the hanging weights with more mass have faster accelerations. 

the findings of two other groups were collected. group three had similar results to ours. their hypothesis was that changing the mass at the end of the cart will affect the slope of the velocity vs. time graph. the mass of their system was 0.18 kg which was the mass of my group’s system. the graph is linear and has a positive slope which means that there is a positive correlation between mass and acceleration. if the mass of the system increases, so will the acceleration. their c1 was 5.30 which was close to my group’s c1 of 5.27. their c2 of -0.0717 was greater than my group’s c2.  the data from group three supports my group’s claims.

 group five (hanson, mann,vobanic) also had similar results to my group’s. their hypothesis was is  the mass on the hanging end of a frictionless pulley is related to the acceleration of the system. the mass of their system was 0.18 kg which was the mass of my group’s system. their graph is linear and has a positive slope which means that there is a positive correlation between mass and acceleration. if the mass of the system increases, so will the acceleration. their c1 was 4.93 which is further away from my group’s c1 of 5.27. the c2 of -0.0102 is close to my group’s c2.  the data from group five also supports my group’s claims.

the theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by a single force is is  $a=\frac{m_h}{m_{sys}} +\frac{f_f}{m_{sys}}$. this could be rearranged as is  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ . this theoretical equation supports the mathematical model found in lab $y = 4.8456 x - 0.019$ because the system mass is increasing at an constant rate. 

the enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by more than one force is is  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ this theoretical equation supports the mathematical model found in lab $y = 4.8456 x - 0.019$. there is extra forces like fext divided by the mass of the system.  

if a heavy string is connected to a cart, the acceleration will increase. we know that mass and acceleration are proportional and if the mass increases, so will the acceleration. the string will add mass to the system which will cause the cart to speed up. random errors in this experiment include error in the measuring of the system or scale errors. this could be reduced by making sure that the scale is read correctly. some constraints are that the mass of the system has to remain constant, but this will not greatly impact the results.
