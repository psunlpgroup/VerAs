discussion and conclusion

	in this lab the period of a pendulum relative to the components was investigated. throughout the three experiments done, there were three components tested, release angle, mass of the bob and length of the string attached. the first experiment tested the most variables, establishing the most effective change to the pendulum was the change in length, as shown in the data tables, table 1 shows the largest variation between the times at different intervals compared to figures 2 and 3 for mass and angle. experiment two tested the angle of release more in depth and discovered that the angle of release does not truly affect the period of the pendulum. finally, experiment three confirmed and solidified the finding of the correlation between length of period and the length of the string. some trials, especially in experiment one had to be redone for the sake of accuracy and to help refine the data and remove the human error. through redoing portions of each lab the data became more refined and we were more aware of what we were looking for and how to find it.
