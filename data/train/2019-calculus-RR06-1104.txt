conclusion

lab 5 was meant for us to see how the increase of the mass would change the acceleration of the system

lab 6 was made for us to see how external forces can change the acceleration of a system.



the slope of the graph is acceleration. the intercept was the frictional force.

for the equations in labs 5 and 6 the slope was found by increasing the masses of the bobbers so that acceleration would increase. the friction was found by finding the y intercept.

if the track is at a negative angle, then the acceleration increases. if the angle is positive, then the acceleration decreases. 


the more magnets there are the smaller the acceleration. 


horizontal forces from the air track.

there could be a vacuum chamber that uses magnets to keep the cart off the track.

extra friction from the string on the wheel and wheel grip.

making sure the wheel is well kept with good lubrication as well as good grip for the string with a coarse material.

the magnetic forces not being perfectly places opposite each other

there could be spots already designated in the cart that are put in by a machine


the use of the air track could cause there to be a constant shift in the data. if it was held by magnets, then there would only be the vertical magnetic force.

the use of bobbers of weights can be very inconsistent. if standard weights were used it would be more accurate and better for constant intervals.

the results were consistent with the second law. all of the values worked out with the addition of frictional force.
