discussion and conclusion:

	the purpose of this lab was to find any correlation between applied force and acceleration, as well as to identify how they are correlated if they are. the general conclusion from design template 1 and 2 was that the applied force and acceleration are causal when x y and z variables are constant. the acceleration is dependent on applied force (as applied force increases, acceleration increases, while other values that may affect the experiment are held constant) and mass of the system (as mass of the cart increases, the acceleration decreases, while other values are held constant). the group also concluded that both graphs have a linear relationship according to r^2 value. the mathematical model for linear equation is $y=b + mx$ where m and b are the values of great significance for this experiment, in sense that m is 1/mass and $b = \frac{f_{unknown}}{m}$ when derived from the equation $f = f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}$. the error bars were gathered off the uncertainties of the measurement system but were too small to be seen. the other groups’ data supported ours as the only time they weren’t at least very similar was when the data was graphed in different units.

knowing that f is equal to m*a from the second newton’s law, it can be derived that $a =\frac{f}{m}$. the value of f can be viewed as the sum of all forces that affect the object. in first experiment, $f = f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}$. plugging this back to the equation, it can be concluded that $a =\frac{f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}}{m}$. if the m was distributed to both f values, which can be viewed as the mathematical model for linear equation, $y = c1 x +c2$.

 for the second experiment, knowing that f is equal to m*a from the second newton’s law, it can be derived that $a =\frac{f}{m}$. this can also be rewritten as $a = f m^{-1}$. this representation of the second newton’s law suggests that there is a power relationship between iv and dv.

	if a heavy string was used for the system, the applied force would increase which would increase the acceleration. in this experiment, there are multiple variables that may impact the results of our data and the experiment. even though there is negligible friction, the air resistance can affect the acceleration of the system as systematic error that slows the cart. additionally, the track could have deficiencies in it where the air being pushed out is inconsistent so there could be slight dips on the air the cart rides on to create a frictionless system. the track may have a slope that could produce a systematic error, increasing or decreasing the acceleration of the cart. any issues in the string or how well the pulley rotates, such as knots, could have led to a random error that influenced our results as well.

	some improvements that could be made to the experiment would be to remove any elements of friction and air resistance entirely. including the possibility of doing the experiment inside of a vacuum. another possible improvement to the experiment could be changing the masses from the fishing bobs to something that fits the cart and string better.
