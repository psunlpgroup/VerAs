Discussion and Conclusion

	The overall purpose of this lab was to determine how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. This experiment system included the hanging force and the cart. The mass of the system being constant at 188.6 +/- 0.05 g or 0.1886 kg. In Figure 1 shows, from the data of Table 1, that there is a linear relationship between both the hanging force and the acceleration of the frictionless cart. In Figure 1, the error bars are too small to be shown on the graph, and the values are Horizontal uncertainty is +/- 0.00049 N. Vertical Uncertainties are +/- 0.001, +/- 0.001, +/- 0.0011, +/- 0.00157, +/- 0.00223, +/- 0.00347, +/- 0.00467 m/s^2. The experimental model is $y=c1 x+ c2$, which produced $y=4.9362 x-0.0102$, on the Figure 1, after the trials were ran from Table 1. From this the c1 of the experimental model can be derived and is c1 is 1/.1886 so 5.302 and the mathematical model found it was 4.9362. From this data the Fext was able to be obtained, with a value of -0.00206 N.  From Figure 2, Group 1, mathematical model was $y= 5.0137 x-0.0018$, the experimental c1 was calculated to be 5.327, and the Fext is -0.000359 N. From Figure 3, Group 5, mathematical model was, $y= 5.3 x-0.0717$, the experimental c1 value of 5.37, and a Fext value of -0.0135. Figure 2 and Figure 3 results both support that there is a linear relationship between acceleration and the applied force. If acceleration increases the hanging force increases, if acceleration decreases the hanging forces decreases. 
	 The experimental equation is $y=c1 x+ c2$ and the theoretical equation for this experiment is $F_{total}=m_{sys} a$. In the theoretical equation Î£F is the sum of all forces, msys is the mass of the system, which is the cart and the bobs which are attached, and a is the acceleration. In the experimental equation, as previously stated, c1 is equal to 4.9362 and c2 is equal to -0.0102, and x is equal to acceleration. The force that may be present in the experimental context is gravity. It is represented in the experimental model by the equation $= \frac{m_{hang} g}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_f}{m_{sys}}$ with a being the acceleration which is represented as x in the experimental model. The mass of the system shows up in the experimental model as the value of c1, which is 1/msys. A non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart might affect the uniform acceleration of the cart by needed to add the mass of the string to the mass of the system, doing so will not affect the acceleration. The possibility of systematic errors in the experiment that would impact the results are not having the balance calibrated correctly. If the balance is not calibrated correctly then the mass measurements would constantly be higher or lower than the true value. Having a correctly calibrated balance would result in more accurate masses and therefore more accurate data. Another possible systematic error would be the Data Analysis program not being calibrated with the cart. If this were to happen, then the results that were to be produced would be inconstant, causing the velocities to be either higher to lower, and the accelerations to be not accurate.
