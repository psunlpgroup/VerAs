conclusion:
	In conclusion, regarding our given research question, we were able to eliminate some IVâ€™s like the weight of the mass and the angle of release. This can be supported with the following graphs. You can see that when mass is your IV, there is no strong relationship When Angle of Release is your IV, there is also no strong relationship. So that only leaves the Length of String as the most crucial variable, the others do not have the same importance as the Length of the string


	The Theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$, this equation is supported by our mathematical model because the period (T) is reliant on the length of the string to have a similar curve, or slope. Some random errors that occurred were Drag, and Temperature. Other systematic errors were caused by the delay of the shadow gate and precision of the length of the string. The constraints of this experiment are the materials given because tape measures and the protractors had some impact in our data, but because everyone was able to have the same results shows how non-precise instruments are able to show how generalized the results are.
