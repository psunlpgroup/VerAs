discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of this experiment was to develop mathematical models to explain the behavior of a real two mass system as well as to develop an understanding for each variable that and numerical value that makes up said mathematical model. the first experiment of lab 05 as described in table 1 was conducted to show the positive linear relationship between acceleration and force as shown in figure 3, which provides us with the mathematical model $y=4.2024 x - 0.008$. the coefficient in front of the x term (acceleration) is determined to be 1/ (mass of the system). the coefficient is discussed and tested further in lab 06 figures 6-8 and is found to be the acceleration due to external forces acting on the system. the second experiment conducted in lab 05 displayed in figure 4 shows the decreasing power relationship between acceleration vs. mass.  the mathematical model provided by this experiment is shown in figure 4 which takes the form of $y=0.574 x^{0.888}$. the coefficient is determined to be the constant force of m2*gravity while the exponent is supposed to -1 or in other words is supposed to take the inverse of the x term, mass of m1. the final set of experiments in lab 06 were performed and displayed in figures 6-8 which supported the claim that the value of the y-intercept in the mathematical model in figure 3. is a representation of the acceleration due to external forces acting on the system? this was concluded by showing that when more frictional force, which acts in the opposite direction of motion, was added with each trial, the y-intercept of the mathematical models from figures 6-8 decreased.
	the results from the magnet-based experiment that was conducted in lab 06 by team 6 only showed that the y-intercept of the mathematical models describing the relationship between acceleration decreased as the frictional force increased. the results from team 2 in figure 10. generalize this conclusion further to expand the definition to acceleration due to any force that opposes the acceleration due to m2*gravity. this backwards tilt would make it so that a portion of the normal force acting on m1 would act in the opposite direction of motion. the models from team 1 in figure 9. let us expand this definition to any external force acting on the system since the forward tilt provides the opposite effect on the normal force of that shown by team 2 and therefore their models reflect that by increasing the y-intercept. by combing each of these experiments together it can be concluded that the y-intercept of the graph of the acceleration vs. force of a two-mass system such as the one shown in figure 1. changes according to the magnitude and direction of the external forces acting on the system aside from the measured force of m2*gravity.

	there was a small amount of random error in the measurement of the acceleration as the tool used had an error of +- 0.001, which was determined to not have a visibly significant impact of the trend present in the data set for the set of experiments. nothing could be done to reduce this error aside from get even more accurate equipment which was unnecessary in this case. there was also random error present in the way that the masses were measured since the balances could only be accurate to a specific mass. the only way to reduce this would have been to get a more accurate balance. systematic errors could include not having a perfectly frictionless track which would impact the external forces acting on the system. using some tool to measure the balance of the frictionless track and adjusting the tilt of the track could have corrected some of this error.

the results of this experiment only apply to a track that is consistently frictionless and under the constant acceleration due to gravity of the earth. while at the track having external forces was tested, any variance in the amount of friction at a given point along the track would impact the accuracy and validity of the mathematical models produced. gravity being different than that of the earth, which the experiment was conducted on, would affect the values of any and all accelerations in the y direction.

the first mathematical model from lab 05 in figure 3. which is generalized to $a =\frac{f_{external}}{m_{sys}}$  exactly mirrors newton's second law. if you break up the law into $f_g m2 +f_{external}=  m_{system} a$ we can solve for acceleration and we are left with our first mathematical model. the second model in figure 4. is generalized to $a =\frac{m2 g}{m1}$ , we essentially have the equation from newton’s second law solved for acceleration directly where $a =\frac{f}{m}$.
