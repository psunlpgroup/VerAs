conclusion:

this experiments purpose was to test three different independent variables to see which one affect the dependent variable (duration of one period). these independent variables were weight, string length, and angle of drop. through multiple experiments it was found that the independent variable was the string length. this was because, as stated and graphed above, when the weight variable was tested with string length and angle drop being the controls it was found to not affect the duration of one period as the times were all the same for each different weight tested and the same goes the angle drop. when the angle was tested, and the weight and string length were the controls it was shown through our data that the angle did not affect the duration of one swing as the time for each different angle was relatively the same. we then hypothesized that string length would be our independent variable in this experiment. through multiple tests with varying string lengths and weight and angle drop being our controls, it was found that string length did in fact affect the duration of one period swing. we found our theoretical equation to be $y=0.1984 x^{0.5126}$. the theoretical model we found on google shows that the pendulum period of an object with a length of .5m should be 1.419 seconds and our tested model shows our period to be 1.4737 seconds. this shows that they are very similar which verifies that our data is accurate. some errors within the experiment is human error. the accuracy of the timing was greatly improved with the help of a motion detector instead of human eye and reaction using a timer. more trials could be done to strength our results.
