conclusion:
the research question for this lab was: what things can affect the period of the pendulum? by changing the mass of the bob, we were able to determine that there was no significant difference between the mass of the bob and the period of the pendulum (figure 1). these followed a linear model. the length of the string did have a small effect on the period of the pendulum in the data that we found in lab period one, but it did have an effect that we found in lab period three (figures 2 versus 3). it had an exponential relationship, showing that there is a significant relationship between the period of the pendulum and the length of the string (figure 3). the angle of release did not have a significant impact on the period, as was shown in the graphs provided during labs two and three, as we did not have enough time in lab period one to complete this experiment. in the given graph, the points followed a linear model. some systematic errors may have been that the protractor or measuring tape may have been faded, or the string may have moved after adding the weights on to the bob. some random errors may have been that the angle of release may have not been exact every time, the time we started or stopped the timer may not have been exact, and we may not have measured the string from the same spot every time. one thing that constrained our data was that we were not able to complete all three experiments during the first week of the lab. and the ones that we did complete were rushed because we were running out of time, so the data we may have collected during the first week may not be exact either.
