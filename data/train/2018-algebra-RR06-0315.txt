discussion and conclusions

the purpose of this experiment was to determine how the acceleration of a system changed when the applied force is changed. based on the mathematical model the data should be linear which is supported by figure 2 in which the data from figure 1 which is the experimental data is shown as a linear line this tells us as the applied force is increased the acceleration should increase at an even rate. this answers how the acceleration is affected by the applied force. the other groups data found in figures 4 and 5 support our groups findings based on the fact they have almost identical mathematical models only slightly different due to rounding and or small differences in measurements but still give a linear line when graphed. the mathematical and theoretical models are formatted the same way the only differences are that the experimental model would take into account forces other than the applied. the forces that would show up in the experimental other than the applied would be friction and air resistance and in the experimental model they would show up as constant 2 or c2. the mass of the system would be constant 1 or c1. if a non-massless string would be used the acceleration would no longer be uniform because as the system moved the applied force would increase causing the rate at which the system accelerates to increase. the only errors that were assumed to have occurred were systematic namely the measuring of mass which was dealt with by zeroing the scale and the effect of air resistance and friction which were ignored during testing but could be minimalized by using a near frictionless surface and a vacuum chamber to remove air resistance. the main constraint would be the air track used to simulate a near frictionless surface because it might be worn down or not as consistent as others.
