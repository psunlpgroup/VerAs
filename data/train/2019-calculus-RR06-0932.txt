conclusion:
the purposes of lab 05 and lab 06 were to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model, respectively. the three experiments conducted, as well as their corresponding graphs and data, facilitated our team coming to the stated mathematical models through the application of newton’s second law to the data and graph’s lines of best fit. in these models there are three variables is  m (mass of the bobs), g (gravitational acceleration), and a (acceleration). the acceleration of the second model is the value set equal to a which is just a constant because the acceleration was held constant. the mg is the force of gravity on the mass of bobs, and the two constants represent the inverse of the mass and the tension of the model divided by the mass. the mathematical model is derived from the equation  $m g-t=m a$ which translates to $a=\frac{mg}{m} + \frac{t}{m}$.  there was a possibility for human error and inaccuracy with reading of measurements (mass, length, starting position, or angle), and there was also a chance for error due to our malfunctioning computer program. our group would run tests and the computer program we were using to measure the velocity of each run would sometimes come back with an error forcing us to shut the system down and reboot it. the frictionless track used in this experiment make these results less general, and so does the relatively frictionless pulley system because friction is an extremely common constraint.  

newton’s second law  $f=m a$ is no different from our equation, which uses mg and t in it       ($m g-t=m a$). the second mathematical model is just the constant value of acceleration because its independent variable (t) is not correlated to the acceleration of the system, so, since the mass stays the same, so too does the acceleration.
