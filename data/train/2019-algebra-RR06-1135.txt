discussion and conclusion

the research question asked prior to this experiment was “what effects the acceleration of a system?” to test this research question, we were given an vacuumed air track (gets rid of air resistance), a cart, and a pulley attached with weights. the experiment determining whether mass  effected the acceleration of a pulley system helps answer this. we chose eight (8) different weights and tested them in the system, moving them from the hanging force to the cart and testing both placements of the weight. for both, data showed that our hypothesis was correct and that mass did have an effect on acceleration of a system however we do not believe that it is a significant difference(table 1, table 2). the experiment determining whether or not the hanging force effects acceleration or not addresses the research question. to adjust the hanging force but not adjusting mass (which we just learned did not effect the system) we tested the upward tilt of the end of the track. to do this, we placed small blocks underneath the end of the track that is closer to the hanging force, increasing the upward angle between the horizontal and the track. this was tested three (3) separate times with different tilts. these results are shown in data part 1, part 2, and part 3, along with in figures 3, 4, and 5. these three experiments can be combined to also aid in answering the research question as to whether or not tilt is one of the factors that change the acceleration of a system (experimental template-overarching). in conclusion, it was found that the tilt is a factor that effects the acceleration of a system and that it effects it with a slight positive correlation. however, the slope of the line created by each of these measures is not very strong, suggesting that the effect is not large as well.
