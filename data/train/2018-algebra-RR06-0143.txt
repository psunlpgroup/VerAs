discussion:

	in this lab we answered the research question of “how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes?”. we answered this by performing experiments and analyzing the data shown in the tables and graphs above. we know the equation $f=m a$ is highly prevalent here, and this showing that we should have a linear line. if we want to solve for acceleration, then we know $a=\frac{f}{m_sys}$. we obtained a equation of $y=m x$ (y is .0051x) where since it is multiplication the m in the slope is  1/mass. this relates to our data because 1 over our mass of the entire pully system (cart weight plus avg of all bobbers) was 149.8+4.925x8  is 189.2. 1/189.2 is roughly .0051. in table 1 we give the experimental template, showing our dependent variables, the independent variables, what we controlled for, our prediction, and our testable hypothesis. table 2 gives data regarding the weight of the bobbers in the pully system, and the uncertainty in the mass, also reflected on the force, which is determined from mass.  the experiment we performed involved having a cart move on a track, with a certain amount of weight hanging off a pully system (the independent variable) and testing how fast the acceleration (dependent variable) was at each varying weight, this data is shown in table 3, and figure 1. in figure 1, error bars are present although very small, and can not be seen. the error bars are vertical error bars and horizontal error bars, each stemming from a different set of data. the vertical error bars were determined in each trial, as a new uncertainty was given for each data point. if the uncertainty was below our scale error of .001, we were to use .001 instead, as is done for trial 1, seen in table 3. for the horizontal error bars the uncertainty in mass was used, which was obtained in table 2. the uncertainty in weighing the bobbers being .10351. 

	in this experiment there were multiple trials ran by different groups of people. this gives a better understanding of the experiment by giving multiple sets of data. having multiple trials of the experiment also gives more accurate results.  



here is the data of another group in our lab, the data shows the same hypothesis, and the same format of data. with their system mass displayed as 181.23g which is around the same as ours was. we all obtained the same mathematical model of $a=c1 f-c2$. the data presented is very similar to ours, except with varying forces and acceleration as expected. the biggest difference we noticed with our data and theirs, is that theirs has a b component to their experimental model ours did not. their equation was $y=.0042 x-.081$, and ours was .0051x. this could be due to several factors, such as a very small amount of uncertainties in our data, or due to a certain amount of random error making up for the systematic error. we also compared with another group, to obtain more accurate data. this data did support our results and conclusions overall, showing a positive trend as ours did. this supports the claim that the more hanging mass, the faster the pully will accelerate. 



	the other groups data is presented below. with the same similarities as before, similar mass of system, and similar data obtained. but again, the experimental model differed from ours, by having a b value once again. theirs being .0061x+.1119, while ours being .0051x.  this data also supports our claims and results, showing that positive correlation, as with more hanging force, the faster the pully system accelerates.  

	in this we all began with the same theoretical equation of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ as stated earlier. we could also look at this equation more in depth as there are more factors to this system, this more indepth equation would be written as $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. using this equation and the data obtained we were able to obtain the experimental mathematical model as shown in the pictures of data above. $a=c1 f-c2$. this data directly relates to the theoretical equation, as c1 was 1/mtotal f was the applied force (mhg) , a was the acceleration (m/s^2), and c2 was the b obtained from our graph, but since we didn’t have one our equation was simplified to $a=c1 f$. we used this model combined with our data from last week to calculate the amount of hanging mass that was needed to get to an acceleration given to us by our instructor. 

we were given an acceleration of .5, and given a heavier cart, and differing bulbs, and also paper clips to make up the inevitable difference in weight. overall when modifying the equation to look more like our data and to solve for the correct unknown we obtained $m_h=\frac{m_c (a-c2)}{g-a-c2}$ whereas mh was the hanging mass, and mc was the mass of the cart, and we had no c2 which made it significantly easier. we plugged in our values that we obtained, mc is296.9g,  a is acceleration is .5m/s^2, g is gravity is  9.8m/s^2.  this gave us mh is 296.9((.5)/(9.8-.5) which is 15.962. this means that our hanging mass had to be 15.962g. after gathering this weight in paperclips and bulbs, (we obtained exactly 15.95) we attached this weight to the cart and set the cart at 850mm. after running the experiment, we obtained a acceleration of .491m/s^2, this was off by .009 but that could be due to many underlying errors.  these errors could have been random errors, such as accidentally bumping the cart, or pushing it slightly when you release it, or having false measurements in weights due to the mechanical scale. most of the errors were systematic in this experiment. the general amount the scale is typically off could be an error, the amount the rotary motion detector would be off is also a systematic error in the experiment. these errors could have been easily reduced, if we were to calibrate each tool beforehand, and take extra precaution while running the experiment. this experiment could also be improved with more time, more trials, and a bigger setting. these were the major constraints of this lab, as with all experiments, more trials would have been able to be conducted with more time, this would give us a more accurate data set. also, in a bigger setting we could test it with more mass, more hanging mass, and a greater differing of accelerations. overall though we obtained very valid data, allowing for the accurate estimation of how to get to a certain acceleration, and following the theoretical model to get the data.
