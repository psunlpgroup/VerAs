conclusion:
the purpose of these experiments was to determine the dependent variable that impacts the length of the period of a pendulum. as shown above in graph 1, the mass of a counterweight will not affect the length of a period. this is because as the mass increases, the velocity of the pendulum will also increase, resulting in similar times even with increased mass. in addition, as shown by graph 2, the angle of release will not affect the period of the pendulum. this is because as the angle of release is increased, the velocity of the pendulum will also increase, resulting in a similar period length. however, as shown by graph 3, the length of string has a positive correlation with the length of a period, because as the length of the string increases, the period of the pendulum increases. our mathematical model is very similar to the theoretical model. the power of 2pi(length/gravity)^(1/2) is very close to our exponent of 0.4481. this means our equation would be 2.0811*(length)^(1/2), where the 2pi/square root of gravity term is 2.007, very close to our coefficient of 2.0811.  the constraints on our experiment included the similar weights used by all teams, the same string used across all teams, and the same photogate program and timers used across all teams. some errors our team encountered was the use of stopwatches, which as detailed above we used two stopwatches and took averages to cut down on the random error.
