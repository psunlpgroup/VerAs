discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab was to determine how the acceleration of a system changes when the force applied to the system changes and to develop a mathematical model to predict the motion of an object due to an applied force. 

in the experiment, the system used was the cart, 8 bobbers, and the string. the total mass of this system is 186.3 g. 9 different trials were conducted, and the hanging weight was changed on each trial from zero bobbers, to one, to two and so forth until all 8 bobbers were hanging from the string to become the hanging weight. the data collected throughout the experiment can be seen in table 2. at the end of the experiment, an excel graph was created from the data (as seen in figure 1) and the mathematical model that was determined to best fit the data was a linear model $y=4.9681 x + 0.007$ with an r-squared value of .997. as can be seen in figure 1, this linear model shows that as the applied force increases, the acceleration of the system consistently increases as well, resulting in a linear line with a slope of 4.968. 

other similar experiments were conducted, and their results were recorded.

as seen above, group 1 (2018) and group 3 (2018) both determined a linear mathematical model very similar to the one determined from our own data. the other groups data and mathematical model therefore support our own claim of a linear model showing that as applied force increases, so does the acceleration of the system.

the experimental ($a=c1 w+c2$) and theoretical models ($a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$) support each other, however differ slightly because of possible other external forces on the system, the mass of the system, and systematic errors. some other forces other than the hanging weight that may be present include tension of the string and force of gravity. since the air track is considered frictionless, friction does not influence the system. to calculate the applied force in the system, the mass of the system was used. the bobbers were weighed with the string in grams. the value was then converted to kg and then multiplied by the value of gravity (9.8 m/s^2) to find the value for the force in newtons. this shows that as the mass increased so did the force indirectly, as can be seen in the linear model described above. since in this experiment the string weight is negligible, if the string length was changed to be an appreciable mass, then the cart would still undergo uniform acceleration because the string weight is not a changing value and remains constant throughout. when the acceleration of a system is affected by more than one force, the enhanced theoretical equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$Â is used to account for the extra forces. the experimental mathematical model also supports the enhanced theoretical model.

some possible systematic errors include the scale being improperly calibrated, the air track pulley system measurement being incorrect, the knot in the string, or an incorrect initial measurement of the mass of the system. all these errors would cause our data to be consistently higher or lower than the correct data. some possible random errors could include human error in measuring the mass of the bobbers, or the pulley being improperly set up. to avoid these errors, we used the datastudio program to help eliminate human measurement errors and we were very careful when measuring the mass of the bobbers and the system. 

the constraints that may limit the generalizability of our results is that a very large system mass was not physically able to be tested, which limited our data set to only relatively small masses.
