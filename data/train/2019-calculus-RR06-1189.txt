discussion and conclusion
the purpose of the lab is to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model. the lab investigates how the force applied to the system and the mass of the cart affect the acceleration of the system.

	the first experiment investigates how the force applied to the system affects the acceleration of the system. the resulting mathematical model is $a=2.6239 f - 0.009$ where a is the acceleration of the system and f is the force applied to the system. in the experiment, the total mass of the system is kept constant (at 337.9 g), while the mass of the hanging weight is tried with different values. the applied force to the system is calculated by the formula $f = m g$ where f is the applied force, m is the mass of the hanging weight (converted from grams to kilograms), and g is the gravity (9.81 m/s2). all collected data are presented in table 3. the values of the applied force and the acceleration of the system are plotted into the graph given in figure 1. using excel curve fitting tool, the graph is fitted by a linear trendline with equation $y = 2.6239 x - 0.0094$ and r2 is 0.9981. the resulting mathematical model is derived from this equation.
	the second experiment investigates how the mass of the cart affects the acceleration of the system. the resulting mathematical model is $a = 3e^7  m^{2.938}$ where a is the acceleration of the system and m is the mass of the cart. in the experiment, the mass of the hanging weight is kept constant (at 40.4 g) (therefore the force applied to the system is kept constant at 0.396 n), while the mass of the cart is tried with different values. all collected data are presented in table 4. the values of the mass of the cart and the acceleration of the system are plotted into the graph given in figure 2. using excel curve fitting tool, the graph is fitted by a power trendline with equation $y = 3e^7 x^{2.938}$  and r2 is 0.7239. the resulting mathematical model is derived from this equation.
	the third experiment is the same as the first experiment, except that the lab setting is changed when different amounts of forward tilts are added to the track. the methods used in the first experiment are repeated, but this time the track is forward tilted by 9.52 mm, 19.04 mm, and 28.54 mm. three experiments with three different tilts give three linear equations is  $a = 2.8736 f + 0.0064$ for the 9.52 mm tilt, $a = 2.8646  f + 0.0515$for the 19.04 mm tilt, and $a = 2.8616  f + 0.0922$ for the 28.54 mm tilt. though these equations are different, they have the same form $a = c1 f + c2$. c1 stays nearly the same for three equations, while c2 increases as the amount of tilt increases. these equations are also consistent with the equation in the first experiment. this experiment, together with newton's second law, helps discover the physical meanings of constants c1 and c2 in the first experiment. c1 represents 1/msystem, which explains why it stays constant with different tilts (msystem is always kept constant). c2 is the acceleration of the system when no force by the hanging weight is applied to it, which is caused by the tilted track.
	another group works on the same experiment as the third experiment, but adding backward tilt instead of forward tilt to the track. this is a figure of the resulting graphs that summarize their work is  (*)
	the findings of the group show that different backward tilts also give different linear equations of the form $a = c1  f + c2$. c1 stays the same for different tilts, while c2 decreases as the amount of the tilt increases. these equations differ from the equations given in our third experiment in the values of c2 - all of these values are negative instead of positive. this is a logical result as backward tilt makes the system accelerate backward, giving negative acceleration. therefore, these results are consistent with the physical meanings of c1 and c2 is  c1 is 1/msystem, and c2 is the acceleration of the system when no force by the hanging weight is applied to the system, which is caused by the tilted track (forward tilt gives positive acceleration, backward tilt gives negative acceleration).
	there may have random and systematic errors presented in the experiment. random errors may appear in the measuring devices as well as the experimenting methods. for example, the acceleration measuring device may imprecisely measure the acceleration of the cart, or the experimenter may inadvertently apply a force to the cart that affects its acceleration measurement. one way to reduce random errors is taking many trials with the same value of the independent variables and taking the average of all measurements as the final result. systematic errors also take account as other factors like the air resistance, the weight of the string, friction, and the initial tilt of the track. it is difficult to reduce systematic errors with the lab settings. designing a better experiment that accounts for these factors is a good way to reduce systematic errors.
	this experiment has some constraints that may limit the generalizability of the results. the systematic errors listed above are due to the constraints of this experiment. besides, the experiment may not investigate all factors that may impact the conclusions. the conclusions may not hold true anymore if some of the control variables are changed. for example, will the applied force linearly affect the acceleration of the system if the gravity is different (on another planet)?
	two mathematical models from the first and second experiments are consistent with newton's second law $f = m_{system} a$. for the first equation $a = c1 f + c2$, it is consistent with the theoretical equation is  $a = \frac{f}{m_{system}}$. $f = f_{applied} + f_{tilt}$, therefore $a = \frac{f_{applied} f_{tilt}}{m}$. this means that c1 is  1/msystem, and c2 is ftilt/msystem. in the first equation, c1 is 2.6239, which is pretty close to 1/msystem (2.96). c2 is 0.0094, which is pretty close to 0 (ftilt should be 0 because no tilt is added to the track). for the second equation $a = c1  m^{c2}$, it is consistent with the theoretical equation $a = \frac{f}{m_{system}}$ $a= f m_{system}^{-1}$. since $m_{system} = m_{cart} + m_{weight}$, this gives $a = f  (m_{cart} + m_{weight})-1$ where âˆ‘f and mweight are constant. while the exact values of c1 and c2 are not verified to be consistent with the theoretical equation, the power form of the model is consistent with the equation.
