discussion and conclusion
our original research question was “what affects the acceleration of the cart on the frictionless track?” the purpose of the first lab (lab 05) was to develop different mathematical models that help describe how the real system behaves. the purpose of the second lab (lab 06) was to further understand the different numerical values and variables include in each mathematical model. 
the first experiment in lab 05 examined how the mass on the end of the string affected the acceleration of the system (cart on track). after completing trials and recording the acceleration for ten different mass values, we converted the mass into force. plotting the data points produced a positive linear relationship between the force and the acceleration. we then placed the force (x) and acceleration (y) variables in the linear regression line for the given x-y variables. this created the mathematical model of $a=0.0026 f - 0.009$ for the first experiment in lab 05. we know that there is a positive linear relationship between the acceleration of the system and the mass of the weight on the end of the string because the error bars on the graph do not overlap, even when applying the equivalency criterion of +/- 2σ. 
the second experiment in lab 05 examined the relationship between the mass of the cart and the acceleration of the system. we conducted the experiment by measuring the acceleration at seven different cart masses. we plotted the data like we did in the first experiment with force on the x-axis and acceleration on the y-axis. the linear regression line should have produced an inverse relationship between the acceleration of the system and the mass of the cart. however, we plotted force on the x-axis when we should have plotted the mass of the cart (m1). this in turn caused our graph and mathematical to be different than what it should have been. the mathematical model that we produced w$a=2 e + 29.38 f$. similar to the first experiment, it is clear to discern a change in acceleration values when we apply the equivalency criterion. 
for the third experiment (lab 06), we examined the relationship between the acceleration of the system and a forward tilt of the track. to test this relationship, we performed eight trials of eight different masses for three different tilt measurements. we then recorded the acceleration values and plotted the data separately and then together for each tilt measurement. after, we plotted the linear regression models and substituted force for the x-variable and acceleration for the y-variable. doing this produced models of $a=2.8763 x+0.0064$, $a=2.8646 x+0.0515$, and $a=2.8616 x+0.0922$. in all three graphs, we can see a change in acceleration for each trial when applying the equivalency criterion.
this graph was created by group 6 in our lab, who completed the same experiment as we did. they tested three different forward tilts of the track and examined how they affected the acceleration of the system. all three of their slopes are about the same. also, the constants (y-intercepts) display an increase in acceleration as the front tilt increases. both findings support the results and findings from our experiment.
this picture contains the collected data from group 5 in our lab. they tested how a backwards tilt affects the acceleration of the system. the slopes from the five different graphs are all relatively the same. also, the constants (y-intercepts) gradually decrease as the as the backwards tilt increases, which displays that as the backwards tilt decreases, the acceleration of the system decreases. these findings support the data and findings that our group gathered. it seems that the backwards tilt (their iv) had a larger impact on the numerical values than ours, but it is difficult to tell due the small increases in backwards tilt.

the largest source of error during this experiment was human error. this could include not measuring the mass of the bobbers closely enough and not starting the track at the same spot every trial. both of these errors could either be random or systematic. another source of error could be not recording the acceleration on the measuring device accurately enough, which would result in either random or systematic error. 
one way to reduce the possibility of error would be to just be more careful and accurate with measurements and testing. another way to reduce error would be to record multiple trials for each measurement and take an average value for the acceleration. this would reduce the amount of random error in the acceleration measurements. 
one constraint in this experiment would be the size of the experiment, and more specifically the mass values used for the weight on the end of the string and for the cart. the mass reduces the generalizability of our results because the mass values are relatively small and close together. this means that the results may not be the same when the masses are larger and there is more change in the mass values. also, in terms of the size of the experiment, the track length may reduce the generalizability of the results of our experiments. since our track length did not change and remained on a relatively small scale, our results may not be indicative of the results if a longer track was used for the same experiment. another constraint of our experiment would be that the track was frictionless. having a frictionless track is not very applicable to the real world, so the results would most likely be different if we included friction into our experiment. 
we also ignored the strings mass and air resistance, which could affect our results. if we had used a heavy string, the acceleration of the system would decrease. since we neglected the mass of the string, the mass of the system was constant at the mass of the cart plus the mass of the weight on the end of the string. but, using a heavy string would increase the mass of the system would decrease the acceleration since the force remains the same and the equation to find the acceleration is $a=\frac{f}{m_{system}}$.
theoretical mathematical model is  $a=\frac{f}{m_{system}}$ (single force)
our first model of $a=0.0026 f - 0.009$ supports this mathematical model because the c1 value of 0.0026 is 1/mass, which fits into the theoretical model.
our second model of $a=2 e^{10} f^{2.938}$ does not follow the theoretical model since we used force. we should have used m1 in our mathematical model, which would have produced an inverse relationship between m1 and acceleration, which would also support and follow the theoretical model.
enhanced theoretical mathematical model is  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$(more than one force)

our first model of $a=0.0026 f - 0.009$ supports this enhanced mathematical model because the c2 value represents the fext/msystem in the equation.
