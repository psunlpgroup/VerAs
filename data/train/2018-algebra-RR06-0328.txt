conclusion:
The purpose of these labs was to determine if the force applied changes the acceleration of the system. In our experiment we set up a system where the total weight stayed the same, but the force applied changed. We did this by moving the weight from the cart to the string hanging off the pulley and this allowed us to measure if the applied force changed the acceleration. Our mathematical model was $y=46.976 x + 0.003$ and this had a Rsquared value of 0.9993, as seen in Figure #1. This means our graph shows a linear relationship between force applied and acceleration which means there was a direct relationship between the two. 

Both groups data showed a linear and direct relationship between force applied and acceleration which is what we got, so their data supports what we said. Their Rsquared values were very good (.9887 and .9905 respectively) and the slope of their mathematical models (44.343 and 47.344 respectively) were very close to our slope. The friction of the pulley on the rope and air current are other forces on hanging weight(or string of the hanging weight) and they show up in the experimental model because the slope is not as steep as the theoretical model. In the experiment model mass shows up as the variable x while in the theoretical model it shows up as m. If a non-massless string was used instead then it would change the acceleration because there is more weight as the pulley moves, therefore making it a nonlinear relationship. Possible systematic error was inaccuracy in the balance we used to weigh the mass of the cart and the precision of the acceleration detection mechanism. There might have been random error, but these couldnâ€™t of been avoided but would be weeded out through more testing. One constraint of this experiment was time which would limit our generalizability of our groups results, but because other groups had the same/similar results that helps us generalize our results.
