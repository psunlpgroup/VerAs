discussion and conclusion
	the purpose of this lab was to determine the acceleration of the cart while we manipulate the mass of the system and to determined the applied force of the system. using the string attached to the cart that has bobbers on it, we turned on the air track and let the mass of the bobbers pull the cart in one direction. using the software on the system, we were able to highlight the graph and read the acceleration of the system as well as the uncertainty values for each trial.

the mathematical model explains how the acceleration of the system is dependent on the hanging mass of the bobbers because as you observe the mathematical model ($f=m a$), you can see as we increased the mass of the bobbers, it also increase the acceleration of the system. we did this when we added more mass to the system by adding bobbers, it made the mass of the system higher which increase the acceleration. if these two values are increased, it will also affect the applied force by increasing that as well. if  you observe our graph you can see that there is a direct linear relationship between increasing the hanging mass and what that does to the acceleration. with this linear relationship, you can see that as one variable is increased, the other one is increased as well.

	according from these two labs groups, their data agrees with ours. you can see that both of the graphs are linear as ours are and are slopes are relatively close. the second group did applied force versus acceleration,  compared to the first group that graphed mass versus acceleration. either way these graphs are going to be a linear relationship explained in the paragraph above that explains the mathematical model. 



	according to the rubric,  we were able to determine that the theoretical model ($a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$) and the mathematical model $a=(\fraction{f_{app}}{m_{system}}) + c$ are related in some way. if we plug any of our mass values into our equation $y=4.5242 x +.01$ we will get a value of acceleration that is along the y axis. this agrees with our data and shows a relationship between this and the mathematical model. both of these equations are related in such a way that the theoretical model is derived from the mathematical model. the equations are the same, but f(ext) is taken into account for other factors influencing acceleration 



	in this lab, there are some random and systematic errors that could influence out acceleration values as well as our applied force. some systematic errors that could have came about in this lab were that the bobbers might have not been completely still. this may affect the value of the acceleration and make the readings of the computer inaccurate and may throw your applied force values off. another example of random error could be that the air track may not be distributing the air through the track evenly. if this is the case in some areas of the track, friction may be more than it would be in some areas and would slow down your acceleration values. these errors can be fixed by just making sure that the bobbers are not swinging, and that the air through the track is blowing through it the same throughout the path. some random errors may be air resistance as well as vibrations from the track since other group members were performing the same experiment at the same time. this may cause friction to be increased from the back and forth motion of the track. these errors may throw off your acceleration values as well as your applied force values. due to the errors being random, you can only try to reduce them and may not even notice that they are there. since air resistance is something that you are not able to eliminate or control, it is categorized as being random. 



	in this lab, you must take into account any constraints that may be possible. a constraint that is possible is that we only had a small amount of bobbers that we could use. we were not able to continue adding bobbers to see if the graph would remain linear or flatten out the heavier that the hanging mass came to be. due to the fact that we only had little data points to work with, all of the lab groups produced a linear graph that expressed the relationship of $f=m a$.
