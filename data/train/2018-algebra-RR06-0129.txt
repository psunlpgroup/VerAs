discussion and conclusion. 

the purpose of this experiment was to find out how acceleration of a system changes when applied force changes. we hypothesized that as the applied force increased on the cart, then the acceleration of the cart will increase as well. table 2 shows that as the hanging mass increased, so did the acceleration which indicates our hypothesis was proved right. also, in figure 1, we can see this linear trend as well.  the mathematical model obtained in figure 1 is $y=4.7102 x - 0.083$ which shows a linear relationship of acceleration increasing with more force due to hanging mass. this mathematical model addresses our research question by conforming again that when applied force increase, so does acceleration.  when looking at two other sources, we observed more linear relationships between hanging mass and acceleration. one group had a mathematical model of $y=5.0147 x - 0.0318$. although this model is not the same, it is very close to what we observed from our data. according to the second groupâ€™s data we looked at, they obtained a mathematical model of $y=0.527 x - 0.1088$. both of these results support our groups claims because they show that when acceleration increases, applied force does as well. also, both of their experimental model show a linear positive relationship between hanging mass and acceleration. 

the experimental and theoretical models compared very well together. from the theoretical model of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, we know that applied force and acceleration have a direct correlation with each other and we were also able to see this in our experimental model as well. forces that may be present in the experimental model are normal force, friction from track, and air resistance. these forces show up in the experimental model in our uncertainty values. the mass of the system shows in our experimental model in our final acceleration. we took the slope of our graph in figure 1 and divided that value by the mass of the system to obtain our acceleration. the non-massless string did not affect the uniform acceleration of the cart because since it is massless, there was no additional force added by the string. one systematic error that could have been present in this experiment is resistance on the air track. this error could cause inconsistent acceleration measurements causing data to not be accurate. a way to prevent this error from happening is to make sure that the air track is clear and functioning currently. some constraints that could limit the generalization of our results are air resistance and friction on the track. since we cannot control these things, these constraints will cause variability in results.
