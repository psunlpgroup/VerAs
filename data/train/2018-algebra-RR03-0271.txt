conclusion:
	What impacts the time it takes a pendulum to swing one period?
	There is no correlation between weight on the pendulum and the time it takes for the pendulum to swing one time. 
	There is a correlation between the length of the string and the time it takes the pendulum to complete one full swing.
There is no correlation between the angle of release and the time it takes the pendulum to complete one full swing.
Occurs due to flaws with equipment and flaws with the execution of the experiment
 Having a separate person time and drop the pendulum
Measuring the length of the string from the top to the top of the hook for the weight
 Reaction times when timing the period of the pendulum
 Discrepancies with times from different people timing 
Angle of release not being exact because of movement
Having the same person that releases the pendulum time the period
 Taking a video of the pendulum and using the timing from the video
 Repeating the experiment more times would reduce the effects of error
 More accurate equipment would also reduce error
 The standard deviation tells how serious and what type of errors occurred most frequently.
 This also allows us to add error bars to our graphs to account for the errors that did occur.
