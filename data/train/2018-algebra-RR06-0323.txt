research question: how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes? 

based on the data that we collected the hanging weight does affect the acceleration of the system. based on the graph the relationship between the hanging weight, which represents the force of gravity in newtons, and the acceleration of the system have a positive linear relationship. since we cannot draw a horizontal line between all the points which means that there is a linear relationship between the points. this means that as the force of gravity on the hanging weight increases the acceleration of the system increases as well. we can also make this conclusion confidently because the error bars are small which means that the data collected from the data studio has a very low uncertainty. this conclusion also supports our hypothesis and our prediction. we predicted that the variables would have a linear relationship. 
group 4 had a slightly different hypothesis, they stated that as the mass changes then the applied force also changes. but they did have the same prediction that the force and acceleration would have a linear relationship. the results they got from the experiment were also like ours, so they also were able to conclude that as the force increases the acceleration increases as well. and their mathematical model was also very close to ours which supports the statement that our data is very close. i do not see any discrepancies in their data and their claim. 
the theoretical model for this experiment is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, which was provided. the experimental mathematical model we got was,  $a=c1  w+ c2$. and using our data the mathematical model that we got was $y=5.1828 x-0.0578$. this equation is based on the linear slope equation, $y=m x+b$. this means that $a=c1  w+ c2$ is a linear function.  c1 is equal to the f/msys, and c2 is equal to fext/msys from the enhanced theoretical equation. the reciprocal of c1 should also be the system mass. when we did this calculation, we got 0.193 kg and our measured mass was 0.1785 kg, which is very close to the theoretical mass.  
the enhanced theoretical equation is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. this model follows the same format as the theoretical model of  $a= \frac{f}{m_{sys}}$, however the external force is included in the equation. then based off the mathematical model that we got $\frac{f}{m_{sys}}=5.1828$ and $\frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}= -0.0578$. the external forces that could be acting on the system include the friction, and if the track is unlevel. to account for this external force you multiply c2 by the system mass. for our data we calculated the external force to account for 1/10 of a n. 

if a heavier string was connecting the hanging weight and the cart, then the acceleration would be greater because the heavier string would need to be accounted for in the system mass. this heavier string would cause more gravity to act on the system because the force of gravity on the system is equal to the mass multiplied by 9.80. and based off the conclusion that as the force of gravity increases then the acceleration would increase, this would indicate that as the string gets heavier the force would increase causing the acceleration to increase. 

some random errors that could have occurred would be measurement errors. when measuring the mass of the system an error that could have occurred was if the balance was not calibrated correctly, this would skew the data. the uncertainty value which accounts for error is ±0.05. if the mass of the system is overestimated, then the acceleration would be increased. on the other hand, if the mass is underestimated then the mass would be underestimated. another random error could be with the acceleration measurement. the data studio is relatively accurate, so this error is minimal, but it can still occur. the uncertainty we got for the acceleration is ± 0.001. if there is error this would skew the data, which would result in making inaccurate conclusions. to reduce random error is to collect data for a large amount of trials and then average it. some systematic errors that could occur is the unknown external force on the system. if friction is the force this would reduce the acceleration. then if the track is not level it would depend on if the track slopes up or down, if it slopes up this would reduce acceleration, however if it slopes down it would increase the acceleration. 

there were a few constraints in this experiment. one constraint is the string had to be weightless, because we based the calculations off the fact that the string weight is negligible. another constraint is that the track had to be level because we based our data off the fact that the track is on level ground. so, if either of these are changed then the data cannot be used to generalize the research question.
