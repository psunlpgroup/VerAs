discussion and conclusion

	the purpose of this lab is to see how the acceleration of a system change when applied force changes. the mathematical relationship between acceleration and applied force would be linear. they both have a dependent relationship with each other. the two groups experiments also support our findings, as you can see looking at the pictures of their experimental models. the theoretical model,  $f=m_{sys} a$, and the experimental model, $a=c1 w+c2$, relate by both having the mass of the system and the hanging force in it. some other forces present would be gravitational force on the hanging mass that needs to be considered in the theoretical model. also, there is friction, but that should be held constant throughout the experiment. the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model with c1*w, which is 1/m and w is the hanging force. so the mass of the cart and the mass of the balls hanging, would be considered the total mass of the system. the acceleration would stay constant because the mass will stay constant throughout the trials. a possible systematic error would be messing up the calculation of the mass of balls as the balls were increasing. so not measuring each ball, but instead using the mass of on ball for all of them. this would be a little off because not all of the balls are the same mass. that could be prevented by measuring each ball instead of just one. a constraint used in this lab was the number of balls hanging from the cart. we couldnâ€™t go past that number or the acceleration would be faster than we wanted.
