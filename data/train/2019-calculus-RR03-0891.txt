Creating Mathematical Models
In the third experiment we ask if there was a mathematical model that represents the relationship between how long the pendulum is and the period of the pendulum. We hypothesize that there and that is our prediction as well. We stated that the independent variable was how long the string was and the dependent was the period of the pendulum. the control variable was what angle we released the pendulum, which was 45 degrees. The other control variable was the how much the pendulum weighted, which was 50 g. We had an uncertainty of 0.001 because that was the value of the photogate. Based on the graph below we can answer our research question, if there was a mathematical model that represents the relationship between how long the pendulum is and the period of the pendulum, because there is a power relationship. We used to excel to determine the mathematical model. 0.9998 was the R^2 value, which is very good. The formula for the pendulum is  $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$.The mathematical model we found does support this equation, this is because if the length was 0.9 m and using 90 cm for the equation we get 1.90 s and that is fairly accurate we the 0.001 uncertainty.
