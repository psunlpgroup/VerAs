Discussions and Conclusion 

 The purpose of this lab was to determine the mathematical models, which described the real behavior in our system that compared acceleration and force in lab 5. The purpose of lab 6 was to develop an understanding of other factors that affect the system and to develop a mathematical model for each.
 In these three experiments we were testing how different variables affect the acceleration of a system. We did this by having the mass of the hanging weight as the independent variable in the first experiment. This was then graphed against the acceleration of the system, the acceleration was found by graphing the speed of the system and then finding the derivative of the equation. The mathematical model for the first model is $a=26.798 F + 0.0048$ (see figure 1). The 26.798 represents 1/kg. The error bars for the first model are too small to be seen, as the standard deviation was less than .001 for the data collected. This small standard deviation tells us that the data collected is accurate to the point that the conclusion that mass and acceleration and positively correlated can be made. In the second model, the mass of the cart was increased and the mass of the hanging object was kept the same. The mathematical model for this experiment is $a=\frac{0.1339}{x^{0.97}}$ the .1339 represents F (see figure 2). The error bars are too small to be seen in this graph, the relationship was also found by taking the derivative of the model of the speed and plotting this (the acceleration) against force. The relationship between increased mass of the cart and the acceleration was a negative correlation. For lab period 6 we tested how the forward tilt of the track affected the acceleration. The independent variable was the tilt of the track and the mass of the system was a constant. We found as the tilt increased by .25 inch increments the acceleration also consistently increased as well. The error bars are too small to be seen in these graphs. The C2 values were increasing so this indicated to us that the acceleration was increasing because the physical meaning of this value is F. The physical meaning of the C1 value is 1/kg (see figures 3,4, and 5). 
The models above tested the affects of friction and of forward tilt respectively. For the first group, their model claimed that as friction increased the acceleration decreased. For the second group, their model claimed that as the tilt increased the acceleration increased. These two claims help us to understand how outside forces has an affect on the acceleration of a system. The first group’s claim indicates that friction and acceleration have a negative correlation this does not support or refute our claim because they are testing a different variable. It does, however, suggest that other outside forces do in fact affect the acceleration of a system. The second group’s claim indicates that forward tilt and acceleration have a positive correlation. These models help us understand that C2 is 1/kg and the C2 is F/m. The theoretical equation for a single force is $a=\frac{f}{m}$
 If the mass of the string were to be increased then the mass of the system would increase which would decrease the acceleration of the system because  $F=m a$ which can be manipulated to $\frac{f}{m}=a$. Having the larger number on the bottom of the equation makes the acceleration smaller. 
 A random error could have been a slight difference in the starting spot of the cart. Having the same spot each time at a solid number of one meter reduced this error. Another error could have been in the weighing of the cart and the bobs, this would be random error. To reduce this error the same person weighed the bobs and measured the weight multiple times, this error is harder to fix because we were using a triple beam balance. There is systematic error in the measurement of the acceleration of the system; this is due to the computer system so we cannot fix this error. 
 There was time constraint, which limited the number of trials we could perform. If we could have performed more trials then we would have more accurate data. Another constraint was the amount of materials we had. If we had more weights then we could have tested more variations of the independent variable. If we would have had more of the square blocks that allowed us to tilt the air track then we could have tested more variations of this independent variable as well. 
 The two equations are an interpretation of $F=m a$. In the first model C1 represents 1/kg and C2 is force (F). When you find the reciprocal of the C1 value you get the mass so then when you add the two forces together you get the sum of the forces. Therefore, $C1 + C2 = F_{net}$ .
