conclusion:

throughout this lab we explored at first how mass is relating to acceleration, and we learned how the mass of 2 and the system do affect the acceleration. after learning this, we decided to test for another hypothesis in lab 2 as to see how the tilt of the ramp affects the acceleration and force. throughout four different tests, we proved our hypothesis that the higher the tilt, the more the object accelerates and the higher the force of the cart. we determined our answers from graphing and seeing how the variables relate, using our previous knowledge of newtonâ€™s laws of motion, and reworking the laws to work how we wanted.
