discussion and conclusion

	throughout the experiment, the scientists were trying to answer a research question. what would affect the time taken for a period of a pendulum swing? with that question in mind, they set up an experiment that would test three different independent variables and plot the difference in data. the first experiment was with a changing angle of release and constants for the other two variables, length and weight. as seen in figure one and table one, the data seems somewhat similar. because of the overlapping vertical error bars on the lowest and highest values, it can be concluded that there was not a statistical difference in the data and that the period was not changing during the experiment. some variation in data may be due to random error in time taking with a stopwatch. to lower the random error, two people were taking the time at once and averaged their values to get a mean value of time. this supported the hypothesis and prediction of the experiment. the second experiment was with a changing string length and constants for the other variables. as seen in figure two and table two, the data seems to have a positive correlation with the increasing string length. because the vertical error bars are not overlapping at almost all points, very few look too close to judge, it can be concluded that there was statistical difference between the trials of increasing string length. with increasing string length, the time taken for the period to complete also increased. random error in this experiment may have been present in the measuring of the string due to the lack of an accurate system. this supported the hypothesis and also the prediction due to the positive correlation. on the third experiment, the independent variable was a changing mass of the bob, while the other two were controlled. as seen in figure three and table three, the data seems to not be correlated. like the results in the changing angle of release, the error bars are overlapping on all of the points. it can then be concluded that there is not a correlation between changing mass of the bob and the period of the pendulum. random error in time taking with a stopwatch (may be too early or too late from actual value). this experiment also supported the hypothesis and prediction because it was not one of the predicting variables to have an effect. 

	there was a forth experiment done with the only variable to change the period, the string length. the data plotted was similar looking on the graph to the earlier second experiment with string as well. with a photogate being used, this lowered that change of random error substantially to just the measurement of the string, given that the photogate was being used properly. as seen in figure four and table four, the data was plotted with a best fit line and an equation was given from the power line. the equation was compared to the theoretical text book equation, which after inserting some variables comes out to equal $y=0.2 x^{0.5}$. the equation given by excel equaled     $y=0.194 x^{0.5}$              which is considerably close to the actual. the data collected supports the theoretical equation.

	in the experiment, there were some possible random errors described in each individual experiment. reducing those errors were attempted by a series of examples. for time, we tried to use two stopwatches to average the time collected. for the string length we had two different people check and agree on a length to make sure it was centered with the body of mass. and with the weight, each individual bob section was re-weighted even though it has a mass amount inscribed. systematic errors are possible but unlikely with this experiment given the parameters of the controlled variables. a constraint that would possibly lead to a systematic error is the pendulum apparatus. it only allows accurate results from a small angle of release and would not provide exceptional data if the angle of release was tested at large angles.
