conclusion

           that these variables don’t affect the period.  using the theoretical mathematical model we 

           were able to support our claims.  we were able to do this because weight and angle of 

           drop isn’t accounted for in the formula.  length of string did appear to affect the period of        

           a pendulum.  we were able to confirm this because length is l in the formula.

   

      d.) in our experiment we could have experienced both types of error.  we experienced 

            random error through measuring our drop angle with a protractor trying to retest while 

            collecting data.  another random error was human error from using the stopwatches.  we 

            reduced the drop angle error by using a protractor.  we reduced the human error by using 

            a photogate.  both changes resulted in much better data.  we may have experienced 

            systematic error if the scale used to weigh our object was off or the photogate was off, to 

            our knowledge neither tool was incorrect.  a way to check for systematic error would be 

            using these tools to measure something you already know, for example money (all u.s. 

            bills weigh 1 gram). 



       e.) we were not given any constraints.  from other groups i heard a possible constraint could 

             be to only test angles below 30 degrees.  i learned this post lab three, so during our lab  

             we were not given any constraints.
