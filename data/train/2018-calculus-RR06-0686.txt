discussion/conclusion:

	the purpose of this lab was to determine how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force acting on the system changes.  after graphing the data points and their uncertainty we were able to find a line of best fit for our collected data.  the equation for our line of best fit is $y=0.04815 x - 0.14$ with an r2 value of 0.9891.  our r2 value is close to one but could have been better.  with the equation mentioned above and by referring to graph 01 you can see that the line of best fit is a linear line with a negative y intercept. by using these factors, we can assume that the relationship between the force applied and the acceleration of a system is a direct linear proportion, so as one goes up the other goes up by the same factor.  this makes sense because the theoretical mathematical model is $f=m a$ with f being the applied force and a being the acceleration. this mathematical model agrees with ours and has a direct linear proportion between f and a.  
	both groups referenced above have very similar equations for their line of best fit as our group has.  they also have great r2 values which are closer to one than ours, so i’d like to give them credit for such precise data points and measurements.  additionally, their hypothesis and control variables are basically identical to ours which means we all had a good understanding of what we were looking for and what we were going to use to find it.  in conclusion both groups decided that the force applied and acceleration were directly proportional based on their graphs and equations for the lines of best fit. the only difference was that group half beard had a positive y-intercept while our group (nog) and group no clue, group had a negative one. 
	as mentioned previously our experimental model followed the form of a straight line with the equation $y=0.04815 x - 0.14$.  with rearranging this equation, it can be formatted to mirror the theoretical formula $f=m a$ or in terms of acceleration, $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$.  the y in our equation is the acceleration or (a) and the x refers to the f applied.  this leaves us with the coefficient which must be related to 1/msys.  also, the y-intercept accounts for the forces acting on the system that are unknown divided by the mass of the system as well.  thus, the enhanced theoretical equation is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$  this theoretical equation can be paralleled to our model with $a=\frac{x+ error_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$.  by using what we observed in the experiment and the models/formulas we calculated, we can evaluate different scenarios.  for example, if the hanging mass were to be connected to the cart with a heavy string then the line of best fit would not have been linear.  this is because the cart would have to hold the weight of the string which is changing over time based on how much string is over the edge of the table.  the weight would change based on the position of the system and thus creating the applied force to become an integral over time not a constant one.  since the applied force would be changing the acceleration would be changing as well.  as time were to go on the magnitude of the acceleration would increase and $f=m a$ would not be able to simply be used to solve for a.

	just like any experiment random and systematic errors are prevalent.  some random errors include external forces acting on the cart or suspended mass.  these could be air flow, air resistance, or incorrect measurements/human error.  systematic errors such as a non-level air track, friction on the air track or pulley system, imperfections with the air track air flow, an uncalibrated triple beam balance, or even a flawed rotary motion sensor must be considered as well.  the errors can be reduced with multiple trials and with checking the equipment before use to make sure they are calibrated correctly.  another simple way to make sure error is limited is to watch and make sure nothing noticeable goes wrong with each test such as a not fluid motion or a disturbance in the system.  we also faced constraints in this experiment which included such things like we weren’t in a perfectly closed system so external forces could act on the system and impact the experiment and data. also, the type of devices we used could always be improved.  there was no way to check if the air track was completely level or to know if friction between the track and cart was present.  due to the fact the experiment wasn’t conducted to the best of its abilities, it can’t be used perfectly to determine acceleration based on force but can be used to make the assumption force does affect the acceleration of a system.
