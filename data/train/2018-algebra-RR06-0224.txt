discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of this lab is to find the relationship between acceleration and force and how changing one affects the other. to explore this research question, a car was put on a frictionless track a string was attached to the car and threaded over a pully. mass was attached to the end of the string in the form of fishing bobbers, equal number of bobbers were added to the car to keep the mass equal. when the vacuum is turned on in the track the car begins to accelerate due to the force created by the mass at the end of the string being accelerated downward by the force of gravity. by changing the bobbers attached to the end of the string, different masses created a different force on the car and the acceleration was measured during each different mass. table 1 depicts the different masses and the force they had on the car. this force was calculated by multiplying the acceleration due to gravity 9.8 m/s2 by the mass at the end of the string. plotted in figure 1 is the calculated force of the different masses versus the acceleration of the car. the line of best fit shows a positive linear relationship for most of the points except for the fourth point that should the acceleration of 0. this point had a error with the data studio recording the acceleration, but also we as a group accepted it as true because we were confused thinking that the masses on the car and hanging from the string being equal created equal forces on the car giving it a constant velocity which is why the acceleration is 0. but this is incorrect because the car starts from rest and begins to move it has to acceleration. but the equation for the line of best fit is $a= 4.346 f -0.1698$. 



	this group named the uncertainties found a positive linear relationship between acceleration and force which can be seen in their graph in the lower left-hand corner. this agrees completely with the relationship our group found. their mathematical model was $a = 4.2973 f +0.0102$ which is close to our model $a= 4.346 f -0.1698$. however, our y intercept differs drastically but that is most likely due to the fourth data mentioned above with an incorrect acceleration which skewed the model.

	this group named 77.5 found a positive linear relationship between acceleration and force as well. this agrees completely with the relationship our group found. their mathematical model was $a = 0.0042 f  -0.0221$ which a very small value multiplied to the force than compared to our model their y intercept differs drastically as well that is most likely due to the fourth data mentioned above with an incorrect acceleration which skewed the model.

	the theoretical model simplified that is stated in newtonâ€™s 2nd law is $f=m a$, specifically for this experiment it would be $a =\frac{f}{m}$. in this case it would be $a =\frac{f_{hang} +F_{unknown}}{total mass}$. our experimental model $a= 4.346 f -0.1698$ is very close to the theoretical model. 4.346 is equal to 1/total mass, force is equal to the force of the hanging mass and the -0.1698 is equal to force unknown /total mass. the unknown force that is present in the experimental model could be caused by the track that car was placed on not being perfectly level, causing the car to accelerate due to gravity not only the hanging mass. it could as be some amount of friction between the cart and the track. or it could be that the acceleration due to gravity was assumed 9.8 m/s2 but changes slightly due to elevation so the calculated force could be incorrect. the mass of the string was also not taken into account when calculating the acceleration, but it does change the mass of the system and would affect the acceleration according to the mathematical model. possible errors in the experiment could faults in data studio measuring the acceleration of the car this could be fixed by using the most updated version of the software so the measurement is the most accurate. another error could be the placement of the car on the track was slightly different for each trial this places another factor into the experiment so mass it not the only variable changing. this can be fixed by using machine of some sort to set the car in the same spot each time or maybe using pieces of tape to make sure its in the exact same spot each time. constraints in the experiment could be the slightly different masses of each of the bobbers given different calculated forces which could be incorrect if one assumes the bobbers were all the same mass or the bobbers were mixed up. the slight change in mass could given a incorrect force which would change the acceleration.
