conclusion:

After stating the hypothesis for the experiment, the theoretical model was applied. We compared the graph from the two prior labs and the relationship DV and IV with this lab, and we observed that the DV and IV continue to be linear based on the theoretical model. By trying to compare the relationship numerically between the theoretical model and our mathematical model, we observed that our mathematical model was different. Theoretical model being base 0.201 and exponent 0.5. We obtain a base of .4756 and an exponent of 0.2722 varying very different from the theoretical model. Then, by using the theoretical and mathematical model for theory of the pendulum we tried to predict the period of a length of 50cm. The mathematical model we got was a third of the theoretical model with mathematical being 1.2659 and the theoretical being 3.17. Even though, the results obtained were not what it was expected, having the theoretical model, the group conclude that is was due to random error since all the measurement were taken correctly. Also, it can be concluded that the length of the string has a positive correlation between the length of the string and the time it took. Hence, If the length of the pendulum is longer it would go slower and if the length is shorter then is faster; this can be observed on graph 1 and the data collected above.
