Discussion: 
The purpose of the lab is to see how the force affects the acceleration of the cart.  The acceleration as we saw increased in a linear fashion as force increases.  The mathematical model addresses the research question.  
Experimental is  $a=0.1919 x+2E^{-05}$
Theoretical Model is  $a=\frac{9.8-f_f}{0.174}$
Our Experimental was found by taking the graphs 1 equation. The slope is low because we did not change grams to kilograms.  So it should be around 5.  In lab six we used this equation to find the correct force to make the acceleration go to .6m/s^2.  
Theses two groups agree with our claim that increased force will have increased acceleration. Also have similar mathematical models if we changed ours to kilograms.  To compare our theoretical model and experiment model we found the equation to graph one and for theoretical we know that $F=M A$ so we broke it down farther in to $a=\frac{f_g-f_f}{m_s}$. The force outside of the hanging weight on the cart is friction and air residence.  But we just put it in with the y intercept.  The mass of the system shows up in the slope because the slope is rise over run. And the y-axis is acceleration but the X-axis is force, which is mass of the system timeâ€™s gravity.  A nonmass less string would affect the system by adding weight so it would have a great force pulling down on it.  By making force go up so would the speed.  Some errors present in our solution was not measuring the cart right and it be off for the whole system making it a systematic error.  Some random errors are the table being slanted, air resistance, knots in the string.   To reduce them we factor out the air resistance, we also could make sure the track/table is even.  We also run more trials to make it closer to the mean, and make error lower.  Some constraints in this lab were the length of the string, how much weight we could add was only eight boppers.  Only one type of string and cart was a constraint.
