discussion and conclusion

the question that we were trying to answer in this lab was what dependent variables change the period of a pendulum. to answer this question, we took measurements using the three different independent variables that we thought could change the period. the first independent variable that we tested was mass.

the mass of the bob that is attached to the string of the pendulum was the first variable that we changed. this means that the independent variable (iv) was the mass of the bob which ranged from 50g to 150g  and the dependent variable (dv) was the period length. this part of the experiment also had controlled variables which were the length of the pendulum (30cm) and the angle of release (30 degrees). when we first looked at the data it seemed that there might be a slight downward trend in the correlation between mass and the period of the pendulum. this made us believe that the more mass there was, the shorter the period would be. however, this idea was changed when we inserted error bars into our graph and looked at the data in a more accurate way. we had a large standard deviation (.205) and this meant that the original conclusion could be tainted by errors. the standard deviation is also what the error bars are based on and mean that the data could be off by + or - .205 seconds. the errors that led to this standard deviation could include random errors such as timing errors, errors in the length of the pendulum, and an error in the measurement of the angle. there also might have been systematic errors such as the weights used being incorrectly measured, the tape measure being off, or the protractor being incorrect. once we look at the data with the error bars, we could clearly see that there was no meaningful correlation between the mass of the bob and the period of the pendulum. this conclusion is also supported mathematically due to newton's second law $f=ma$. the more mass there is in the equation the more force there is, however, the acceleration stays the same. this shows that the mass does not change the acceleration, and thus the period of the pendulum.

the second iv that we looked at was the angle of release which ranged from 5 degrees to 60 degrees. this means that the dv was again the period of the pendulum. this data, however, is different from the rest of the lab because my lab group was not the group that collected the data. the group that collected the data was group 1 in phys 2001l-007 19ss on an unknown date. this, however, did not change the way that we looked at the data and drew conclusions about it. the controlled variables in this data were the length of the pendulum (59 cm) and the mass of the bob (90 g). when we looked at the overall data from group 1 in phys 2001l-007 19ss we added error bars with the same standard deviation (.205) as we had in our mass measurements to the graph assuming that they made the same errors, and thus they has the same sized error bars. using this data we saw that there was at first no meaningful correlation between the angle of release and the period, however, when you reach approximately 50 degrees there is an upward trend which means that the larger the angle of release the larger the period.  

the last variable that we tested was the overall length of the pendulum. this made the independent variable the length of the pendulum which ranged from .25 m to 3.52 m and was measured from the center of the bob to the top of the stand. the dependent variable was the period of the pendulum. the controlled variables of this experiment are the mass of the bob (150g) and the angle of release (15 degrees). before we looked at the data of this experiment, we added the error bars to the graph. the error bars, however, are negligible due to us using a very precise measuring device called a photogate. this device uses a laser to tell when the pendulum breaks a plane, then records the time that it takes to reach that plane again. with this device our standard deviation was .001. this small of a standard deviation means that error bars would be + or - .001 seconds. with this data, we could easily see an upward trend in the correlation between the length of the pendulum and the period. this is also seen in the line of best fit. this line was made using a power series equation. we were confident in this equation due to the accuracy of our data. the equation for the line of best fit that we made was 2.0305x^.4905. to test how accurate our equation was we ran several calculations against a theoretical equation ( 2pisqrt(l/g). with this found that our equation gave very similar answers to the theoretical equation as our calculations were only off by a few hundredths…

example of calculation

the theoretical math model  $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$            says that if you had a length of .50 meters, you would have a period of 1.42 seconds. the equation that we made in class (2.0305l^.4905) would say that the time of a .50-meter pendulum would be 1.45 seconds. this is a difference is .03 seconds. this is a difference that is very minimal and would only be truly seen with an extreme length.

… which shows that the measurements that we made in class were very close to perfect condition models. taking all this data into consideration, we can clearly see that there is a positive correlation between the length of the pendulum and the period, where the longer the length the longer the period.

in conclusion, the only variable out of the three that we tested that we can confidently say impacted the period of the pendulum is the length of the pendulum. this is seen not only with the equation that we made but also by the graph. the mass has no correlation when you look at the data, we obtained due to the standard deviation of .205 that we have to take into account. the angle could be argued to have a correlation; however, we were constrained to a small data set and could not make a confident conclusion.
