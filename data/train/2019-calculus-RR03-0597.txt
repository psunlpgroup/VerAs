conclusion:
Once we finished gathering our data for this final part of the experiment, we added the best-fit trendline, which then gave us our mathematical model for the period of a pendulum. We then had to find the theoretical model of the period which can be seen below is 


Once the theoretical model is known, we had to find if the mathematical model that we came up with can either support the theoretical model or not support it. In order to do this, we are going to have to do some plugging in of our data points to see if our outputted periods are relatively close to each other. I’ve decided to just plug in our 1st data point, which has a length of 41.6 cm. Now, when plugging this value in, I have to be careful with my units of measurements, mainly because the theoretical model uses the normal SI units, which means length must be in terms of meters and not centimeters. So, when plugging in .416 meters for L, and 9.8 for g, our outputted period is 1.29 seconds. Now, when plugging our length into my mathematical model, we keep it in centimeters due to the fact my equation is based around the notion that length is in centimeters. So, when I plug 41.6 cm into x, my outputted period is 1.28 seconds. When comparing our 2 values, I’m pretty sure it is safe to say that my model supports the theoretical model for the period of a pendulum. Some random errors can account for why the values are not exactly the same, and these errors could’ve included but are not limited to different people doing different jobs throughout the experiment, or a tape measure breaking and having to get a new one or measuring the length from different centers of mass. Some constraints that we have for this experiment include using the type of tape measure we did, or having a limited amount of weight.
