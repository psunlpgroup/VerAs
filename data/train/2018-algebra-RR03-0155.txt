discussion & conclusion

	the overall research question tested in the labs was “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?” the direct answer to that question from experimentation is length impacts the period of a pendulum. as the length of a pendulum is increased, the period is increased. this relationship is displayed in both figures 3 and 4. in figure 3, the error bars do not overlap in each length change, indicating that the data is significant enough to support the hypothesis. likewise, in figure 4, 99.94% of the data fits the trendline and shows that increasing length increases the period. the mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is . this is consistent with the data shown in figure 4. 

	through experimentation in labs 1-2, changing the weight or angle had no effect on the period when error was factored in. in both figures 1 and 2, the error bars overlap, indicating the data was not significant enough to support the hypothesis in each factor. 

	there must have been errors in labs 1 and 2 since the standard deviation was so high. one possible error expressed in those labs was independent variables’ data was too close together or not enough data was taken. this would have been a random error. this could be corrected by taking more data and spreading out the independent variables. another possible error was that the stopwatch could have been off or miscalculated due to human error. this would have been a systematic error. to correct this, a photogate could have been used in labs 1-2 to account for the human error/miscalculation.
