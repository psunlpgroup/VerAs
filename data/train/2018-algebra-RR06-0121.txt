discussion and conclusion

	in these two labs regarding newtonâ€™s laws, the purpose was to determine if there was an effect of the acceleration of the system due to the different force applied and if there was a relationship between the variables. this was done by using an air track, a cart, fishing floats, string, and pulley. the string attached the fishing floats and the cart and strung though the pulley. the floats weighed 0.005 kg and the mass of the cart was 0.1886 kg. each trail an additional float was added. the was done until all eight floats were used and the velocity was measured using the data studio program. the uncertainty of the acceleration was given to use through the data studio program and the uncertain of the mass was given on the balance scale. 

	after the data was collected and a graph was created. the experimental model was $a=4.2102 f + 0.056$ or $y = c1 x + c2$. with this resulting mathematical model, we can say that there is a positive, linear relationship between the force applied and acceleration of the system. the graph shows this as well because of positive, straight, and upwards slope. after the whiteboard presentations, we found that one group found a relationship between applied force and acceleration of a system, while controlling the mass of the system and the distance of the track. their data showed a positive, linear relationship between the two studied factors (group 1., 2018). another group found that a change in the applied force of a system resulted in a change in the system of acceleration. their data also showed the same positive, linear relationship that every group found (group 2., 2018). this groups kept the mass of the system controlled throughout the experiment. with these groups that found the same positive, linear relationship as we did, which supported our claim.

	the experimental model was a liner relationship of $y = c1 x + c2$ and with c1 equivalent to 1/masssys and the c2 equal to 1/masssys + friction. even though an air track was used to reduce frictional force, there was still a frictional force on the track, friction in the pulley, and air resistance; these forces are included in the constants. due to these constants, the experimental model is not similar to the theoretical model of $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$  because it does not include the external forces and is used to assume that there is no air resistance. however, the enhanced theoretical model, $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, is a better match to the experimental model because of the inclusion of external forces. the uniform acceleration of the cart could have been affected by a non-massless string by decreasing the acceleration because $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$  and by adding the mass to the system you have a larger mass causing the acceleration to be lower. 

	some random errors that occurred in the experiment are incorrectly measuring the mass of the cart and floats, environmental factors such as air resistance, friction on track and pulley, and mass of string. by correctly measuring the mass of the cart and floats and double checking with a second person can help reduce the chance of random error. also, the environmental factors can be reduced by making sure is no huge movement of wind (such as a window open), making sure the air track is pushing enough air out and that track is clean and has no tape and that there is nothing on the pulley. by making sure to include the mass of the string in the system, the acceleration can remain close its actual value. with these actions, we can help reduce the overall random errors occurring the experiment. a systematic error that could have occurred was that table not being leveled. this would have affected the calibration of the balance scale. to reduce this error, we can simply make sure the table is leveled using a leveler. 

	in this experiment, the biggest constraint was the given time. we only had two hours to complete the lab which caused us to only run a small number of trials which was 9 trials. due to the reduction in the number of trials, the generalization would have been broad because we only based the conclusion and claim based off of 9 trials. another time constraint that contributed to the experiment was the number of floats given. we were only given 8 floats causing a smaller number of trials which causes in the generalization to be much broader. 

	even though there was a lot of errors and the constraints placed on the lab, we were able to see a positive, linear relationship between the force applied and the acceleration of the system. this was supported by the claims made by two other groups in the lab section.
