conclusion and discussion

the figure above is the relationship between acceleration and applied force due to the hanging mass. as shown above the trendline is linear which means there is a direct relationship between acceleration and applied force. again, this supports the hypothesis and the prediction stated earlier. as the hanging weight increases the acceleration increases linearly. this is because the theoretical equation for newton’s second law is $f=m a$.  it was also concluded that the acceleration does not depend on the travel distance of the mass. the horizontal error bars on the graph are so small that they are barely seen because the systematic error is small, which is a good thing. the vertical bars are so small they are not seen on the graph. since the bars are very small/ too small to be seen, it can be concluded that if the hanging mass changes the acceleration will change as well. but there are still error bars shown, so some systematic error could be from the air not being distributed properly resulting in a small amount of friction and possibly from the device recording not being calibrated properly.  some random errors could be from estimating the mass from the balance and calculation errors when calculating the acceleration.  

	the experimental equation is $y=4.7231 x - 0.012$ which came from the equation of the best fit line from the graph of applied force vs. acceleration from figure 2 above. where y is acceleration (m/s2) and x is applied force (n). the theoretical equation is $f=m a$,  $a=\frac{f}{m}$,  $a=\frac{f_{hanging}+f_{unknown}}{m_{sys}}$  the mass of the system is hidden in the slope of the experimental equation -> (1/msystem) is 4.7231 which makes the mass of the system  m_system is 0.2117. this value is very close to the measured mass of the system which is 0.187.  other forces than the hanging weight that might be present could be air resistance and friction between the cart and the track. these forces are c2 in the equation above. if the string on the cart had a mass big enough to make a difference then there would not be uniform acceleration because when the hanging mass gets closer to the ground the string lengthens which means more mass is affected by gravity.  in order to minimize these errors, the balance and the recording device could be calibrated before the lab starts, make sure the air is being distributed properly, and recheck acceleration calculations for any errors.   some constraints could be dependent on the air force to shut out the friction completely. if there isn’t enough air blowing it could change the results by a lot. another limitation could be having to weigh fishing bobbers instead of getting an exact mass.  this adds random error whereas if a 10g weight was given then there wouldn’t be a calculated uncertainty.  overall, the hypothesis stated above is  the acceleration is related to the applied force is correct and proven in this lab.
