conclusion:

the physical feature of the lab setting the force of friction between the cart and the air track represented the numerical value c2 from our mathematical model from lab 5. as the number of magnets increased (increase in force of friction) so did the c2 value and because of this the acceleration decreased. as the number of magnets decreased (decrease in force of friction) so did the c2 value and because of this the acceleration increased.
the purpose of lab 5 is to investigate and develop a mathematical model for the relation between the force of gravity on the acceleration of the system. then based off the mathematical model found in lab 5, lab 6’s purpose is to investigate and determine which numerical value c1 or c2 in the mathematical model ($y = c1 x – c2$) is affected by the force of friction on the system and how this value ends up affecting the acceleration.
the mathematical model from lab 5 is produced by x being the independent variable which is the gravitational force on the system, y being the dependent variable which is the acceleration of the system. this can be seen from graph 1 above because on our x-axis is the force of gravity and on the y-axis is the acceleration of the system. this mathematical model is very similar to the rearranging of the theoretical model from newton’s second law; $f=m_{system} a$. when rearranged it looks like this, $a =\frac{f}{m_{system}}$. this is very similar to our mathematical problem from lab 5 that has the form, $y = c1 x - c2$. because the c1 value is a decimal it means that our mathematical model actually looks like, $y =\frac{x}{c1} -c2$ if you take out the c2 you have $y =\frac{x}{c1}$  which is identical to $a =\frac{f}{m_{system}}$. which means c1 must represent the mass of the system. then through doing lab 6 we found that c2 represents in the force of friction on the system. which is shown in the mathematical models for each number of magnets which was explained further in the conclusion for lab 6. 
lab group 3 did the same experiment as us with the friction force being caused by magnets. there table and conclusion show that as they increased the magnets, which increases the force of friction, the acceleration of the system decreases. this means that their c2 value mostly increased with the increase in magnets because their mathematical model from the scientific research community part of lab 6 records is -

$y = 0.0298 x – 0.0146$
$y = 0.0028 x – 0.0164$

because of the similarity in the equations, the only thing that can decrease y which is the acceleration of the system is c2 and as said above when they increased force of friction the acceleration of the system decreased meaning that their force of friction affects their c2 value as well. the reason the c1 values are off is because our system had a greater mass. 
lab group 4 did a different experiment to test for what numerical value is affected by force of friction. they tested force of friction with the elevation/tilt of the track. which when the elevation/tilt increases then force of friction decreases. as they said in their conclusion that as they increased tilt, which decreases the force of friction, their c2 value decreases. that is the same way that our and lab group 3’s c2 value from our mathematical models were affected. which also shows and helps backup our claim that the c2 value is affected by the force of friction. 
there really was not much error in this lab besides systematic error with the measuring of the mass of the bobs and/ or the measuring of the mass of the cart. because when you compare our values of acceleration from lab 5 to values from the theoretical equation, every time our value is less than the theoretical.
this means that there was a systematic error with measuring the mass of the bobs and they have more mass than we measured or there was random error with measuring the mass of the cart and it has less mass than we measured.
the only constraint in these labs were time. we were not given enough time to fully complete lab 05/ experiment 2 and come up with an accurate conclusion and mathematical model for it.

our mathematical model is consistent with the equation from newton’s second law because when rearranged the equation looks like  $a= \frac{f}{m_{system}}$ which is very similar to our mathematical model which is $a =\frac{f}{c1} -c2$. f is the force from gravity, a is the acceleration, c1 is the mass of the system and c2 is from friction. to account for a friction force in newtons second law equation, the friction force would be subtracted from the forces causing the motion of the system which all together is . and in our mathematical model c2 is subtracting from the force of gravity over mass of the system which is like subtracting friction force from the forces causing the motion.
