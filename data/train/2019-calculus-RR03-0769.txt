discussion and conclusion:

what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings? there are several factors that can contribute to the period of a pendulum, including the length of the string, mass, and angle of release. according to lab 1, you can see that each independent variable had either a positive or negative correlation on the period of the pendulum. in experiment a, the string length had a positive correlation with respect to the period of the pendulum. in experiment b, the mass had a negative correlation with the period of the pendulum. however, during lab 2 we discovered that only the string length directly impacts the period of the pendulum. this was determined by discovering the different random and systematic errors that caused the data with the mass and the angle to display incorrect results.  the inaccurate weights of the pendulum and the slight change in the drop angle made a systematic errors for the experiment. these caused the results to inaccurate of the intended result. these errors were reduced by weighing the weight for verification and taping the protractor for accurate measurements.

the theoretical mathematical model is represented in the lab 3 graph above, this model shows that the data moves in an logarithmic path. the data is well represented because as the length increased, the time increased in a quick by almost rounded path. there were also several restraints that could have effected the results, these include materials available and time allowed for the experiment. we were given limited materials for the experiment and that could have affected the results of our experiments. the following data and conclusions presented above clearly answer the question proposed earlier on what effects the period of a pendulum.
