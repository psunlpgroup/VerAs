conclusion:
The purpose of this lab was to find out what kind of relationship the acceleration of a system has with the force applied as it is changed throughout the experiment. The mathematical model, which was given by the TA, turned out to be relative to the experiment. The slope of the linear fit above is 5.014 as the mass of the system turned out to be 5.328. The mass of the system was found by dividing 1 by the total mass calculated (0.1877kg). In part II of this experiment, an acceleration was given, and the force applied had to be found. With constraint of what objects could be used for the hanging mass, the bobbers and paperclips, our group could not get the exact mass needed to meet the acceleration given. The acceleration given was 0.584m/s2, as the acceleration collected through experimentation was 0.566m/s2. (A picture of both the theoretical equation and the enhanced theoretical equation will be uploaded with this document) Another force that could have been present in this experiment is friction. If a non-massless string was connecting the hanging mass to the cart, it would still have uniform acceleration because the mass of the system would still be the same. (Findings of two other groups will be submitted with this document) The results that other groups collected support our groupâ€™s claim. Each group had gotten a negative external force. A systematic error that both us and other groups had realized were whether the measuring tools had been calibrated correctly. A random error could have possibly been a slight push or pull on the cart as it was released during each trial. A constraint that was present in this experiment was the total number of bobbers used throughout each trial to keep the mass of the system equal. In conclusion, as the force applied increased, the acceleration increased, and the relationship between these two variables is linear.
