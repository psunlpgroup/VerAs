conclusion:
The mass, angle of release, and length of the string are not the only properties of a pendulum but they are the ones most likely to have an impact on the period. In theory increasing the mass will increase the force gravity exerts on the system, changing the angle changes the distance the pendulum has to swing to reach the center, and changing the length has the same effect as changing the angle. When we went to test all these factors we saw that only one of our factors, string length, actually had an effect on the period. You can tell this by looking at our graphs for all three and see that only one has points that don’t overlap in the error bars.
	We came up with the model        $y=0.2876 x^{0.4295}$          (where y is period and x is length of the string). With some algebra our model looks like the theoretical model which is is       $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$             (T is period, l is length, and g is 9.80 m/s2) 
It is worth noting that mass and angle of release do not have a place in this equation and that is because they don’t have an effect on the period.
	In the first experiments we had a copious amount of random error with out time measurements because the method we used to take the time was reliant entirely on reaction time of one person. In terms of systematic error there wasn’t much due to the simple nature of the experiment. When we found our variable that effected period we used a photogate to measure tome and it was much more precise and accurate. We only tested these variables on small swings which mean that it doesn’t apply to pendulums with angles over 20 degrees.
