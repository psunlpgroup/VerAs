discussion and conclusion

the purpose of this lab is to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system (lab 05) as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model (lab 06). referring to figure 1 above, the mathematical model after graphing acceleration versus mass of cart is $y=0.138 x - 0.969$ where y is acceleration (m/s2) and x is mass of cart (kg). referring to figure 2 above, the mathematical model after graphing acceleration versus applied force is $y = 2.92 x – 0.0216$, where y is acceleration (m/s2) and x is force applied (n). referring to figure 3 above, the mathematical model after graphing acceleration versus force of gravity is $y = 0.53 x + 0.00729$, where y is acceleration (m/s2) and x is force of gravity (n) when 0 magnets are on each side of the cart. referring to figure 4 above, the mathematical model after graphing acceleration versus force of gravity is $y = 0.616x - 0.0137$, where y is acceleration (m/s2) and x is force of gravity (n) when 1 magnet is on each side of the cart. referring to figure 5 above, the mathematical model after graphing acceleration versus force of gravity is $y = 0.676 x - 0.0528$, where y is acceleration (m/s2) and x is force of gravity (n) when 2 magnets are on each side of the cart. all mathematical models were determined by setting a trendline through the data of each graph, and this equation shows the relationship between the two variables of each. the negative exponent in figure 1’s model shows the inverse relationship between the mass of object 1 and acceleration, and the constant is the relationship between acceleration and 1/(mass of object 1). the positive coefficient in figure 2’s model shows the direct relationship between force of gravity on object 2 and acceleration where the coefficient equals 1/(mass of system), and the negative constant is caused by friction reducing acceleration (it’s friction force/mass of system). the positive coefficient in models from figure 3-5 show the positive correlation between the force of gravity and acceleration where the coefficient is 1/(mass of system). the coefficient should decrease as magnets are added since the retarding force makes the normal force more and therefore the mass appears to get larger, so some error is present in our data. the constant on the model of figure 3-5 becomes more negative as more magnets are added. this is because the constant is (force of friction/mass of system), so the force of friction becomes larger in magnitude and is negative, therefore this makes sense. 

although different units were used and therefore different magnitudes were obtained by group 1, the data can still be compared. their coefficient decreased, which was predicted above since the coefficient is 1/(mass of system) and the mass will appear to get larger due to increasing normal force caused by the magnets. however, both their constant and ours decreases as magnets are added. because of our coefficient’s deviation from group 1’s data and the expected result, the confidence in our data’s accuracy is reduced. 


group 3 and 4 tested the effect of an incline on the cart’s acceleration by observing the backwards tilt. the leading coefficient increases as the added height increases, but the y-intercept decreases as the height increases. this makes sense since the coefficient is 1/mass of system and as the tilt is increased, the normal force decreases, and mass appears to decrease and the negative constant is friction/mass of system so as the tilt increases, the lower normal force gives a lower friction force. this supports the overall impact that gravity has on the systems tested and that it causes the acceleration. the impact of added height in their experiment was not as drastic as the impact of added magnets in our experiment. the iv in this model had less of an effect on the numerical values since the coefficients were smaller than ours.



all our data except for the coefficients of models 3-5 made sense. therefore, the only source of suspect error comes from this part of the experiment. a possible source of error that explains this is that the magnetic field generated between the magnets was not constant, the magnets may have had a net upwards force on the cart, reducing normal force and making mass appear to decrease. using a track that utilizes actual friction on a cart instead of mimicking it through magnets will reduce this error as then the normal force will remain the same (on a level track of course). a small error can be deduced from a positive friction value in figure 3’s model. this is likely due to some slight forward force through a tilted track. making sure the track is level in the future would reduce this slight error. 



many assumptions were made and therefore the experiment was very restricted in what it can claim. we assumed is  negligible string mass, negligible friction between string and pulley, and that the coefficient of friction is constant throughout the track. therefore, the results can only be claimed for situations with the parameters above, this is not very generalizable. 



the meanings of each variable are explained above. in each model, the units of y is m/s2 and therefore the units of the other side of the equation must also be m/s2. using newton’s second law, the units of each variable can be determined. for example, figure 2’s model is  $y = 2.92 x – 0.0216$, where y is acceleration (m/s2) and x is force applied (n). i need units for acceleration on both sides (m/s2). since $f=m a$, then $a=\frac{f}{m}$. since x has units of force, then i know the coefficient must have units of 1/m (kg-1) so that $\frac{f}{m}=a$. then the constant must have units of acceleration, so i knew that it has units of f/m (m/s2) since $\frac{f}{m}=a$. this process was used for all variables in each model.
