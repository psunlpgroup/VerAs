conclusion:

the goal of this lab was to find what impacts the period of a pendulum? the first few experiments helped us narrow down what would be the likely candidates to have some effect on the pendulum. during experiment 3 we were able to refine our data collection on the factors that we already had data showing a correlation, to verify if there was one. we claimed angle and length of the pendulum would affect the period, but our data showed otherwise. if you refer to, and compare, figure 1 and figure 2, it shows that only the length appears to be a factor in the period. it’s trendline fits with a much larger r value than that of our angle graph. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of a pendulum is       $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$           so our data from figure 2 would go along with this. this model uses length in the determining the period, while also not using angle (or mass, which we ruled that out and so did not investigate). the only variables in the model is period, length, and gravity. so therefore, length and gravity are the effecting factors on period. there were almost certainly errors in our methods. we know this because of the relatively large differences in our equation, compared to the models numbered equation $t=1.99 x^{0.5}$. if we were able to do this lab again, we would like to have a more accurate way of releasing the pendulum from a specific angle. the method we have currently, aligning the angle by eye, which is prone to having random human error due to the measurer’s perspective or depth of the string. maybe a mechanism that pulled the pendulum to a certain angle would work better than a human’s judgement. we were constrained by what we were supplied with in the lab. with experiment 3 we were allocated a precise method of time recording with the stop gate, but were only supplied a protractor for measuring angle. this was also all done in a classroom setting which could possibly affect results but is unlikely to be more constraining then the fact that is was performed by college students.
