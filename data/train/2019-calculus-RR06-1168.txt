conclusion:
	the goal of this experiment was to test the hypothesis that a positive, linear relationship exists between acceleration and applied force. conducting the experiment as described earlier proved our hypothesis to be true. after all data was collected microsoft excel was used to conduct curve fitting, the relationship was found to be to be $a=0.0029 f_{applied}$. this is a positive, linear relationship. as illustrated by error bars and uncertainty values discussed previously, acceleration and applied force are not perfectly equivalent. furthermore, outliers can clearly be seen in graph one. the size of the error bars seems to be proportional to the magnitude of measurements, indicating that as acceleration and applied force rise, they become less equivalent. all other groups in the laboratory both predicted and produced similar results. all relationships were found to be positive and linear. the accepted theoretical equation for the relationship between force and mass is $a=\frac{f}{m_{total}}$. our results support the theoretical model in that in both cases, acceleration and applied force have a positive, linear relationship. the slope of graph one is the inverse of the cart’s mass, which makes these equations reducible to identical expressions. our results also support the enhanced equation, $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$. the extra forces in this equation are shown by the error bars of graph one. the extra forces are the cause of those “errors”. 

	in this experiment, the string was assumed to be negligible. however, this is not necessarily the case. if a heavy string were to connect the cart to the weights, the acceleration values would be less accurate. as the string fell, the mass above the pulley would be added to the mass applying the force. this would result in a nonlinear representation of velocity with respect to time. acceleration would have to be averaged, whereas the instantaneous rate of change would be constant with a light string. 

the errors that affected our results were entirely non-human. almost all measurements, curve fitting, and mathematical calculations were done by computers. the only human measurement made using a triple beam balance with a smallest increment of one gram. velocity vs time models were also subject to error. the measured intervals of velocity were assumed to be perfectly linear but were not. the models generated were based on an average acceleration value.

	this experiment was not only affected by random errors, but by constraints as well. among these constraints was the relatively small range of values that was tested. as the values increased, so did the error bars which leads me to believe that further testing of greater values would reveal a different, more accurate, mathematical relationship. our model becomes less accurate as parameters increase. this makes generalization of the results inaccurate.
