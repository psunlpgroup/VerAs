conclusion:

the purpose of these labs was to find the factors that influence the acceleration of a hanging mass system in a theoretically frictionless environment. we were able to then find models to find if the factors do affect acceleration, as seen in figure 1 and 2.
for lab 06, the models of other groups (group 1 and group 6, respectively) worked along the same general line as our own models from both labs. they had both include positive linear association. 
there was plenty of room for errors and room for some other factors that we cannot test. we are working in a theoretically frictionless environment, so we are unable to tell if air resistance or friction has an actual role. in our current lab setting, this could have issues, but we’re unable to test for them. any other errors could be due to a misunderstanding of the lab that we’re currently unaware of. other errors could be due to systematic errors with the machine. we do not know how to tell if the machine is calibrated, so we’ve done all labs assuming that it is reading correctly.
our model is to solve for acceleration, so [$a =\frac{f}{m}$]. this works for both our models, so for our model from lab 05. [$a = 0.029 f - 0.0228$]. the y-intercept should theoretically be 0, but it is not due to errors in taking data or caused by the lab environment. the .029 should be close to 1/mass. for lab 06 our first incline had an equation of [$a = 0.0288 f+0.0314$]. this equation is very similar to our lab 05 model, but with slightly different numbers due to errors and an incline that was put upon the track.
