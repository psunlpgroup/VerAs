conclusion:

	the point of the experiment was to find out what affects the period of a pendulum swinging. in each of the three experiments performed, each variable was changed and tested to see if the period would change. between mass, angle, and length, only length had an effect on the period. length was the only variable with a strong correlation that could be seen. the error bars on the mass vs time and angle vs time graphs demonstrated that the values could easily be the same. the theoretical mathematical model for the period of the pendulum is $y =1.99 x^{0.5}$. our formula was very close to this, being $y=1.5$. something included in the theoretical model is gravity, which we did not account for. gravity’s impact on the experiment may be one reason why our formulas do not match up. as our values are not perfect, that may also explain why our formulas are not exactly the same due to our mass vs time and angle vs time graphs not being straight horizontal lines. potential systematic errors could be the protractor, measuring tape, and stop watch having their own error margins. a way to fix this in a future experiment would be to use more accurate instruments. potential random error could be accidentally starting the stopwatch too late or early or giving the pendulum some force when releasing it to complete its period. a way to fix these errors would be to have a machine execute the experiment – it would have sensors to start the stopwatch exactly when the pendulum finishes its period and it would not give the pendulum initial force. because all we were given were stopwatches, measuring tape, and a protractor, it was easy to make random error and therefore the results found are not as accurate as they could be.
