conclusion:

	my lab team and i have concluded that neither mass nor angle does affect the length of a pendulum’s period. the only variable tested that affect the length of the period was the length of the pendulum itself. supposing that the actual values could lie anywhere in the scope of the error bars in figures 1, 2, and 3, our conclusion is the same. the plotted points and their error bars in figures 2 and 3 do not display any kind of trend. however, the plotted in figure 1 could lie anywhere within their respective error bars and there would still be a discernable relationship present. as length increases, the time of the period does as well. the theoretical model for a pendulum’s period length is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$ with l being length and g being acceleration due to gravity. our mathematical model was linear, but the positive relationship between length and period length is present in both. angle and mass are excluded from both as well. 

	the errors that affected this experiment are almost all human in origin. a protractor was used to determine the starting angle every time, meaning that a human had to “eyeball” the angle. the timing of the period was done by a human in earlier trials, however this error was fixed by using a sensor to time the pendulum in later trials. length was also “eyeballed” by a human with a tape measure. these errors could be eliminated by using exclusively automated measuring tools. air currents could also have affected the results. this could be dealt with using engineering controls to minimize air currents.

	the conclusions drawn from this expirament are heavily affected by constraints. we were able to gather only very small amounts of data and this is the largest contributing factor to the inaccuracy of our original mathematical model. we were also unable to test gravity as a variable, which is crucial in determining the length of the pendulum’s period.
