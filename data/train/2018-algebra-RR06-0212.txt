conclusion:
The following experiment was conducted on 10/3/18 and 9/6/18 by Cameron Kennedy, Megan Henry, Matthew O’Hare and, Taylor Glosner between the hours of 2 and 4 is 30pm. Other contributions can be seen in our references. We set out to determine if there was a relationship between force and acceleration. We hypothesized that a change in force would result in a change in acceleration if all other variables remained constant. Furthermore, we predicted that a change in force would increase acceleration. We designed an experiment to test this in which a cart on a near frictionless air track would be pulled with varying force by hanging weight attached to a string at the end of the track. As the hanging weight descended the string would move turning a pulley which would measure our acceleration. While the hanging weight would vary the total weight of the system was held as a constant in order to not throw off our results. Our independent variable was force imposed by the hanging weight which was changed incrementally. Our dependent variable was acceleration which was measured to determine if a relationship did exist. This was recorded by the rate at which the string moved the pulley at the end of our track. Finally, our control variables included mass of the system weight was shifted to either the cart or the hanging weight but never added or removed from the system so mass could be treated as constant of 173.4 grams. Data was then recorded in the manner described above recorded and graphed the results of which can be seen in figures 1-2.
We set out with the intent of determining if acceleration was linked to force. We hypothesized that these variables would be linked and designed an experiment to test this. In this experiment we used an effectively frictionless cart and string weighing a total of 173.4 grams. The weight attached to the string was hung over a ledge in order to create a force that would pull on the cart, accelerating it. The amount of weight on the string relative to the weight of the cart changed however, the system mass never deviated from 173.4 grams. This allowed us to test how acceleration was linked to force. Our data as displayed in Figure 2 clearly shows a relationship between acceleration and force. Our data shows a steady increase of acceleration of predictable magnitude as force increased. Our data was fit with a linear regression line with an R^2 value of 0.996 meaning our data adhered extremely well to a linear pattern. This line has an equation of $y=7.4026 x + 0.035$ where y is acceleration measured in meters per second squared and x is force in Newtons. While, not an exact mathematical model of the relationship our line could then be used as an approximation of the phenomena we observed. Given our low error rates (seen in Figure 1) and tight adherence line we predicted that we could rely on our results with a fair amount of confidence. However, in the interest of verifying reproducibility our experiment was repeated by 2 other groups in order to see if they attained the same results. Group 2 in our lab section conducted a similar experiment to ours with a different constant weight producing the equation $y=4.7453 x + 0.077$ where y is acceleration measured in meters per second squared and x is force in Newtons (Group 2, 2018). Similarly group 3 conducted the experiment and produced the equation $y=5.5209 x - 0.051$ where y is acceleration measured in meters per second squared and x is force in Newtons. (Group 3, 2018). Both groups used the same independent and dependent variables as us and while they also held mass as a constant their system weights differed from our own. The equations created by the two other groups seem like our own in structure and values with some variation, likely caused by different system weights and systematic errors in experimental setup. Their results generally seem to support ours. And looking at all three equations they generally follow the pattern $a=\frac{1}{m} f + f_{friction}$ (near 0) or $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$. We can from this general equation refine a more exact theoretical equation which is $a = \frac{f}{m_{sys}} +\frac{f_{external}}{m_{sys}}$. The equation we produced seems to vary from this formula by a greater extent than our peers however our regression line fits our data extremely well leaving us to conclude our experiment may have had increased systematic error due to inaccurate measurement tools or improperly setup equipment. Our random error seems to be fairly low as we don’t see much variance outside our line and it fit regression exceedingly well (data was not very noisy).  To remedy this, we could retake measurements more carefully as well as examine and swap out some of our equipment to make sure everything is functioning as it should. Our results and the results of our peers are generally applicable to the real-world phenomena however, unsurprisingly we all failed to reproduce the exact mathematical model of force and acceleration.  This is a common short coming of this kind of experiment though, because production of a perfect experimental model is no simple task. If we were to repeat this experiment with a heavy string rather than one of little weight it would likely produce somewhat similar results as the weight of each individual component is less important than that of the whole system. However, unlike our setup as the cart travelled more of the string would go over the edge and its weight would be added to the hanging weight. This steadily added hanging weight would steadily increase the force imposed on the cart meaning the cart would accelerate more and more as the experiment went on.
