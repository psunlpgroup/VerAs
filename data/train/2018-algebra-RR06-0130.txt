discussion and conclusion 

	in this lab, it was tested whether the applied force had a relation with acceleration, relating to newton’s laws. in experiment 05, the system mass was chosen to be the control variable. the system mass in total consisted of the cart, and eight bobbers, and the mass was 188.9 grams. this system mass was able to be split and changed in any proportional between the hanging mass and the cart mass. in table 2, run 1 was done with a single bobber for the hanging mass, while run 8 was done with eight bobbers for the hanging mass. the dependent variable in this experiment was the acceleration, which was based off of the independent variable, force. in table 1, we had predicted that there would be a direct correlation between acceleration and force. based off our results and figure 1, our data had concluded that there was a positive, linear relationship between the two variables. 

the resulting mathematical model from our graph had come out to $y=17.609 x + 0.0113$ (shown in figure 1). this model does support out direct relationship prediction, yet there may have been some errors in our conversions for the slope to be so high in number. based off of the uncertainties’’ data in figure 2, their relationship between force and acceleration had come out to be $y=4.2973 x + 0.1012$. the monkey’s data, shown in figure 3, had a mathematical model of $y=0.0043 x + 0.0555$. these groups’ data does support our prediction of a positive, direct correlation between force and acceleration. however, all three sets of data have a different slope, which must be due to human error. 

	our graph in figure 1 relates to the mathematical model because if the mass is staying the same, and the force is increasing, then the acceleration must increase based off newton’s second law ($a=\frac{f_{hanging} + f_{unknown}}{m_{system}}$. the slope of the graph is equal to the inverse of the mass, while x is equal to the force, and the y-intercept is funknown/msystem. a non-massless string connecting the hanging mass to the cart might affect uniform acceleration of the cart because the mass of the string would affect the system mass. as the hanging mass begins to acceleration downward, more mass would be added onto the hanging mass due to the string, which would affect acceleration and cause it to increase. 

	some errors that could have affected the experiment were some environmental factors, such as friction on the air track, air resistance, and the level of the air track. some random errors could have been mis-weighing the cart and bobbers, and not converting the units correctly. system errors of this experiment could be an issue with the rotary motion detector, or an incorrect balance. to reduce these errors, the air track could be leveled, masses could be measured on multiple balances, and the math could have been double checked by multiple lab partners.
