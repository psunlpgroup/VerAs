conclusion:

	when it comes to whether mass, angle of drop, and length of a pendulum swing have an affect on the period swing time, there are very conclusive results obtained from this lab. mass has no correlation to the swing time, however, angle and length of pendulum both have an effect, both with positive correlations. as shown by the graphs above with their error bars, and the experiment done with almost no uncertainty, it is safe to conclude that the results are accurate in portraying this information. most of the points lie within the error bars for most of the graphs, except for the angle graph, which has relatively high error bars and values. in experiments 1 and 2, there was a random error due to the inconsistencies with the time measurement. this is why experiment 3 was conducted, experiment 3 did not have the random error of time as a device with little uncertainty was used. for our angle of drop the equation  would work for all angles less than 30 degrees. when it comes to the length graph though, the curve would be a power function, which shows slightly in the graph above. a constraint that could make it difficult to recreate this lab was the use of a photogate. this was the device used in experiment 3 to accurately measure the time of each swing.
