discussion and conclusion

the acceleration of the system can be effected by changing the force applied to the system. this was accomplished through changing the hanging mass. an experimental model was determined (graph 1) and then used to find the force required make the acceleration of the system 0.425 m/s^2 (table 2). the system tested to get the acceleration of 0.425 m/s^2 needed to have a hanging mass of 9.84 g since the overall mass of the system remained constant but a cart with a bigger mass (296 g) was used. the equation $0.425= \frac{9.8  m_{hanging}}{296+{m_{hanging}}+ 0.1097$ was used to find the value 9.84 g for mhanging.

	increasing the hanging weight increases the applied force. when the hanging weight was increased, the acceleration of the system increased (graph 1). tests from two other groups supported this data. although their experimental models differed slightly from $y=0.004 x+0.1097$ they both had the same positive linear trend. the physics phour group had an experimental model of $y=0.005 x-0.0563$. the two women group had an experimental model of $y =0.0053 x-0.0443$. both of these models support the data since they both have positive slopes close to 0.005 and y-intercepts close to zero.

	the theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by a single force is $f=m_{system} a$. the enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by more than one force is $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$.  the experimental model of $y=0.004 x+0.1097$ with an r^2 value of 0.9757 supports both of these equations since it has a positive slope and the y-intercept is close to zero. in the experimental model y is acceleration and x is force applied due to hanging mass. this x value is determined by multiplying the hanging mass by 9.8 m/s^2. the reason that these models differ is because there is some friction acting on the system in the experimental model. the track that the acceleration is measured on may not be perfectly level either which would cause a difference in the models.

	the string having a significant heavier weight would have an effect on the experimental model. it would make the acceleration not linear. once more of the string was hanging off of the track, the acceleration would increase exponentially instead of linearly since more weight would pull the cart forward. the theoretical model does not take the mass of the string into account but the experimental model does.	

random errors could have included the precision of the scale to weigh the masses of the cart and bobs. this error was reduced by trying to get the lines on the scale to match up exactly as the different objects were weighed. if the measured mass of the hanging mass was measured to be higher than it actually was, then the acceleration would be lower than the expected value. other error could have come from selecting too big of a portion of the velocity vs. time graph to measure acceleration. this error was reduced by attempting to include only the portion of the velocity vs. time graphs that looked like they had a constant positive slope. if too much of the graph was selected, the acceleration measurement would be too low.

	constraints within the experiment included time. the sixth trial to find acceleration due to the force applied appeared slightly inaccurate so it could have been retested if more time was available (graph 1). another constraint was that only a certain number of bobs could attach to the cart. if more mass could have been tested, more trials of measuring acceleration could have been performed which would make the experimental model even more accurate.
