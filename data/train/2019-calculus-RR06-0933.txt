discussion

in these two labs, the purpose was to develop mathematical models to describe the behavior of an applied force and the resulting acceleration. it was as well to develop an understanding of each variable in the models and their numerical values. we obtained the models found in graphs 1, 2, and 3 by collecting data through experimentation then plotting it in excel. from there we could obtain an equation for each line. for graph 1, lab five experiment 1, there is  a positive correlation between the force applied and the acceleration yielding a positive linear equation. for graph 2, lab 6 experiment 1, there is the same positive linear correlation, however as the angle increased the acceleration would increase as well. for graph 3, lab 5 experiment 2, there is an exponential negative correlation this is because as the mass increased it would accelerate less. we also observed the data of other groups. in picture 1, group 4’s hypothesis, data and conclusions matched ours. however, in picture 2, group 5 had a different hypothesis that they tested. theirs tested friction while ours tested tilt angle. both experiments however, measured their effect on the acceleration of the cart. they concluded that the greater the friction the less acceleration that cart would experience. we on the other hand concluded that as the angle of the track increased the acceleration would increase. error in our experiments could be from inaccurate mass measurements or error could have also came from the very small amount of friction the sled had on the track. to prevent this in the future we could use a higher grade sled with even less friction. constraints could include the equipment used, with better equipment we could take more accurate data. another constraint would be that we couldn’t test very large masses. our two models follow newtons 2nd law, $f=ma$ as they are positive linear equations that have direct correlations.
