discussion and conclusion

the purpose of performing theses three experiments is to obtain a mathematical model of the situation. this will allow us to mathematically predict outcomes by observing trends. the basic model we follow if the trend is linear is $a= c1 f+ c2$. once we find what c1 and c2 are we can find out how they are affected. 

all three experiments were done on a frictionless air track. the cart was attached to a string that hung off the side of the track with a weight (bobbers). as the weight fell, it turned a wheel that measured acceleration. after collecting the accelerations and the force applied by the weight a graph was made with a trendline to act as the mathematical model.  looking at the force vs. acceleration graphs (lab05 experiment one or labo6) we can see that the relationship was linear following the $a= c1 f+ c2$ model. because we are solving for acceleration we know, by newtons second law, that $f=m a$ or $a=\frac{f}{m}$. so, the units for c1 are 1/kg and c2 m/s/s. physically c1 is the invers of the systems mass. looking at the equation from the force vs. acceleration experiment from lab05 we can take the invers of c1 (2.806) and get 0.356 kg. this is close to our measured value of 0.34011 kg. c2 physically is the acceleration lost to friction. however, there does not seem to be any correlation between c2 on any of the force vs. acceleration models. this is probably due to random error and or systematic error. i believe it to be systematic because there is a major difference between lab05 (0.0093) and lab06 (0.0473,0.1883,0.0417). lab05 was done on a different day from lab06.   

looking at the data from groups 3, who was testing to see how tilting the track up affects acceleration, and data from group 5 who was testing to see how tilting the trach down effects acceleration, we can further confirm our understanding of c2. by looking at group 3’s equations, we see that c2 is negative. if c2 is acceleration lost this would make sense because its now fighting gravity when it moves down the track. we can also see that c2 is also increasing with height.  it’s the opposite with group 5’s equations because they are tilted down and the cart is accelerating with gravity, and that’s why c2 is positive. c2 still increasing with the height the only difference is the sign. 

some random errors could have happened during the experiments. the string that was used in the experiment had some knots which could interfere with the constant applied force. to reduce this double check to see of the string is knot-free. systematic errors could have come from the analytical balance or the device that measured acceleration. these measuring tools can be calibrated for accuracy. the magnets that were used where very weak and can apply different strengths. to reduce this error, make sure that all of the magnets are the same strength.

 the findings from this experiment are slightly limited as it was performed on an air track with magnets to apply a greater friction force.  the tests were also done with small objects. for example, the cart is not even a kg, and the art only accelerated one meter before stopping. if performed at a bigger scale we might find a limit or that there is something else happening as the forces become large. 

we can further justify our understanding of the constants based on newtons second law, . our mathematical models follow the form $a= c1 f- c2$. we can change this to solve for f, $f=\frac{a+c2}{c1}$ (a+ c2)/ c1. in order for units to cancel properly c2 must be in m/s/s and c1 in 1/kg.
