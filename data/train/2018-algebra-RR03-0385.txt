discussion and conclusions

	the question trying to be addressed in performing this experiment is to try to find the variable or variables that affect the period of a pendulum. there were three different variables that were tested because these variables were able to be controlled or adjusted during this experiment. it was predicted that the increased amount of mass would shorten the period. after analyzing the data, it was found that there was no correlation between the amount of mass on the object and the time of the period. looking at fig. 1, the data seemed to be consistently even throughout changing the independent variable. when error bars were added, a horizontal line could be drawn through all bars, meaning there is no significant data to prove correlation, disproving the hypothesis. when it came to the angle of release and the period of the pendulum, it was predicted that an increase in the angle will lead to a longer time of period. it was found that there was no correlation between the angle of release and the period. the data in fig. 3 seemed to have a slight positive trend, but when the error bars were added, a horizontal line could be drawn threw all data meaning there is no significant data to prove correlation, disproving the hypothesis.

	when looking at the relationship between the length of the string and the period of a pendulum, it was predicted that as the length increased, the time of the period would increase as well. after data analysis, fig. 2 shows that there was a positive trend that is significant enough to prove correlation. because it was believed that the length of the string did affect the length of the period and supported our hypothesis, it was decided that the experiment would be repeated using a photogate, which would enable more accurate data collection. when looking at fig. 4, it was found that there was a positive correlation that was significant enough. after data analysis, it was originally thought that it was a linear relationship, but in fact the relationship between the length of the string and the time of the period is an exponential one. the data best fit a trend line represented by       $y=\sqrt{x}$          the given model for the pendulum is         $t=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$         the model created with the data was       $y=0.2714 x^{0.444}$          the coefficient in front of x should be close to 2. calculations were done to find the reason for the miscalculation, and it was found that the calculations used centimeters and not meters. when the data is changed to meters from centimeters, the results ended up close to 2. 

	when it came to the first three experiments when the photogate was not used, there were a few random and systematic errors. some random errors included human errors like the variation in the angle of release and changing the length of the string. those errors could be changed by measuring the angles and length of the string between each trial. another form of human error can come with the reaction time of the people. the systematic error can come from the watch itself. both the reaction time and the systematic error with the watch was both solved in part two of length vs. period by using the photogate. overall, the question that was put forward at the beginning of the experiment was answered, being that the length does affect the time of the period of a pendulum exponentially.
