conclusion:
	While completing both labs, there were research questions associated with both. In Lab 05, the research question asked about whether the redistribution of mass in the system affects the acceleration. Clearly, this question was answered and is a ‘yes’. As mass was increased/decreased the acceleration did change. In Lab 06, the research question was asking if the tilt of the air track changes, then does the acceleration change? The answer is yes to that also and is proven by Graph 2. When the hanging weight was the independent variable, the weight was increased by the number of bobs being added, and this showed a decrease in acceleration as more weight was applied. In Graph 1, the graph doesn’t show error bars due to the error value being so low.  

	This picture is from Lab 06 and is from Group 6, their data does show backwards tilt, it is like our equations that were found. Based on their equations, they had a positive correlation between change in tilt and acceleration. This was the same result we got except our tilt was forward.

	This picture is also from Lab 06 and is from Group 2. Their data was based on affecting the friction of the air track and how it affects acceleration. After reading their data, it is shown that different friction levels affect the acceleration.
	The theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system by a single force is 2.8986x + 4e-16. Graph 2 (from Lab 06) represents this equation visually by showing acceleration vs force. This graph supports the theoretical equation. If a heavy string connects the weight and the cart, the force wouldn’t be completely transferred to the cart and this would cause a lower acceleration because of less force being applied. From Lab 05, the only error that could have occurred was the air track having an uncertainty of 0.001. But from Lab 06, there was no error found as our R-value of Graph 2 equaled out to 1. The constraints that were set on both of these labs were time.
