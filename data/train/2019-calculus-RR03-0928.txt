conclusion:

	in experiment one, we concluded that the period of a pendulum is not affected by the mass of the pendulum bob. we determined this by noticing that the error bars overlap on the y-axis, meaning that the line of best fit could be horizontal, meaning the period doesn’t change. 

	in experiment 2, we concluded that the length of string had a positive affect on the period of the pendulum. this was determined by the graph’s error bars not overlapping at any y-values, and the overall trend having a positive slope.

	in experiment 3, we concluded that the angle of release had no affect on the period of the pendulum in the bounds of less than 20 degrees release angle. this is evident on our graph by all error bars in the limited range overlap on the y-axis.

	in experiment 4, we calculated the mathematical model of the period of a pendulum using the equation of the line of best fit from the graph of experiment 4. we got $y=2.0171 x^{0.5019}$ as our mathamatical model, with a r2 value of .9999. this model matched well with other groups that were performing the same experiment.

	random errors for experiment 1-3 were reduced by using multiple timers for each trial. these readings were averaged together to create a more accurate measurement. in experiment 4, random errors were negated completely by the use of a photogate to record the period.
