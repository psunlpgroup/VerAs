discussion and conclusion 

      the purpose of the lab was to determine how the acceleration of a system changes when the applied force changes. based on the results of the experiment, acceleration and applied force have a positive linear relationship. this is evident in table 3 and figure 1. these show that as the mass/ “applied force” increased, the acceleration of the system increased in a linear fashion. this is demonstrated in the experimental mathematical model $y=4.8734 x + 0.0198$. the data from the findings of group 3 and group 2, as seen in figures 3 and 4, support our findings. their data also represents a positive and linear relationship between force and acceleration.

      the experimental model was linear $f=4.8734 a + 0.0198$ compared to the theoretical model $a=\frac{f_{hanging}}{m_t} +\frac{f_{unknown}{m_t}}$. (1/m total)  is  (1/ 0.0294 kg + 0.140 kg) is equal to 5.90. this value represents the value of 4.8734 in the experimental model. other forces present in the experimental contexts may include the friction from the string on the pulley, friction from the air pushing up on the cart from the track, and air resistance from the movement of the cart. using $f_{hanging}=m a$ of the theoretical model, the mass of the system shows up in the experimental model because you would be able to determine the total mass from 4.8734 is (1/total mass). this would result in a total mass of .205kg, which was .065kg off from the actual mass of the cart (which was .140kg), which can be attributed to error in the experiment. 

       if the string had appreciable mass, then the cart would not undergo uniform acceleration, because the string mass holding the balls would increase as the string lowered, continuously influencing the acceleration differently. possible systematic errors could be a balance that is improperly calibrated or the sensor on the precision air track being improperly calibrated. the friction attributed to moving objects poses limitations to the generalizability of the results. increasing the hanging mass of the system would most likely require a stronger string to support. a stronger string may result in an increase in the mass of the string. an increase in mass would influence the acceleration differently, therefore limiting the generalizability of the results.
