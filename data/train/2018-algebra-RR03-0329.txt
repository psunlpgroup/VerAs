discussion and conclusion

through the course of this experiment, we were able to test our research question, “what impacts the period of a pendulum for small swings?” and come to a definite conclusion. the first independent variable we tested was the length of the string. the experimental design plan is shown in table 1, and it includes our dependent variable, the length of the period, which was the same for all our experiments as well as the control variables. for this experiment, the control variables were the mass, which we kept constant, and the angle of release, which was also kept constant. the data for this is shown in table 4 as well as in figure 1. as it is shown, there is a correlation between longer string length and a longer period. the trendline has an r^2 value of 0.9999. from this we can conclude that the length of the string does have a significant effect on the period length. this conclusion is consistent with the theoretical mathematical model. the theoretical mathematical model once we rearrange the variables a little bit becomes is  $t=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}}$. the simplified theoretical equation was 2.006 * l^(0.5), which was exactly what our experimental equation was, as it is shown on the graph in figure 1.

the next independent variable that was tested was the mass of the pendulum. the experimental design plan is shown in table 2, and it includes the dependent variable, which was the length of the period, and the control variables. the control variables for this experiment were the angle of release and the length of the string. the data for this is shown in table 5 as well as in figure 2. the data in table 5 for the average period in seconds is very similar as it ranges between 1.40 seconds and 1.47 seconds. this then translates to an almost completely horizontal line on the graph, which can be seen in figure 2. based on this, we can conclude that changing the mass has no effect on the length of the period for the pendulum. the theoretical mathematical model once we rearrange the variables a little bit becomes is  $t=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}}$. the simplified theoretical equation was 2.006 * l^(0.5), and this was not consistent with the experimental model we derived from this experiment, which can also be found on the graph in figure 2.

the last independent variable that was tested was the angle of release of the pendulum. the experimental design plan is shown in table 3, and it includes the control variables and the dependent variable, which was the length of the period. the control variables for this experiment were the length of the string and the mass of the pendulum. the data for this is shown in table 6 as well as in figure 3. the data in table 6 for the average period in seconds is once again very similar regardless of the change in angle. this is also reflected in figure 3. the graph shows an almost horizontal trendline, implying that there is no correlation between the angle of release and the period. based on this, we can conclude that changing the angle of release of the pendulum has no effect on the period length for the pendulum. the theoretical mathematical model once we rearrange the variables a little bit becomes is  $t=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}}$. the simplified theoretical equation was 2.006 * l^(0.5), and this was not consistent with the experimental model we derived from this experiment, which can also be found on the graph in figure 3.
