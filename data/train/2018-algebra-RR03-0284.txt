conclusion



to conclude this experiment the hypothesis and predictions were correct that mass, length and angle have an impact on the period of the pendulum and it was determined that there was no correlation between mass and time as well as angle and time. there was a distinct correlation between length and time. in this experiment there could have been a few systematic and random errors. systematic errors are the errors when the actual measurement is not the same as the assumed measurement. in this particular experiment there were a few examples like the timer, stopwatch, weight and length of the pendulum, these were all assumed and could have been different from the actual measurement. random errors are malfunctions in the measuring device these would be examples like the timer or scale could have been off by a few units. to reduce error multiple trials were conducted and a photogate was introduced to the lab. a photogate measure the time in each period instead of using a timer and an operator the photogate does it for you. this will reduce both systematic and random error. in the final plot the goal was to reach an r-squared value close to 1 and the r- squared value resulted at the end of the experiment resulted as 0.99321. proving that length and time on a pendulum are directing correlated.
