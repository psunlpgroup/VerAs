conclusion:
to sum up, we were trying to find what variables, mass, drop angle, and string length affected the period of a pendulum. as shown by our data above, the only thing to affect the period of a pendulum was string length. as shown in table 1, the mass changing had no affect on the time of the period. looking at table two will demonstrate how the drop angle also did not affect the period of the pendulum. finally, if you look back to table three you will see how the string length was positively correlated with the period of the pendulum. this correlation was then retested and as shown in table 4, we can confidently say the sting length does, in fact, affect the period of a pendulum. during each test the other two variables were held constant to ensure only one variable was being tested at a time. if you look at the equation for the final graph it can be closely related to the known definition of a period of a pendulum which is 2pi times the square root of length of the string divided by the acceleration due to gravity. the theoretical model also states that the angle should be less than 30 degrees which is consistent with our data in graph 2 and the mass does not affect this period and is consistent with graph 1. some errors to account for in our testing will be the systematic approach we had. human reaction time played a big role in this error and the way we eliminated that was by using electronic equipment. another error could possibly be setting up the angle a few degrees off, but since the angle does not affect the period this is not too big of a deal and could be negligible. this experiment also had a few limitations. we had limited mass to work with and limited string to use, therefor our data is generally correct but cannot be applied to the extremes.
