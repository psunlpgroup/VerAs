Discussion and Conclusion:
The purpose of the lab was to figure out what factors affect the acceleration of a cart on a track. In part one we tested the ratio of hanging weight to weight on the cart and realized that as the ratio increased so did the acceleration just like we predicted. There was a very high r value for are our experiment showing that there was very little error and uncertainty in our results. Our equation was $A=38.164 x-7.2$, which is linear like and positive like the theoretical model. The other group we checked with had a very similar shaped graph showing that there is a linear relationship between mass ratio and acceleration. In Part two we saw that as the slope increases acceleration decreases, both of the other groups we compared with had very similar results showing a lower acceleration for an increased upward slope, or added height to the ramp on the side with the pulley. The equations we got was, $A=0.0304 x-0.0567$,  $A=0.0304 x-0.0318$, $A=0.0302 x-0.0142$, and .0303-.0567, They are all linear and positive just like the theoretical model. If a heavier string were used the acceleration would decrease, due to an increase in friction. Random error could have been cause by the levelness of the table or track. We could have decreased this by using a level to make sure the table was level. We also could have used a more accurate device to make the slope of the track bigger. We could have used a more precise balance to decrease random error. Constraints were time and accuracy of equipment. If we had more time we could have done more trials which would have decreased random error. With better more accurate and precise equipment our measurements would be more precise and accurate leading to better data with less error.
