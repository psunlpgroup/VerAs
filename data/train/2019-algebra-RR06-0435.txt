discussion and conclusion 

the research question investigated in experiment 3 was whether friction effects the acceleration of the cart with varying hanging and resting masses. in all of the graphs the error bars are too small to be seen. the equation for each of the graphs, no friction, 2 magnets, and 4 magnets, are as follows is  . the r^2 values are .997, .9993, and .9978 respectively. these equations are similar to the equations obtained by another group (group number not available), who discovered is  .7622x + .0575, and $y=0.4672 x - 0.0318$. the r^2 values are .999, .9699, and .9628 respectively. the data that the second group obtained does differ slightly than our data given that one of their y-intercepts is positive and all of our as negative. similarly, the coefficient for x is significantly larger than theirs in the last two equations (we had coefficients of 2.104, and 1.744 and they had coefficients of .7622 and ,4672). this may be due to the fact that we ran a trial with 0 applied force on each experiment- which does slightly skew our results as can be seen in figures 5, 6, and 7. there were no other groups for us to compare to so it is hard to tell who’s equations are more correct.
the equation $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ indicates how the acceleration will change if there is only one variable acting upon it. for example when bobbers are added to the edge of the table, the mass of the system doesn’t actually change, however the force acting upon the cart (f) gets larger, causing the acceleration to increase as well. the inverse of this is true as well. the equation $a=c1 w+c2$ states the same thing where c1 is the applied force and c2 is the mass of the system. as the applied force increases, so too should the acceleration. 
the enhanced theoretical equation for the acceleration of a system is  $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$, is very useful in determining the acceleration of a system with more than one force acting upon it. any external force is a force that is not inherently within the system (f is inherent to the system where fext is not). examples of external forces could be gravity or the force of friction as found by figures 6 and 7. as the force of friction increases by the addition of magnets, so does fext, however it is important to note that the force of friction is negative so it decreases the overall acceleration in a linear fashion. 
random error within all experiments is due to the uncertainty found in the rotor. additionally, the weights of the bobbers are not 100% correct because the measuring instrument used was not an electronic balance and did not give values to a decimal place. the uncertainty denoted by the computer program was so small that it was negligible due to the higher uncertainty in the rotor itself. in order to reduce some of the random error in the experiment a more accurate balance could be used as well as a more accurate rotor. by having bobbers that were not correctly weighed, the applied force will be skewed which would impact the acceleration. 
while there weren’t too many opportunities for random error in this experiment, the big one would be reading the weight measurements from the balance scales, where the hash marks could be rounded differently depending on who was recording the measurements. systematic error could be reduced by having the same individual take all the measurements and use the same rounding technique between measurements. as mentioned earlier, the weight of the bobbers would have an impact on the applied force and therefore the acceleration of the cart in the experiments.
constraints within the experiments include the lack of time to perform more trials (which would have yielded a more accurate equation in all graphs), inaccurate measuring devices such as the rotor and weight measuring device. as mentioned before- inaccurate measuring of weights will skew the final accelerations, the graphs, and resulting equations. if the bobbers are overestimated the applied force will be too high and if the bobbers are underestimated the applied force will be too low.
