discussion and conclusion:

the purpose of these labs was to be able to conduct and design experiments to determine mathematical models from the data and to investigate how aspects of the lab settings contribute to these models.

in lab 05, we discovered that the acceleration was proportional to the force due to gravity of the hanging mass divided by the mass of the system ($f=m_{sys} a$), so the acceleration is given by    $a = \frac{f}{m1+m2}$. in lab 06 however, the y-intercept on the lines of best-fit on the graphs are important. in our calculations we see that for an angle of decline, the net force of the air-track mass is equal to $f1 = m1 a$ $f1 = t + m1 g \sin\theta$ and the net force of the hanging mass is $f2 = m2 a$ $f= m2 g-t$. to find the net force of the system, we add these two net forces to get is  $f = m1 a + m2 a$ $f= (t + m1 g \sin\theta) + (m2 g-t)$  $f = m1 g \sin\theta + m2 g$. therefore, our acceleration is equal to $a =\frac{m2 g+m1 g \sin\theta}{m1+m2}$ . the acceleration for an angle of incline is simple, in that you just subtract the y-intercept because the incline is acting against the acceleration. this makes sense in the context of our labs because all the mathematical models provided a greater acceleration for an angle of decline (cart moving downhill) than the model with no angle because the decline provides another force to the tension of the cart, making a greater acceleration. the opposite applies to an angle of incline.
systematic errors in our lab may be attributed to an unclean track surface or air resistance. both of these are friction forces, which would impede motion, therefore leading to a smaller acceleration. because of this knowledge, we ensured that the track was clean and that we maintained an organized and consistent procedure technique.

some constraints that may limit our generalizability could be technical errors with the pulley measuring device or not having a high or low enough track incline. also, the range of masses could be greater, which may lead to a more reliable model.

all of our models are consistent with newtonâ€™s second law in that they follow the form $a =\frac{f}{m_{sys}}$ . in lab 06, the models had the extension of a y-intercept to account for the x-component of the force of the cart due to the incline, which had the form $a =\frac{f- m1 g \sin\theta}{m1+m2}$ (note is  the y-intercept in lab 05 was most likely caused by environmental frictional forces, like kinetic surface friction or air resistance, as it was assumed to have no incline).
