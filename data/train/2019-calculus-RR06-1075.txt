discussion and conclusion: 
the question, “is there a relationship between the friction between the sled and the track and the acceleration of the sled?”, was answered by the results obtained by performing the procedures. part ii of the lab concluded that the friction between the sled and the track and the acceleration of the sled are related. part ii of the lab concluded that as the force of friction between the sled and the track decreases, the acceleration of the sled increases and likewise, as the force of friction between the sled and the track increases, the acceleration of the sled decreases. this relationship can be expressed by the mathematical model found on the graph above. errors found in this experiment are related to air resistance. in conclusion, by performing the procedure and analyzing the data yielding from the procedure we can conclude that the friction between the sled and the car and the acceleration are inversely related and can be mathematically expressed by the equation found on the graph above.
