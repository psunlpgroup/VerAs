conclusion:

	for the entirety of these labs we worked with a pendulum to try and discover exactly what affects the period of each swing of the pendulum. out of the three independent variables we discovered that the weight has no correlation while the angle and the length of the string do. the reason we are able to tell that the weight, or mass, of the object on the pendulum had no correlation was due to the representation on the graph. the graph showed that there was no particular or constant way that the mass had affected the period of the pendulum. the error bars on the graph had also clarified that reasoning. the length of the string was constant throughout the experiments with the pendulum and the error bars were small enough to show we did not have that much error. the angle of release also was fairly constant throughout the experiments with the pendulum, and the error bars also showed that we did not have too much error in our results. the theoretical equation for the period of a pendulum is $t=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}$. the equation is able to show the possible period for the pendulum. we were able to reduce the amount of errors we had by using control variables for each experiment. the constraints that we had during the experiments could include any problems with the technology we were using, like the stopwatches or the object that we used to measure the periods when it was connected to the computer.
