discussion and conclusion

the purpose of the lab was to discover how changes in applied force affect the acceleration of an object (in our case a cart). another goal of the lab was to develop mathematical models which describe the behavior of a real system (lab 05) as well as to develop an understanding for each variable and numerical value included in the model (lab 06).

as seen in graphics 1 and 2, the data collected from lab 5 yielded to the following mathematical model in relation to table 1 is  $a=22.2 f + 1$ and the r^2 value was .951. this mathematical model was incorrect due to errors made in our calculation, when recalculated we found that the true equation was $a=2.89 f - 0.0506$. this model shows that as the applied force is increased so is the acceleration and the -.0506 is caused by the error in our model. the force applied increased as mass of the car was decreased, and mass of the hanging weight was increased. the graphical model shows a linear relationship between force applied and acceleration. next, we can analyze the data from part two in lab 5 which is shown in graphics 3 and 4. the original mathematical model was $a=1.79 - 9.261 m$ this model is incorrect and did not match our peers, we then went and looked over our calculations and found errors in our units and values and calculations. the calculations were redone to find that the true model was $a=\frac{0.375}{m^{0.997}}$ this model shows that as the mass of the cart increases the acceleration of the cart decreases, the equation shows that this is a slight negative power correlation. in lab 6 three different mathematical models were developed based upon graphics 5, 6, 7, and 8. the first model developed was with no magnets present and was very similar to that found in part 1 of lab 5, the equation is $a=2.88 f - 0.0275$. this model shows a linear relationship between the applied force and the acceleration when no magnets are present. for two magnets the model was $a=2.24 f - 0.038$ and for four magnets the model was 1.89(f) - .0395. these two models show that the relationship between force applied and acceleration remains positive and linear, but as the magnets were attached (friction increased), the slope of the models became smaller which shows that the force applied had less of an effect meaning that there was a new force opposing it. 

two other groups models were used to further scrutinize and compare our models to theirs to determine the validity of our models. the two groups data that were used were groups 4 and 3. 



 

the data from group 4 closely aligns with our data and shows that as magnets are added the slope of the mathematical model decreases. these mathematical models help to determine that the number the force is multiplied by represents 1/m as the equation for force is $f = m a$ and $a =\frac{f}{m}$ meaning the number multiplied by the force is 1/m and the number that is subtracted from the model is due to error. this is true because this number is not present in the force equation and is so small that it is almost inconsequential, it also affects each point the same which shows that it is error in this case. 

possible sources of error in this lab would have been friction on the cart, friction on the pulley, inaccurate masses, and human error when trying to measure the force and the acceleration. actions that were taken to minimize these sources of error was that an air track was used to create minimal friction, the pulley that was used had minimal friction, the masses that were used were premeasured and were weighed by our group before each trail, and finally in order to minimize the amount of human error a computer program was used to measure the acceleration. the friction error was systematic as it affected the entire system, the mass and human error are random as we cannot determine the exact way in which they will affect the graph, we cannot determine the exact amount of error created by humans or by the masses. a final possible source of systematic error would be error in the acceleration sensor, there could have been issues with calibration or the sensor itself could be broken.

some constraints that would prevent generalization of results would be the type of string as it could be ductile in nature or could be more rigid which would cause a change in results. the sensor used could have different coefficients of friction depending on brand and age and model. to get true general results we would need a prefect system which, we as students, do not have access to yet. 

the mathematical model in part 1 of lab 5 follows the model of $f=m a$ because the model takes the form of $a =\frac{f}{m}$. the same can be said for the mathematical models created in lab 6 as they also follow this general pattern. part 2 of lab 5 also follows the model of $f=m a$, but this equation is exponential, this is following the model of $a =\frac{f}{m}$and the power that the 1/f is raised to is due to error. all the models that were found are variations of $f=m a$ as it is a basic law of physics and must be followed, the only way a model would not match newtons second law is if an error was made in calculations.
