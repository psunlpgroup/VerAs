conclusion: 

research question: will the length of the string and the angle of release influence the pendulum.

the research question was concluded to be true. the length of the string affected the period the most while the angle of release affected it but minimally (within 1 second). in the graphs of each lab the data shows that the weight of the pendulum does not affect the period while the length and angle affect the period.



period of the pendulum equation is  $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$

the results of the three labs agrees with the theoretical equation, this is true because the only variable of the tested variables within the equation is length.

through the solution of increasing the trial numbers in each lab, the amount of error in the data decreased.

through the experiments the constraints were; the string length had to be within a meter, the angle of release could only be below 90 degrees, and the weight could only be a maximum of 250g and a minimum of 50g.
