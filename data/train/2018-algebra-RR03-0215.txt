conclusion:

	the research question was what variables in the pendulum affect the length of the period; angle, mass, and length. the systematic errors during the experiment include, incorrect weights, human error during angle of release and timing, and incorrect measurement tools. the random errors include, random bumps while people were recording data. in a perfect experiment that doesn’t have any of these would require a machine to be built and calibrated to drop a perfectly measured weight at a very precise angle with no air resistance and a photo gate to measure the period of the pendulum. in the third lab we were able to reduce a lot of systematic error by using the photo gate but that’s all that we had access to. the constraints of the experiment were mainly humans limitations when collecting data as well as random and systematic errors in data. 	

	the length of the pendulum was the only independent variable that shows to have a very strong correlation to the length of the period. in the third lab the standard deviation of the graph was .9833 which is more than enough to conclude its relationship to time. the mass of the load showed a very small correlation to the length of the period but its increase in the time of the pendulum was very small, the slope of the equation was only 0.004. which isn’t enough to show that the mass affects the period. the angle of release didn’t show any correlation to the length of the period, the slope of the best fit line is very small and the data is skewed along that line. with this we can confidently say that the length of the pendulum is the only variable that affects the period of the pendulum.
