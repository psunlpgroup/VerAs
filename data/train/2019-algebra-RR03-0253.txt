discussion/conclusion:

the research question being investigated is what variables affect the time period of a pendulum for small swings. in the first week of lab (tables 1-3) all independent variables were being tested so we can conclude which variables actually affect time period of swing. from the data in the first week it was concluded that length of string was the independent variable that affected time period of a pendulum. in the second week of lab (table 4) the independent variable that affected time period of a swing were tested again with better technique and applying ways in which any errors are reduced. with this data the error bars were calculated to determine the range of uncertainty our data has and where the true value lies within the range. finally, in the third week of lab (table 5) the length of string was retested with a photogate which is a very accurate measuring tool for time period.  with this new equipment the time was calculated with such accuracy that the error bars were reduced significantly. the theoretical mathematical model was  and the data from table 5 fits with that model because it is closest to the model      $y=\sqrt{x}$            and that is closest to the theoretical mathematical model. the systematic or random errors that occurred in this experiment was technique/execution and the measuring tools. the random error would be the technique used and it was fixed by averaging calculation and taking multiple measurements for data. the systematic error were the measuring tools and it was first fixed by recalibrating any tools and then by using a more accurate tool (photogate) to measure the time period in a more accurate manner.
