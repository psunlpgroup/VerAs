discussion and conclusion

	the reason we performed this experiment was to find a relationship between our independent variables and dependent variable. when carrying out the testing with mass as our independent variable and period as our dependent variable we kept the angle and length of the pendulum the same throughout this trial. we timed the pendulum as it swung to the best of our abilities. human error was very apparent in this part of the experiment. when we had the length as our independent variable we had the same dependent variable however this time we kept the mass and angle the same while changing the length of the pendulum, this resulted in the finding that the length has an effect on the period of a pendulum. we went through the same process with angle of departure as our independent variable by keeping the mass and length the same and found no relationship between it and the period of the pendulum. random errors include mistiming, mismeasurement, and possible environmental factors. these could be reduced through performing the experiment in a more professional environment with more professional tools.
