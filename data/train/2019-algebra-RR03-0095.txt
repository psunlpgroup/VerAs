conclusion:
In Lab03 (Creating Mathematical Models), the group conducted an experiment to observe and determine how factors of a pendulum such as the length of its string, the mass on it, as well as the angle from which it is released affects its period via plotting the data on a mathematical model.
So, we recalled from experiment 2 that the data trend for mass was inconclusive because of how weak of a correlation was shown, proving that angle at release and string length are what controls the period of a pendulum. Considering this, we hypothesized that the string length would effect the period. So, we set up an experiment releasing the pendulum from the same angle every time while keeping the mass constant and changing the string length by a similar amount each time in order to observe the change in the period measuring the average period over 7 periods for each specific string length tried. 
Our Hypothesis turned out to be correct however we predicted a more decipherable or larger trend as to the change bought on by the change in string length. This trend also has a very small margin of error when compared to the trendline the group calculated, which is not only small but consistent with its difference by .0015 seconds.
