	conclusion: 
	For this set of experiments, we used several different variations of weight in a set to measure the acceleration of a falling weight pulling on a mass. We used a triple bean balance to measure the different variations of weight and a lab recorder to measure the acceleration of the mass hanging off the end of the string. The research question was how does the acceleration of a system change when the applied force changes. The dependent variable was the position of the block. The Independent variable was the force applied to the ball. And the controls for the experiment was the mass of the system at 38.6g, gravity at 9.8m/s^2 and no friction adding resistance to the block being pulled. The Hypothesis is when the mass of the ball increases the force applied to the block increases as well. Our prediction was that as the mass of the ball falling increased the force applied to the block would increase linearly since $F=M A$. Our systematic errors were the friction the string applied to the pulley as well as the rotational force it took to get the wheel to spin. 
In conclusion as the mass of the ball increases the force applied to the block increases as well. We can see this by the linear relationship shown in the graph of Mass vs. Acceleration above. The equation that can be derived from that set of data is $y=22.691 x + 0.37$ which is linear so there for as the acceleration increases in the falling mass the force applied to the block that is being pulled increases as well. 
	Lab 6 is  During this lab we were mainly comparing the data that each group produced in lab 5 and trying to derive an equation from these two sets of data. When we did this we found that they had a far more linear graph that we did. However, our equation was still linear it just looked slightly exponential which could easily just be to slightly offset data.

	Once we were done presenting our data and conclusions to each group Jerrod asked us to find the amount of weight needed to accelerate the system .40985 m/s^2. To solve this we needed to use the equations associated with newton’s second laws. We created a force diagram to better understand all of the inputs. We settled on $m2=\frac{m1-a}{(g-a)}$ and through this we found the final mass which was 14.1g. When we tested this we got an acceleration of .404m/s^2 which is very close to what we were solving for. This has an uncertainty of .00326 which is very precise. 
	After both of these labs we can clearly see that there is a direct correlation between the acceleration of a system and the force applied to a system. This supports our hypothesis that was made back in lab 5 that they had a linear relationship. This can be supported by our data and our graphs. When we made our mathematical model based off of the graphs we derived $a=c1 w+c2$ which when compared to the theoretical equation that this rubric gave us of $f=m_{sys} a$ our equation is supported by the theoretical equation. We saw this by inputting test points as well as looking at the structure of the equation and how the variables interacted. The enhanced theoretical equation of $a=\frac{f}{m_{sys}} + \frac{f_{ext}}{m_{sys}}$ is also supported by our equation that we derived from the graph since the extra F that is being applied is also divided by the mass this would keep with our findings as well as the previous theoretical models. If the system had a heavier string connecting the two masses this would only increase the mass of the system not to a specific mass on either end. So for a certain weight combination you would have a higher acceleration but it would be linear and constant compared to the other data points on the graph. The systematic errors are the same as stated in lab 5, the frication and rotational force lost due to the pulley measurement. The random errors could have been the trolley randomly scraping against the surface of the track adding force due to friction or anything else we couldn’t have accounted for. However, this would have had extremely little impact on the data we collected. The major constraints are pretty much detailed in the systematic errors. We need the pulley to rotate so we could collect data on the acceleration and also that no surface is perfectly frictionless. Due to these factors our data could only be so accurate.
