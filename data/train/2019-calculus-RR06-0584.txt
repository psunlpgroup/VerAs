coonclusion:
the purpose of lab five was to run different tests that would in result make a mathematical model that would explain how increasing the hanging weight would change the acceleration of the cart. in lab six we ran similar test by changing the amount of friction that the cart had by adding magnets to the side. the results of these tests made another model explaining this change in acceleration. i know that the models for lab five shows how a decrease in the weight of the cart and increase the hanging weight changes acceleration, but iâ€™m not sure what the numbers in the model mean.

 group one had the same hypothesis as us, saying that as magnets are added the acceleration will change. their hypothesis helps confirm that my group is correct. possible errors could come from releasing the cart incorrectly. using newtons second law $f=m a$ to find a manipulate the equation so its $\frac{f}{m}= a$. when the mass of the cart decreases, and force stays constant then the acceleration will increase. this also works the other, when mass of the cart increases then the acceleration will decrease.
