The initial drop should be 5m because 2m is too short for less fun, and 5m also gives more total energy. The data shows that a release height of 2m with a 50 kg cart gives 977J of PE, but a release height of 5m with a 50 kg cart gives 2443J of PE. When PE decreases, the KE increases, because the TE always remain constant, due to PE + KE = TE. The hill height should not be too high but not too short either, because a tall hill height won't make the car make it to the end but too short of a hill is not that fun. So the hill height should be 4.5m in a vacuum, because going up, you are transferring KE to PE. You need KE to move, so if the hill is also is 5m, you won't have enough KE or PE to make it up. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. In a vacuum, there is a direct relationship between drop height and hill height, because the higher the hill, the greater the drop height needs to be to overcome the hill. The evidence shows that a 5m drop and a 5m hill will not make the hill, but a 5m drop and a 4m hill will make the hill. The car weight is not that important for this rollercoaster, but if you increase the mass, you increase the TE and if you decrease the mass, you decrease the TE. It is a direct relationship. A 60 kg cart with a 5m drop has 2932J of TE. However, a cart with 40kg has only 1955J of TE, but it will also reduce the energy needed to accelerate the cart, so in reality, keeping it at 50kg will not have any benefits or cons.
