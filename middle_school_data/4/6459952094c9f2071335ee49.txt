Hello Gonzales family,

For the best roller coaster, it should have a lot of energy and be safe .  To do that it has to have a big initial drop.  with a bigger initial drop you will have a high Pe and Ke. And if the added hill is to big the cart wont make it to the end.  with energy you can not destroy or create it meaning the Pe goes to Ke down the hill. and a higher mass mean higher Pe which means higher Ke and speed.  

            the roller coaster would feature a 5.00 m initial drop with 2 hills of 4.15 m and 2.5 m and 4 loops before the ride ends.  The ride would be a duration of about 3.5 mins.  it would have a top speed of 115 mph.  It would also pull 5 g's.  And it would have to be safe, so we would have the best safety mechanisms so people are safe from the 5 g's of force.
