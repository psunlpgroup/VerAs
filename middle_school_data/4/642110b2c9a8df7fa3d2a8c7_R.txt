The roller coaster with a drop of 5 meters, a hill of 4.5 meters, and a loop of 4 meters is a very exciting ride that will thrill any thrill-seekers. The roller coaster's initial drop gives it enough energy to make it through the rest of the track, and a higher hill would slow it down too much to make it through the rest of the ride.

As the roller coaster drops down the first hill, riders will feel a rush of adrenaline as they are propelled forward by gravity. The roller coaster then climbs up the second hill, which is slightly lower than the first, but still provides a thrilling sensation as riders crest the top and then drop back down. The roller coaster then enters the loop when, where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness as they upside down.

Throughout the ride, the roller coaster's seat with a mass of 60 kilograms experiences a series of forces that make the ride so thrilling. As the roller coaster drops, the seat experiences an increase in speed and kinetic energy. As the coaster climbs the second hill, the seat experiences a decrease in speed and an increase in potential energy. As the coaster enters the loop, the seat experiences a force that keeps it in place as it travels upside down.

Total energy refers to the overall amount of energy that something has. That includes all energy, or in other words Kinetic energy, Potential Energy, and Thermal energy.

Energy transformation is the process of changing energy from one form to another. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another. This means that the total amount of energy in a system remains constant, even though it may change from one form to another.

Mass is the amount of stuff, It is a measure of how much stuff is packed into an object. Energy is the ability to do work or make things happen. It can come in many forms, like light, heat, and motion. Energy can be transferred from one object to another, and it can be converted from one form to another. Mass and Energy are related because they converted from one to another.

In conclusion, a roller coaster with an initial drop of 5 meters, a hill of 4.5 meters, and a loop of 4 meters is an exciting ride that will leave riders feeling the rush. The roller coaster's design ensures that riders experience a range of forces throughout the ride.
