The height of the drop will always determine if the energy will be larger or if it will be smaller. The smaller the height, the smaller or less amount of energy. The larger or taller height, the more energy. The same amount of energy that is put into the potential energy at the top, the same amount of kinetic energy will be at the bottom. The total energy will always be the same amount as the initial potential energy or the same amount as the potential energy and the kinetic energy added up. Changes between the potential and kinetic energy during the drop include the potential energy will decrease and be put into increasing kinetic energy so then the kinetic energy is equal to the initial potential energy amount. The only time that the kinetic energy would be less than the initial potential energy amount would be when the energy was transformed into thermal energy. The energy wouldn't be lost because of the law of conservation of energy. Also, the initial drop height cannot be smaller than the hill height, or else the roller coaster car will not make it over the hill. The mass is the only controlled variable of the mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy.
