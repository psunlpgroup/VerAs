I chose the initial drop to be 4 m because there is a direct relationship between the height of the initial drop and the potential energy the car has at the top of the drop. A direct relationship is when both the height of the initial drop and the potential energy both go up or both go down. I know this because my data shows a the height gets bigger the potential energy also gets bigger. When the release height was 2.25 the potential energy was 1189 J and when the height was 398 the potential energy was 2211 J. 
 For the hill height I chose 2 m because no matter the height the car would get over the hill. From my data i found that when the initial drop was 4 and the hill height was 2 the car made it over easily. 4 is about in the middle of our options. When the initial drop was 4 and the hill height was 2 the car did make it over and when the hill height was 5 is did not make it over so I chose 4 m and 2 m.
For the mass of the car I chose 50 kg. There is a direct relationship between the mass of the car and the potential energy the car has at the top of the initial drop. I know this because as the mass was a constant weight of 50 kg the potential energy went form 1189 J to 2775 J. There is a direct relationship between the mass of the car and the kinetic energy the car has at the bottom of the initial drop. I know this because when the weight of the car (50 kg) was constant the kinetic energy went form 1188 J to 2774 J.
The total energy will be the same as the amount of potential energy the car has at the top of the initial drop when there is no friction. The total energy will be the same as the amount of kinetic energy the car has at the bottom of the initial drop with no friction.
