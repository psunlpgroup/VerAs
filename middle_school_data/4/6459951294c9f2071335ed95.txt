The science behind why my current roller coaster design will be exciting and will make it to the end of the ride without stopping. The science behind it is my car mass is as high as can be, the initial drop is as high as it can be, the hills are as high as they can be without being the same height or higher than the initial height. The height of the initial drop needs to be an high as it can. This is because the higher it is the more PE it has at the top and the less KE at the top. This is also because the higher it is the less PE it has on the top and the more KE at the bottom. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is PE+KE=TE. It affects the ride because it has to be equal to be able to work. As the car moves down the hill the PE goes up and the KE goes down. The energy transformation is how the energy changes when it goes down a hill or if it si going straight. The law of conservation of energy is how much energy you need to go around the entire roller coaster without using your own energy. The relationship between the initial drop height and the hill height is, the hill height can't be the same height or taller than the initial drop height to be able to make it over the hill. The relation ship between mass, PE and KE is the bigger the mass the more PE you will have at the top of the initial drop. The bigger the mass is the more KE you will have at the bottom of the initial drop.
