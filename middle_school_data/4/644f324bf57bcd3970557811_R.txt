The height of my ID for my roller coaster was 4.5 meters. I chose this height because I found in my data that the higher the drop height was, the more total energy and the more total energy the faster the car will go. The more height the ID has, the more PE and KE there is. This proves that the more height on the initial drop, the more total energy there is. At any given moment on the track, the sum of the PE and KE always equals the TE. The total energy also stays the same for the whole track. This is because you cannot create nor destroy energy, but you can convert it to a different form, and potential energy requires height and kinetic energy doesnâ€™t. If there are hills or any change in elevation on the ride, the PE will decrease and the KE will increase the exact amount that the PE decreased. 

Once the hill height got to an equal height as the top of the ID, the car would not make it over because the potential energy needed to get over the hill is not enough to make it to the end of the ride. The hill height should never be greater than the height of the ID for that reason. This rule also applies to loops, as the height of the ID can never be greater than the height of the loop because the car would not make it to the end. 

 The more mass the car has, the more TE there is. This is because the formula to calculate PE includes mass in it, meaning that the more mass there is the greater the total energy and the faster the car will go. This was proven in my data because when the car's mass was 40 kg, the total energy was 1174 joules. When the mass of my car was 60 kg, the TE was 1760 joules. This proves that the more mass the car has, the more total energy there is.
