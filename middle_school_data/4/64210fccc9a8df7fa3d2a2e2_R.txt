The drop height of our car is going to be 5 meters tall. Because of the height of our drop there is going to be more potential energy at the top of the coaster due to the amount of track that it has to go down. And it will have the same amount of Kinetic energy going down from the initial drop. The total energy that is created from the height of the drop will also effect how high we are able to make our hill. Because if we make the initial drop higher than the hill it will have more total energy and will use less than the total to make it over the hill. The reason it will have the same amount of energy is because the law conservation of mass says "energy cannot be created nor destroyed". This is true in our data also, when we had let it go from 5 meters its potential energy at the top of the drop was 2707 jewels of energy. And as it went down the drop and made it to the end the total energy was the same as it was at the top of the initial drop, 2707 jewels of energy. That changed when we added more or less mass to the car. We started by adding 5 more kilograms to our car to test if the total energy would go up as we added more mass, and it did exactly that. The 55 kilogram car had a total of 2682 jewels of potential energy. The same applied to the Kinetic energy of the coaster, the more mass you add to the car the more acceleration the car will have due to gravity adding more kinetic energy to the car.
The hill height was important to add some thought into as well, if our hill was as high as the initial drop it would not have been possible to even make it over the hill. This result occurred because of the total amount of energy was able to be used for the car. If the drop height was as tall the hill it would use all of its energy to make it up the hill but not have enough to get over it, that's why it had to be smaller than the initial drop.
