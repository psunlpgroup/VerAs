Hello, Gonzales family here are my recommendations for your roller coaster design. First, it should be at 5 meters for the initial drop height. This is because the higher the drop height the more potential energy you will have, at the top, and the same amount of kinetic energy you have at the bottom. This is because the law of energy conservation says "Energy can't be created or destroyed". For the hill height, I believe it should be 4 meters. I recommend this so your car will make it over the hill from the initial drop of 5 meters. The mass of the car should be 50. It's right between the two options and will be just the right amount, especially in a frictionless environment.
