Hello Gonzales family, I am writing this letter to share or recent roller coaster design. Our current design contains of an initial drop of 5 meters, then the ride will continue through a loop then carry on to a hill that leads into the ending hill. I recommend that the initial drop is the highest hill there is in the ride because if there is another one that is bigger, the ride wont have enough potential energy to climb it. I also recommend that most of the drops are still pretty high though so the coaster stays fast throughout the ride
