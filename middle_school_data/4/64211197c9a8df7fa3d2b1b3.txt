I would recommend a starting height of 5 meters and a hill height of 3.5 meters to have the most amount of fun and actually get you across the ride.


The PE and KE depends on the mass and height of the car and initial drop. It depends on the initial drop because the drop will determine how much PE the coaster has at the top and how much KE it has at the bottom of the drop. The mass determines how much total energy there is and how much KE there is at the bottom of the drop .

The PE and KE of the coaster will always add up to the total energy. At the top of the initial drop there will be no KE. The total PE it can have through out the hole ride. For example at the begging of the ride the coaster has 2443 Jules and that the total it has through the hole ride.

The low of conservation of energy applies to this because the TE always equals the KE + PE and energy cant be created nor destroyed.

That is why i recommend a higher height and a medium size of the hill height.
