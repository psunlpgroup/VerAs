My recommendation is we start our roller coaster at the height of 5 because the higher the drop is the more total energy it has. For example when i tested the height of 5 the total energy was 2443. But when i tested the height of 3 the total energy was 1466. At the top of the initial drop the PE will have all the energy at the bottom the energy will have converted into KE but the total energy stays the same. That is because the Law of conservation of energy. The Law of conservation and energy states that energy can be created or destroyed but it can convert to other types of energy. So the total energy will stay the same but the energy with convert from PE to KE and the other way around.The energy will change when it is going down the drop the PE will be less but now it is going faster so KE will go up. Having a greater total energy will help the coaster car make it over the hill and loop. The hill height needs to be less than the height of the initial drop otherwise there will not be enough energy and it wont make it over the hill. So i recommend the hill height be 4. The mass of the car is also very important. The mass can also effect the total energy. For example when i tested the mass of 40 kg the total energy was 1956. But when i tested the mass of 60 the total energy was 2934. So having a higher mass will help the car go faster on the hill and around the loop making it more exiting. I recommend we use a mass of 55. All of this was tested in a friction less scenario. So when we add friction there is other types of energy that will need to be included thermal and sound energy. Thermal and sound energy wont be used so the total energy will go down. So we need to make sure we start with enough total energy to make it to the end.
