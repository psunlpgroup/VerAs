i would recommend Having more mass and more high because, if would want a ride that is good and people like it. and possibly scary you would want a ride that has more mass and more energy. because PE or Potental energy helps it go up faster and creates more of a thrilling start. and also when going down you want the coaster to have alot of speed going up the second hill. so that it can make it up the hill so that it can sloow down the ride in time for it to stop at the very end.
 Another thing i would recommend it that it would need turns at the begining. so it can get some energy to go up hill and then go down the hill and at the end of the 2 hill.s to slo down more I would add turns to it so the kentic enrgy stops and it stop where it started. 
The final thing i would recommend it that it is a big hill for the. first drop and a slighly smaller hill on the second drop you want that because so that it can clear both the hills no matter the total wight of the people on the roller coaster.
My concuion Is Make it high up so that you get a bigger drop so that more KE at the bottom but the turn at the ends helps it slow down.
