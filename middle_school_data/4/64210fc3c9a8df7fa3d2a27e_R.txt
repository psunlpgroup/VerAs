My recommendation for your roller coaster, would be that for the initial drop to be at the tallest it can to get a good momentum to keep your ride going.
The more height there is the more potential energy you'll have, which would make you car have a faster speed. Following that your hill shouldn't be taller than your initial drop a the start because then the car wont be able to make it over. Also your mass shouldn't be huge but not small so right in the middle so the car can do the hills and all the stuff you want it to safely.
The greater amount of height there was more total energy released in the end, But with friction the total amount of energy would go down. The more height there is the more potential energy will be at the top.
As the car goes down and comes to the stop PE goes all the way to 0 meanwhile KE goes up to a higher number. Your energy will stay consistent, the energy changes from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy again. 
The PE and KE depend on the height of the drop because the more the height is the more the PE will be a the top of the ride and the more the KE will be at the bottom of the ride.
