The height of our roller coaster is 5 meters tall, and we made it that way because the higher it is the more energy it will have. At the top of the hill, the roller coaster will have all of the kinetic energy and the potential will be 0J. At the bottom (in a frictionless world) all of the energy has been converted into kinetic and there will be no more potential. Total energy is the PE and the KE added together, but because its usually all the energy in PE or the opposite, you can just guess the higher number. At the top when all the energy is PE because it hasn't started going yet, you can see it convert into KE. It will always just covert because energy cannot be created or destroyed. We also made the car heavier because a bigger weight means more energy to make it go faster.
