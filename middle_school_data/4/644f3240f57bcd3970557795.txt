Rollercoaster Essay #1

Dear Gonzales family, I would love to help you out with this rollercoaster, my company and I have an idea that would be fun, safe, and would make it to the end! 

The initial drop height should be 4.00j, the reasoning for this is because the Potential Energy at the top of the initial drop is 1955j. The kinetic energy at the top is 0j, and the potential energy at the bottom as well is 0j. The kinetic energy at the bottom, and the total energy stayed the same as the initial drop height, it was still 1955j. Now, moving onto the hill height, my team and I believe that the height of the hill should be 3.00j. The potential energy at the top of the initial drop height is 1711j, the kinetic energy of the initial drop is 0j, the Potential energy at the top of the drop is 1474j, the kinetic energy at the top of the hill is 273j, and finally, the total energy is 1711j. When it goes over the hill, it does make it to the end. Lastly, we will be talking about the car mass, the car mass of this is 54j. The potential energy at the initial drop is 2115j. The kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop is 2110j. The total energy of the car mass is 2115j. Energy in this rollercoaster cannot be created nor can it be destroyed, but it can convert from one type of energy to another.  When you increase the mass of the car, the potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy all increase. 


In conclusion, my team and I are confident that the initial drop height should be 4.00j, the hill height should be 3.00j, and the car mass should be 54j. We believe that this will create an exciting, safe, joyful, and fun rollercoaster! Please take my idea into considerationâ€¦


Sincerely,
