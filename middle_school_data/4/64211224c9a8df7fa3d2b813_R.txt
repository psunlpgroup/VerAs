The start to the best roller coaster design is is to find the best heights for the initial drop and hill. You want your hill height to be shorter than the initial drop. The potential energy of the cart at the top of the initial drop will make you go far up the hill but come backwards. This happens due to not being able to get enough KE to get up and over the hill. PE at the top of the drop and KE at the bottom relates to the height because depending on the height of the drop will change the PE to be greater or less. For KE the higher the drop the more KE the cart get's because it's moving faster and further. At the end of the drop the PE and KE added up together will give you your total energy which is all the energy that was stored and the energy that was used to get to the end of the roller coaster. To start the drop of the roller coaster though, the PE is the total energy because the cart isn't moving. On the other hand as the car get's going down the drop their is less PE and KE keeps getting greater. The mass of the roller coaster determines how much PE and KE the cart will have at the top and bottom of the hill. Energy is formed from PE and KE being worked with an object when it is moving or not moving and it's rule that energy can not be created or destroyed but their is a new energy that can be created. If you have these specific additions to your roller coaster you will be able to have fun and make it to the end of your ride.
