Rollercoaster Essay 1# 
Dear Gonzales family I have a proposal for the rollercoaster that will be a safe and fun ride for all the people that come. 

For the initial drop height, I think the Initial drop height should be 4 meters. For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 2112J. When I increased the drop height to 4.25 meters, The PE increased to 2244J. Now for the hill height, I think the hill height should be 3 meters because when I had the hill height at 4 meters it didn't go over because when the friction was at 0.2 it wasnâ€™t going over so you can't have the hill at 4 meters but you can have it at 3 meters because the car will go over the hill with friction at 0.2. Next for the mass of the car, I think it should be 54kg because if you increase the car mass with 0.2 friction it is harder to get the car over the hill. Lastly The height of the loop, I think the loop should be 3.50 meters because if the car mass was bigger it wouldn't be a bale to go over. So in conclusion, those are my suggestions for the rollercoaster for the Gonzales family.
