The drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters. This is because the greater the height, the greater the energy. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 1173 at the top of the drop. When I made the drop height 5 meters, the PE was 2932. That means that the PE was increased when the height increased. Similarly, at the bottom of a drop height of 2 meters, the KE was 1173. Then, at the bottom of a drop height of 5 meters, the KE was 2932. This also shows the relationship between PE, KE, and total energy. The PE and KE always add up to be the total energy. For example, when the drop was 3 meters, the PE at the top of the drop was 1762, and the KE was 0. When added, they equal 1762, which is the total energy. The PE and KE always balance each other out. They never don't equal the total energy (when there is no friction). As the car goes down the drop, the PE transforms into KE. When the PE goes down, the KE goes up. The total energy will always stay the same (when there is no friction) throughout the trial because energy cannot be created or destroyed. 

When I added a hill, it always had to be lower than the drop height or else the car couldn't make it to the end. For example, the drop height was 5 meters and the hill was 3 meters, the car made it over the hill with ease. Then, when I changed the hill height to 5 meters, with still a drop height of 5 meters, the car couldn't make it over the hill. 

The mass and the energy has a direct relationship. When the mass goes up, the PE goes up. When the mass goes down, the KE goes down. This means that when there is a greater mass, there is a greater energy.
