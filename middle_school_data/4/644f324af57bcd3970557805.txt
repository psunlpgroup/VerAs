Dear Gonzales family,

We have tested multiple heights, drops, and loops and finally found the correct measurements and hill heights for your new roller coaster we also understand that if we increase our heights our P.E. will also increase in case we need to add adjustments. First, we should start with our ID ( Initial Drop ) height, we decided on the size of 3.35m we chose this because we believe that if the Initial Drop is more significant than the Hill Height and loop height the car will make it to the end of the coaster. We also want to make sure the height is safe. Next, we chose the Hill Height for this we decided on the height of 2.75m, because as I said the Hill Height needs to be smaller than the ID height. We did recognize that this height was similar to the ID but we believe it will still work because when the Hill Height is higher or lower than the ID height the KE is higher than zero. Then, we chose the car mass of 55kg this will make sure that the car will reach the end of the coaster. Lastly, we added a loop so our Loop height will be 2m because by this time our car wonâ€™t have much energy left then we decided to make the drop the smallest measurement for safety and a ensured great ride.
