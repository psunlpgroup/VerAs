This roller coaster design works well because it starts with an initial drop. In our experiment, we tried having cars start at different heights. What we found was that cars that started at a higher height had more potential energy at the start, as well as more kinetic energy at the bottom. For example, the car that was released from 2 meters had a PE of 977J and a KE of 977J. The car that was released from 5 meters had a PE to start of 2443 and a KE at the end of 2443. We would recommend your initial drop start at a higher point in order to increase its energy. 

Rollercoasters have hills to make them more exciting. We did experiments to see how tall the hills could be to make sure the cars make it over. In our trials, if the hills got bigger than 3 meters, the cars did not make it over to the end. In designing your rollercoaster, these hills would have to be planned for so the cars can keep moving. 

A third thing we looked for was the mass of the cars and how that impacted the energy. In our experiments, the cars with more mass had greater PE and KE. The car was 44 kilograms and had a total energy of 1285J. The car that was 50 kilograms had a total energy of 1467J. The cars would have to have the right amount of mass to create enough energy for the rollercoaster to move at a good speed and keep it exciting. 

So overall when we focused on the height of the initial drop, more hills, and how mass led to more energy. When you build your rollercoaster these are things that you should consider. I look forward to making this rollercoaster with my partners.
