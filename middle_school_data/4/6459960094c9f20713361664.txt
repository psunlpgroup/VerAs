I believe at start they should mass the initial drop the biggest with a good amount of mass.Then if they add a hill they should make it smaller then the first so they can make it over. If they want to make a loop tho they should make the loop plus the hill smaller then the drop or even better do the loop before the hill. If they want to make it big i think they should add another drop and just repeat and for the start of the ride they should have a chain under the track to pull the up to the first drop.
