        Rollercoaster Essay #1
 Dear Gonzala family

Youâ€™ll be happy to know that I have done all the math and science for the coster. And the drop height of my coster design is 5 meters.

When I was testing 6 meters, the PE was 1613J. When I increased the drop height from 2 to 5 meters the PE was 977J and it went up to 2443J. And the KE at the bottom

For the hill height, I decided to have the height be 3.5 meters, the PE is 1714J. As I was testing which height would be the best I changed it from 2 to 3.5 meters the TE was 170J and that went up to 1714J so for the hill height I think 3.5 would be the best.
