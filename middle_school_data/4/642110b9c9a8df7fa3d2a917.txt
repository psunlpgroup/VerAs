I think for the initial drop height we should do 5. I think this because with a higher initial drop it increases the PE at the top of the hill being 2443 J. Rather than having a initial drop height of like 2 which would create a decrease in PE at the top of the hill being 979 shown by the data we collected. Also with 5 as a initial drop it makes us have more TE to be used entirely by the KE plus the PE since we are in an environment without friction. So meaning at the bottom of the hill we will have more KE for the roller coaster to use, but going down the roller coaster the PE will start to become KE .
Secondly for the hill height I think we should do 4. Using 4 we are successfully able to go over the hill without going backwards, and we are able to have some PE at the top of the hill combined with some KE. The big reason we are able to do 4 is because it is a smaller height than the initial drop. Meaning the physics work for a hill at the height of 4, and if something were to go wrong we have the extra .99 m to work with so the rollercoaster is safe at all means.
Finally for the mass i think that we should do 60 kg. I think this because we want more speed and the data shows that if we have more kg for the mass the more PE, KE, and TE we get. for example when we use 60 kg the number of PE at the top of the hill and the number of KE at the bottom is significantly bigger then if we were to use a number like 50 kg which would create less TE. So the bottom line is the more mass there is the more PE and KE we get when at the top, on, or at the bottom of the roller coaster.
