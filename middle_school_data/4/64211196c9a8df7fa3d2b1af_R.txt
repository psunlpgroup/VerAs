Dear Gonzales Family,
The drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters, because it makes the ride more fun, and makes it so that the car can make it to the end of the ride. When you start with a higher drop height you start with a higher PE, which as a result gives the coaster more KE and speed, PE converts into KE. This happens because as the car moves down the initial drop or down the hill, it loses PE and gains KE. Friction can affect the amount of total energy, potential energy, and kinetic energy, the sum of PE and KE is how we calculate total energy. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1466 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased to 1955 Joules. The more amount of total energy, the more speed. If you start at 5 meters your car will be able to get over a hill that is 4 meters as long as there is no friction. I hope you consider my input when thinking about coasters!
