i would recommend Having m.ore mass. and more high because,. if would want a ride. that is good and people like it. and possibly sc.ary you would wa.nt a ride that has more mass and more energy. beca.use PE or Potental energy. helps it go up faster and creates more. o.f a thrilling s.t.a.rt. and also when going down you want. the coaster to h..ave. alot of speed. going up the. second hill. so t.hat it can. make it up the hill so that it can s.loow. down t.he ride in time for it t.o stop at. the. very end. Another thi.ng Is that Energy or KE. will bge more at t.he Bo.ttom. then.. the top......
 Another thin..g i wo.uld r...ec.ommend i.t that it wou.ld n.eed turns at. the begining. so it.. can get some energy to go ..up hill and th.en go dow,..n the hill and at the ..end. of the .2 hill..s to slo do..wn more I would add turns to.. it so the ken.tic enrgy stops a.nd it st.o.p where it s.tarted. 
The final th.ing i would rec.ommend. it that ..it is a big .hil.l for the. first drop and a slighly smaller hill on the second d.ro.p y.ou w.ant that beca.us.e so that it can clear bot..h the hills no matter the total wight of the people on th..e r.oller coaster.
My concuion Is M.ake it .high up s.o that yo.u get a big.ger . so that more KE at the bottom but the turn at the ends helps it slow. down.
