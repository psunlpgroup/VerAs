Dear gonzolas family, 

we believe that we found a rollercoaster that works with an ID of 5 meters and a cool loop in the middle that's 4.4 meters and then we end it off with a nice 2-meter drop. 

 We think this will be a good option because it's safe, fast, and exciting. The reason we decided to do a loop that's 4.4 meters is that it just makes it over with the friction and a 5-meter ID. 

Second, we made a small hill to end it just so it would add some more attraction. PE converts to KE as it goes down the ID and up hills/down hills so the energy will go back and forth between KE and PE. The more mass a car has the faster the car will travel.

PE converts to KE as the car goes down the hill and the higher the hill the more conversion you will have between PE going to KE. The higher the ID the more PE you will have because the will have more energy to use or convert to KE. By adding PE and KE together you can get TE. The TE is total energy, total energy is the max amount of energy that the car or object has.
