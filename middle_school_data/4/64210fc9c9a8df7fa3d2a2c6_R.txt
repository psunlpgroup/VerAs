I want the height of the initial drop to be 5. When the initial drop is at a higher height that means that the potential energy is larger. Unlike when the initial drop is at a smaller height. In a model when the PE (potential energy) is higher the KE (kinetic energy) is smaller. When the KE is higher the PE is lower. In a frictionless world, our models have shown that the total energy is the same as the potential energy in the beginning and the kinetic energy at the end. This means that the total energy is the same as the PE in the beginning and the KE in the end. The law of conservation of energy is that no energy can be created or destroyed. That proves that when there is no friction the total energy never changes, it will always in that case add up to the same amount. The drop height has to be taller than the hill height. If it isn't the roller coaster car won't go over the hill. So for that reason, the hill height must be smaller than the initial drop height for the roller coaster car to be able to make it to the end. Our group's hill height is 3 because our initial drop height is 5. When the mass is more the potential energy is more and that also means the kinetic energy is too when the car is in motion.
