the drop height of the roller coaster should be five meters tall. So the car will always make it over the hill because of its potential energy at the top is more than it will be at the top of the hill so the car will make it over. Then the hill height should be three meters tall because its not to low that the potential energy will be nowhere near the potential energy on top of the drop . Then the car mass should be 60 Kg so the people who are riding the ride will be safe fast and enjoyable.
