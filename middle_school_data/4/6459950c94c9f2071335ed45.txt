I believe to make the most enjoyable roller coaster it needs to have steep drops, high hills, and fast speeds. When all of these things combine it makes for a thrilling and fun ride for everyone.

In Trial #2 in Investigation #3 the car with 60 kg has the highest amount of total energy. This means that the ride will reach the highest speeds out of all of the other masses. This shows that to make a ride more fun it needs to be fast, and adding more mass makes the ride faster and more enjoyable for the rider.

For a ride to be thrilling it needs to have a high initial drop, but this isn't just important for the rider it is also important to make sure that the car will be able to make it over the hill after the drop. Because the car will only be able to make it over a hill if it is lower than the initial drop. This is shown in Investigation #2 when 
 in Trial #2 the hill was higher than the initial drop by .01 (giving it a height of 5.01 meters) the car wasn't able to make it over the hill causing a rollback, due to the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law of physics says that energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can change from PE to KE and back. If the initial drop isn't high enough it would never be able to make it over the hill without extra energy being put into it.  
To optimize fun for the rider it would be recommended to make the initial drop as high as possible and to make the hill just shorter than the drop .So that the car will make it to the end of the track and for it to be an enjoyable ride for the riders. Also to have the highest mass possible would be best as it adds more PE to be converted into KE as it goes down the track, making the ride faster and more fun.
