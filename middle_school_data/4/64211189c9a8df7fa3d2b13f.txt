The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the higher the initial drop, the more energy the car will have. This is important because if I want the car to make it to the end of the tack, it needs to have enough energy. For example, when I tested an initial drop of 5 meters, the total energy was 2443 Joules. But, when I tested lower drops like 4 meters, the total energy was only 1955 Joules. The kinetic and potential energy need to add up to the total energy, (since there's no friction). Consequently, when I decreased the drop height, the potential, kinetic, and total energy decreased, which I don't want. 

My hill height is going to be 4 meters high. Since potential energy turns into kinetic energy, the hill needs to be high enough to create a lot of potential energy at the top that turns into kinetic energy as it goes down. It needs to be high enough, but it also can't be higher than the initial drop otherwise the car won't be able to get up the hill.  When I tested the drop height of 4.25 meters, the potential energy was 2447 joules.

The mass of my car is going to be 60 kilograms because that is the highest it can be. The more mass the car has, the more energy which, as I explained, is necessary to ensure that the car can make it to the end. When a car with more mass is at the top of a hill, it has more potential energy. This will in turn give it more kinetic energy because the potential energy will turn into kinetic energy.
