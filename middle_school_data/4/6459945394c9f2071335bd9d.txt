My roller coaster will be very exciting because it had lots of features and it still works, It will work very well because after each feature it goes downwards which gives it enough speed for the next part of the ride. And because it has an inversion near the end it will slow the ride down so it will be able to make it to the end safely.

My coaster will bring the amusement park much more customers because of how exciting it is, because of how each part of the ride is right after the other so there is never a boring part of the ride,  which will keep people wanting to come to the amusement park.

Also because of how high the ride starts, there will be more PE at the top and more KE at the end of the ride to ensure the cart makes it to the end. Another reason for the very high drop height is that the hills and loops can't go higher than the initial drop since there would not be enough KE for the cart to make it to the end. The mass of the cart should be heavier than most carts because of how you go right into a loop.
