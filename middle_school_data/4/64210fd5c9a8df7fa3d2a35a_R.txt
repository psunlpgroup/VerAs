       When the cart on the roller coaster is at the top of the Initial drop, the PE will be equal to the TE, and the KE will be at 0 because the cart is not in motion. While the cart is moving the PE & KE will change but in this friction less sim, the PE and KE will always add up to the TE at the start and end.
       When I tested the drop height in 3 meters the PE was 1466 joules. When I increased the drop height to 4 meters the PE also increased to 1955 joules. When I decreased the drop height to 2 meters the PE again, decreased to 977 joules. What I've gathered is the higher the drop the more PE.
       When there IS friction, some of your total energy at the end compared to the start, changes. Because energy cannot be destroyed, the energy has to go somewhere else. The energy transfers through friction to other sources such as, sound, thermal, etc.
      Lastly, mass. Mass will not affect the speed of the roller coaster but it will affect how quickly the cart will be able to turn start and stop. Along with height, the mass will help increase the PE & KE at the top of the hill.
