  Dear Gonzales family it was very fun seeing what roller coasters worked and which ones didn't so now I will tell you the best ideas for your roller coasters.

  When adding a hill you want the initial drop height to be greater than the hill height. because with the hill height being larger than the initial drop the roller coaster will not make it over the hill. so if you decide you want a hill just make sure that you make the initial drop height larger.

  Another thing you need to know about is mass if your cart has a smaller mass the less likely it is to get over the hill or through the loop. but when making the carts you should think about making a heavier cart.

My last piece of evidence before i tell you why my roller coaster design is the best is initial drop height. now i'm not an expert but you should have a decently high initial drop because it adds more potential energy which leads to Kinetic energy and it would more thrill if there was more speed.

Now my roller coaster idea this roller coaster will start with a high initial drop which will take it through a loop then go over a hill after the the roller coaster will go up high then go down another big drop. after that the cart goes over two hills then finishes. This would keep riders on the edge of their seat and you would have their applause as the ride finishes with a heavy mass this coaster is possible.

To conclude i talked about adding hills, initial drops and mass to help you build the best possible roller coaster and i hope that you build this roller coaster. with all the right requirements and with this roller coaster your park will be as good as it ever was.
