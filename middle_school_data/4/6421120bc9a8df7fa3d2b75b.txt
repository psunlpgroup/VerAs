The height of the drop has to be taller that the hill because if the hill is taller than the initial drop then the car will not have enough kinetic energy form the initial drop.This is because the potential energy is being converted into kinetic energy and because the total energy will never change the potential and kinetic energy will always be the same value. For example if you had a 4 meter tall drop and a 4.1 meter tall hill the cart could not make it over because the cart only has the energy from the initial drop. If the hill was taller than the initial drop then the cart would not make it because it dose not have enough energy to do so.
