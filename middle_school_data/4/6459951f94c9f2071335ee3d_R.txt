Dear Gonzale's family,  I found out that in my mass and energy data when the car weighed 40, 55, 58, and 60kg 'the initial drop-off height being the same every run (5m)'. The 60KG car had the most potential energy, and kinetic energy, coming in at 2,938 total energy (J) overall. 
When this is compared to a car weighing even 2kg less, the energy goes down to 2480 total energy (J). Which is 458 (j) loss of energy, and 
 I noticed in my data when the total energy was 1,435 (J) the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1,435 (J) but the the KE was 0. By me looking at my data I also realized energy cannot be created or destroyed, as proven above.

When I looked at the bottom of the hill the PE was 1(J), and the KE was 1,434(J), so what I noticed is how when the car is heading down the hill the PE slowly turns into KE. But, when the car is at the bottom of the ride the PE was %99 transferred to KE.

more energy equals more fun for u and ur kids so by making the car weigh more the amount of energy 'or fun' goes up, personally, I would pick the heavier car.
