In order to make the rollercoaster fun and reach the end there have to be 3 factors. The first initial drop has to be huge so that the coaster can make it to the end. the mass of the cart has to be enough to reach the end. and it has to be fun with loops and spins so people ride it.
The first drop should be taller than the rest of the coaster. I know this because in my trials when the initial drop was taller than the rest of the coaster the cart made it to the end. This drop should lead into an immediate loop so riders are excited at the start. Then the loop will keep all the KE from the drop and it could lead into a few turns and spins. Then it should go up another small hill to gain more PE and be able to go into a few corkscrews. Then coming out of the corkscrews it should turn a hard U so the coaster is heading back to the station. It could then go up using its current KE and then drop down into another loop so that the coaster goes out with a bang. Then the coaster can slow down and end up back at the station.
In conclusion, the coaster has all 3 of the main things in it so that people enjoy the coaster, the cart makes it to the end, and it's fun. So when making this coaster make sure to carefully put it together measure everything and keep KE and PE in mind with the initial drop.
