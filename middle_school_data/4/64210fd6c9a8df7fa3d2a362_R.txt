The drop height of the roller coaster should be five meters. So the potential energy can be as high as it can so the car can make it to the end. The cars mass should be sixty kilograms so the car has the maximum Potential energy. Then the hill height should be three and a half meters so the car will make it over with more kinetic energy on top of the hill than the top of the initial drop. Potential energy is related to kinetic energy because the higher the object is the more potential energy there is so when the car starts moving the potential energy transfers into kinetic energy so kinetic energy plus potential energy equals total energy
