The Gonzales family needs the initial drop high so the car can go through the roller coaster. I know this because the data shows that the higher the drop, the higher the PE, the top, and the higher KE and the bottom.
The Gonzales family needs to know that PE and KE added together at the start will equal the total energy at the bottom. PE and KE change throughout the roller coaster, so at the top, there will be 0 kinetic and 100 potential, and as the cart goes down those numbers gradually switch as the car goes down. The conservation of energy says that energy can't be created or destroyed but distributed from different kinds of energy. In the data, the KE at the end will not be the same as the PE at the start but there might be some leftovers and some could have been turned into thermal. 

Relationship of drop height and hill height, the data shows us that as long as the hill is shorter than the initial drop then the car will go over. As we noticed though we saw as soon as we got to the same hill height as the drop then the car would not go over and keep rocking back and forth.
Relationship of mass PE and KE, the more mass an object has the more potential energy object has. KE is the same way Because the cart is pulling down faster and harder to the ground.
