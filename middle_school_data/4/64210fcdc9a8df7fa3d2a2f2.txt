My first recommendation for this roller coaster would be to have an initial drop height of 5 meters. This would lead to more potential energy before it drops, and therefore more kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. I know this because when I tested a 4 meter drop, it had a potential energy of 2150 Joules at the top. Then when I tested a 5 meter drop, the potential energy at the top was 2688 Joules. Since the total energy is just the sum of the kinetic and potential energy, that means having a higher drop will give the coaster more total energy. The total energy in a roller coaster is constantly being passed between kinetic and potential energy. This happens because the Law of Conservation of Energy tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So having more potential energy at the top of the initial drop will allow the cart to move quickly and efficiently throughout the coaster. 
Another recommendation I have is to have a hill height of 4 meters. I think this would be best for the roller coaster because the hill needs to be shorter than the initial drop in order for the cart to make it over. For example, when we tested a hill height of 5 meters, which is the same as the initial drop, the cart did not make it over the hill. But when we tested a hill height of 4 meters, the cart made it over the hill with 1964 Joules of potential energy at the top. This means it has enough potential energy to keep moving after the hill. 
My final recommendation is to have a cart wight a mass of 50 KG. I think this would make the ride fun and exciting because my data shows that a 50 KG cart has  2438 Joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and 2435 Joules of kinetic energy at the bottom. This means that the energy almost entirely switched, which will make it easier for the cart to go over the hill. It also means that the cart will be moving fast and also safely. I think these recommendations would make the best safe and fun roller coaster.
