I would recommend that the Gonzales family try our coaster because it is fun and exhilarating. The reason our coaster will be awesome is the initial drop is pretty high at the height of 3.75 meters. This will create a lot of speed and g force making the ride fun and exciting. You then go up a hill with a height of 2 meters. You will have more then enough kinetic energy to make it to the top of this hill. I know this is true because in my trials. I found that if the initial drop is higher then the hill you will have enough energy to get over the hill. This is shown in trial 1 of adding hills where the initial drop is 3.75 meters and the hill is 2 meters. In this trial the coaster makes it to the end of the track. Where as in trial 3 the initial drop is 3.75 meters and the hill is 4 meters tall causing the coaster to be unable get over the hill. This shows that my teams coaster would make it to the end because the hill is shorter then the initial drop.
