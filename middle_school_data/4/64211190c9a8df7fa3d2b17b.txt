The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. I chose this because it is best to have a tall initial drop height because it will have more potential and kinetic energy used throughout the ride. There will be more potential energy at the top of the initial drop and more kinetic at the bottom (they will transfer). There is a higher amount of potential energy at the top of the initial drop and there is 0 kinetic energy at the top of the drop. The amount of potential energy at the top of the initial drop  transfers to kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop. The law of conservation of energy proves the information in my data and what I have wrote above. The law of conservation states that energy can't be destroyed, but it can transfer between potential energy and kinetic. The initial drop height needs to be taller than all of the other hill height's otherwise it wouldn't make it over the hills. Which that is also proved by the law of conservation of energy. When designing a roller coaster the greater the mass of the coaster the more potential and kinetic energy there will be. Which increase the total amount of energy as well.
