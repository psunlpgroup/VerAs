Height affects potential energy and kinetic energy. The higher you are the more potential energy. Which intern makes the kinetic energy higher as well. 

Potential energy is the same as total energy when there is no kinetic energy. Total energy never changes. When the car is going down the initial drop potential energy is going down because it is moving which means kinetic energy is going up. I can back this up because in my data at the top of the initial drop the potential energy was 2707 at the top. At the bottom it was 1, and the kinetic energy was 2706. But at the top it was 0. This then shows that they all fluctuate and add up to each other and change. 

For the Law of Conservation of Energy. Energy can't be created or destroyed so it just changes. Such as when the car is at the top of the first drop. That is pretty much all the energy that is going to be used throughout the ride. You can't get more because energy can't be created so if you want a lot of energy you need a big first drop. 

Like I stated before, you would need a big drop to use a lot of energy. So if you want to add a hill it needs to be smaller than the initial drop for the ride to work. And if you want even more energy make sure to have a lot of mass in your car. This is because the more mass you have the more kinetic and potential energy you will get. fore example when I used 60 kg in my car the PE was 2933 and the KE was 2930 at the lower part of the initial drop. 

This is why you should use my coaster because I know lots about coasters. It would be an honor to work for you.
