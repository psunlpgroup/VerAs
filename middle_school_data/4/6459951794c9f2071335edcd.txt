Dear Gonzales family 

i have done some research to find out how to make the perfect roller coaster and here are some things I've found to help make the roller coaster fun and safe and here are some of the reasons i have to help you understand.

One of my findings suggests that the initial drop of the roller coaster must be higher than the hill because the law of energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed , so if a hill the is the exact same as the initial drop or higher than the drop the cart wont be able to go over because it wont have enough energy to go over and it will "roll back" and the ride wont finish my trials show this as well on my 3 trial the initial drop was at 5 m and the hill was at  4.5 m and when the cart went through the roller coaster it made it to the end , while on trial two the initial drop and the hill were the same but when the cart went through the roller coaster it did not get over the hill and did not complete the ride.

another one of my findings suggests the ride will need to have the most mass possible and be as high as possible to create the most kinetic energy and potential energy to make the ride as fun and as safe as possible in my research trials , trial 2 had a car mass of 60 kg and the hill was at 5 m the total amount of energy was 2938 J of energy while on trial 3 the mass of the cart was 40 kg and the drop was 5 m but the total amount of energy was 1959.

So with the research i have provided i will continue to make a successfully fun and safe roller coaster for the park .
