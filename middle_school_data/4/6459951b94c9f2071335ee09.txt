Dear Gonzales family,
I herd that you wanted to have a fun roller coaster and I'm going to help.
First you want to make the initial drop(recommended 5 meters) higher then the hill because otherwise the roller coaster would not have enough force to push it up.Also when you have 5 meters high it is usually 2,400 or a little higher.  When you are at the top of the initial drop the PE will always have a higher number then the  KE because the KE will always be zero on the initial drop. Then when your going down the initial drop the PE levels will go down and the KE levels will rise and when your going up the hill the PE levels go up and the KE levels will go down. Also when you have less car mass you have PE and less KE.
