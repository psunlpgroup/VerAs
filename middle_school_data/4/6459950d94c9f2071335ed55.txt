The Gonzales family should make sure to have the initial drop of this fun and safe roller coaster higher than the hills and loops. This is because if the initial drop is higher than the hills and loops, there will be more total energy to go over the hills and loops. But if there isn't enough total energy, the cart will not make it over the hills.

  The Gonzales family needs to make the initial drop higher than the hills and loops so then there is enough total energy to go over the hill and around the loop. For example, in my data on Adding hills, when I set the hill height to 5.0 m and the initial drop to 5.0 m. The cart was not able to make it over the hill because there wasn't enough total energy, PE, and KE. And the Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So setting the height of the hills lower than the initial drop, will provide enough energy. And to have more total energy to get over things, the initial drop needs to be higher than the hills and loops. This proves that the Gonzales family needs to make sure that their initial drop is higher than the hills, so then there is enough total energy to go over the hill. Also, when I set the hill height to 4.75 m. There was enough total energy to make it over the hill when the initial drop height was 5 meters. This shows that even making the slightest change, can stay provide enough energy to make over the hill. Still having it be fun and safe. Also they should make sure the mass of the cart is at 50, so then there won't be any problems with having a heavy cart.

   Overall, I think that the Gonzales family needs to make their initial drop higher than the hills and loops. This is so then there can be enough total energy to make it over the hills and around the loops. So then everybody who rides the ride will have a fun, enjoyable, exciting, and safe experience.
