The height of the initial drop is 5.00 m and it relates to the PE and KE because it corresponds to the loss of speed as KE is transformed into PE. The relation between PE, KE, and TE is that the TE is equal to the negative of the KE, the TE is equal to half of the PE. This affects my ride because the more PE and KE there is the more TE there is to make the ride faster. As the coaster moves down the initial drop height the PE at the top changes to KE at the bottom and keeps changing back and forth as the coaster goes up and down the track. The Law of Conservation of Energy is energy that changes PE to KE and it keeps on changing the energy throughout the ride. The relation between the initial drop height and the hill height is that the PE from the top of the initial drop transforms into KE as it goes down allowing the coaster to go over the hill. The relation between mass, PE and KE is that PE can transform into KE and KE is directly proportional to the mass of the object and to the square of its velocity. While PE is directly proportional to the masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them.
