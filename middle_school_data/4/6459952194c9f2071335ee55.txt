Dear Gonzales family, my roller coaster design is the best yet. I think this because I have the best qualities of all components going into my roller coaster. The height of the initial drop should be the tallest you can make it so that it gathers a lot of energy to make it go faster over the hill. At the top of the initial drop the PE has all of the energy and at the bottom the KE has all of the energy. The PE and KE always add up to the total amount of energy and the most energy makes the cart go faster. Now, for the hill. I believe the hill should be the tallest it can be but not taller than the initial drop so it makes it to the end. When the car moves down the hill it goes faster when the hill is taller to make it more exciting. The PE and KE switch when it moves down the hill. The higher the initial drop, the higher the hill can be, so if you want a low initial drop then the hill would be lower that would not make the roller coaster any fun. Also the mass of the cart should be high around 55 kg because the higher the mass, the more the energy. I learned this from my data because the lowest amount of mass I tried was 40kg and the energy was 1958, but the highest one I did was 60 kg and the total energy was 2936. In conclusion, the top of the initial drop will be 5m, the hills will be 4m, and the mass is 55kg. All my choices were based on my own research and data. This is why you should choose my roller coaster for your theme park.
