Dear Gonsallas, 

Thank you for choosing our company to work on this project for you, we are all very excited to work with you on this project. I’m going to go straight to the point and say I have created a roller coaster design that I think would be safe, fun, and affordable for your guyses budget. The drop height of the design I came up with is 2.5 meters. This is because of all of the potential energy which would be a lot if I increased the height and it would make it unsafe for all of the riders to ride on, and that much force on a roller coaster would be too windy. This is for people with glasses making it unsafe for the glasses to stay on their faces and dose not comprehend well. And kinetic energy at the bottom would be the same way just not too bad and it would feel like your bottom is lifting off your set.  So anyways when potential energy goes down as you go down the hill the kinetic energy increases and then vice versa but when you go up the hill. So we have to have the initial drop higher than the hill cause otherwise the kinetic energy and the potential energy won’t have the right enough energy to make it over the hill. Next, we have to focus on the mass of the car so for the mass of the car it has to be in the middle it can’t be too heavy or it won’t make it over and not too light cause it will be unsafe for all of the riders to ride on. But also as you increase the mass the energy goes up with it. And we can’t have too much energy with it or it will go too fast of course friction has a role in this but we think about that later. For one trial we used 4.26 joles and which was really fast and hard to stop and for one trial we used 1.50 joles and which was too slow and would not be fun for the riders to have fun on.
