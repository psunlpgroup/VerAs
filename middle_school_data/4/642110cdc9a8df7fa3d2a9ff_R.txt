Based on the experiments I have done, I have decided that having the initial drop at 5 is best. This is because an object's gravitational potential energy depends on its height and mass. The heavier the object and the higher it is above the ground, the more gravitational potential energy it holds. Gravitational potential energy increases as weight and height increase.  Potential energy and kinetic energy can be interconverted and the sum of both quantities is equal to the total energy in a system. Potential energy is stored energy and kinetic energy is due to movement. Potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object starts moving. I would have a short hill, it has to be shorter than the initial drop because there isn't enough kinetic energy to get over the top. the initial drop provides all the energy for the ride, if the hill is too tall you won't have enough energy to get over the hill. if there was friction the hill would need to be shorter to be even shorter so energy could be converted or changed to heat. The law of conservation of energy states that when one form of energy is transformed to another, no energy is destroyed in the process. According to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. So the total amount of energy is the same before and after any transformation.
