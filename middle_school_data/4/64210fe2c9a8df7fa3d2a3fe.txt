The initial drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters, because the higher the drop the more PE there is to get it through the rest of the roller coaster. For example when the initial drop height was 3 meters the PE at the top was 1173 joules and 1173 joules of KE at the bottom. However when the drop height was 5 meters the PE at the top was 1957 joules at the top and 1957 joules of KE at the bottom. The PE at the top and the KE at the bottom are the same because of the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed only transform from one form into another. The PE transferred into KE as the car was going down the hill. So the total energy will not change even as the car is moving. 
Also if the initial drop height is higher than it can make it over the hill. If the hill is the same height or higher than the initial drop then the car won't be able to go over because it won't have enough kinetic energy. For example in testing, when the hill height was 3 meters high and the initial drop was 5 meters, the car had 778 joules of KE at the top of the hill and made it over. But when the hill and initial drop were both 5 meters the car's KE at the top of the hill was 0 so it did not have enough energy to make it over. 
However these tests were done without friction so some of the energy would transfer into thermal energy, so you would need a lower hill height and more momentum from the initial drop. Nonetheless the total energy stays the same and the same rules apply, such as the hill height needing to be lower than the initial drop height.
