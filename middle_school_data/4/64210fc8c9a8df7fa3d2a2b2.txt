Dear Mr and Mrs Gonzales, our design team has been working hard for your roller coaster and we have a design. imagine this a 450 ft Drop leading into a underground tunnel leading in to a loop where it leads into a corkscrew and a drop for the finish while going at a speed of 128 KMH. we found this design with a lot of trail and error but we found it.
