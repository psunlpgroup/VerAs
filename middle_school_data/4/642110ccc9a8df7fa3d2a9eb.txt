Hello, here is our roller coaster design.

First we made our initial drop height 5 meters to get as much energy as possible. We have seen that the height is directly related to both PE and KE. So in turn it will directly effect the total energy. Height also effects velocity because they have a direct relationship. The higher the initial drop height the faster the cars velocity will be. We will also use a car mass 60 kg. This will make for more energy in the coaster. That is because mass has a direct relationship with PE and KE. Which directly effects total energy. Now we need to think about friction and how it will effect the roller coaster. Of course the PE at the top of the initial drop will still be the same because the coaster hasn't started moving yet. At the end of the ride the KE will be less that if there was no friction. This is due to the "Law of Conservation of Energy." This law states that energy cannot be destroyed or created only converted. Since there is friction some energy will be converted to thermal energy but the total energy stays the same.
