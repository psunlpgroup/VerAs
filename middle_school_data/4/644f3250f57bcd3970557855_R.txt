Dear Gonzales family.
We have tested our practice and the initial drop will be 5 joules, our hill height will be 4 joules and car mass is 50kg. We have decided this because if the initial drop is 5 joules it will be fun and safe. The hill height will be 4 joules the car will make it over, we noticed the initial drop should be larger than the  hill height. When we tested this the PE was 2190 when we tested it the PE was converting to KE and the KE ended up being 2190. We chose for the car to be 50 kg because its a good mass and fits a good amount of people. The mass will gain energy when it goes down, making it go over the hill with good speed.
