The height of the initial drop will have to be 5 meters so there will be more PE and less KE at the top. 

If you have a higher drop there will be more energy to get the cart to the end of the coaster. 

That way the PE can transfer into KE by the end of the coaster and the more total energy you will have.

The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is the more PE you have at the top the more it will transfer to the amount of KE and the more total energy you will have since your TE is the PE.

As the coaster goes down the drop at 5M the 1955J of PE transfers into KE so you will have 1J of PE at the bottom and 1954J of KE at the bottom.

The relationship between the drop height and hill height is that the hill has to be shorter. So there is more energy to be able to get over the hill
 
If the hill is the same height or taller the cart will not have enough energy to make it over.

The more mass your cart has the more PE and KE you will have so the more total energy you will have at the end of the coaster because it is getting transferred over.

The law of conservation of energy states that no energy is destroyed it just gets transferred.
