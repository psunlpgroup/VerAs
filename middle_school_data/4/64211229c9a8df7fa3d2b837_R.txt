In my teams roller coaster, We have been putting a lot of thought into this coaster to be the best. So we would have 1 hill at 5 (m) and the hill height at 4 (m) because if we were to put the hill a bit taller then the initial drop it would not make it to the bottom of the hill. The car mass would be 50 (kg) so it would be not to heavy but not to light. While messing around with the mass of the car the lower the (kg) is on the car it would seem to go a bit slower. Conservation of energy does not mean saving energy. Instead, the law of conservation of energy says that energy is neither created nor destroyed With the heaviest it seemed to go slow also so i went in the middle. Based on my data with the numbers up top putting the drop at 5 (m) and the car mass at 50 (kg). The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2933 (J). The KE at the top of the initial drop was 0 (J) at the end of the ride the PE at the bottom of the ride was 1 (J). The KE at the end of the ride was 2932 (J), The total energy was 2933. To my data at the start of the initial drop PE was the same number at the total energy at the bottom The total energy of a system is the sum of the potential, kinetic, and internal energies. If i were to change the friction to a different number at the bottom. As the height that a car is dropped from the initial drop increases, the percentage of potential energy lost also increases. Potential energy transforms into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy converts into potential energy and then back again. As an object falls its potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases the decrease in potential energy is almost exactly equal to the increase in kinetic energy.
