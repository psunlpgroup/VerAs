Dear Gonzales family, 

My school has been researching ways to build a roller coaster. Here is my suggestions on how to make a fun and safe roller coaster. The first thing with building a roller coaster is the initial drop of the roller coaster has to be taller than the hill height. This is because if the drop is lower than the hill there will not be enough PE to make it to the end of the ride. 
       Also the higher the initial drop height depends on the PE and KE of the ride. I know this because when I was collecting data while doing the sim the higher the initial drop the more PE , KE and total energy there will be. As the coaster car goes down the hill the PE goes down and the KE starts going up.
