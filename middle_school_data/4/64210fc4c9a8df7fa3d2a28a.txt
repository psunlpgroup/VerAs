We started at a release height of 2 then we tested 3,4 and 5. each time we tested the roller coaster and the greater the height was greater the PE at the top.But the KE at the top was always 0.As the cart went down the hill the PE went down and the KE went up. The energy basically switched so if the PE at the top was 997 J the KE at the top was 0 J then the PE at the bottom was 0 J and the KE at the bottom was 977 J. The total energy is always all the energy added up and PE is energy before the cart goes down the hill and KE is energy after the hill. When we added the hill we learned that the hill always had to be smaller then the first drop or the cart would not make it over the hill.The weight of the cart has a lot to do with if the cart makes it to the finish or not it the cart was heavier it had more energy.
