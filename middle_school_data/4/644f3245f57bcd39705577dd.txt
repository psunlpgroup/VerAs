Dear gonzalas family,

My team and i have worked together and came up with some ideas on what to do for the roller coaster. Unfortunately we were not able to have the hill height higher than the initial drop height, but we think we came up with some very good ideas that will please your customers and keep them coming. 

As i said before, my team and i  did some studies on the hill height being higher than the initial drop height. The reason why we could not do that is because it is not possible in our situation due to the friction and evergy levels. 

Let me break this down, lets say we did have the hill height be higher than the initial drop height. My team tested this happening twice, let me show you the data. The initial drop height was 3.5m and the hill height was 4m. As you can see , the hill height is higher than the drop height. When we tested this the cart did not make it over the hill. The reason the cart did not make it over is because it did not have enough energy.

At the start of the roller coaster (the ID) however many joules of energy we have at the top of the ID is how much energy we have throughout the whole roller coaster. This happens because due to the law of conservation of energy no energy is ever created or destroyed. Since the hill height is higher than the drop height you need more energy to get over it and no more energy is going to be created.
