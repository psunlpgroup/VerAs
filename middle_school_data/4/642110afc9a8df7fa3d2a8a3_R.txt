I think that the height of the initial drop should be 3.5 or 4 because that has been the most successful trial,also because if it is too low it won't be able to make it up the hill.the data shows that there is a direct relationship between the drop height  and PE because the PE goes up as the height goes up.There is a indirect relationship between the KE the PE goes down as the height goes up.Going down the drop the PE goes down but the K goes up.The mass of the car should be 50 because that is not too low or too high because that has shown that it does the best 60 is too high and 40  is too low.The hill height should be between 3-4 because it works the best when the drop height is a little bit bigger than the hill so the car can use the law of conservation of energy.Also the car can accelerate up the hill and drop.The more mass there is the more energy.the relationship between drop height and the hill height is that the drop has to be bigger or the same height as the hill otherwise the car will not make it over the hill.The relationship between KE and PE is a indirect because when the PE at the top of the hill when the cart is going down the PE also goes decreases while the KE increases.The more mass there is the more energy there will be the relationship is a direct relationship because  both increase or decrease.
