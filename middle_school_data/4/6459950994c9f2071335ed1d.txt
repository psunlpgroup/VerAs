The Gonzales family should have a high initial drop, a hill shorter than the initial drop and a heavy car. 

My reason for why there should be a high initial drop is because it increases the amount of potential energy on the ride. When you have a greater amount of potential energy, you will in turn have a greater amount of kinetic energy. Because of the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. This means that increasing the potential energy will make the roller coaster have more kinetic energy as it moves. In "Initial Drop Data" it showed that the tallest drop which was 5m had the greatest amount of energy 2443J.

My reason for why the hill should be shorter than the initial drop is because the car will not make it to the end of the ride. In "Adding Hills Data" my data showed, when my hill was the same height as my initial drop (5m) it did not make it to the end.

My reason for a heavy car is that it increases potential energy. Due to it's higher mass the potential energy rises, this also causes kinetic energy to be greater as when the car moves it's potential energy converts to be kinetic energy as it goes downhill. In "Mass and Energy Data" it shows that when my car's mass was at the highest (60kg) it had 2937J of energy causing it to not stop until the end.

All in all my reasoning and evidence show that the initial height should be taller than the hill height as well as the car should be heavy.
