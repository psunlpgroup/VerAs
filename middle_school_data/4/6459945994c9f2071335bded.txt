I think that our roller coaster is the best design because we have done tests and we have figured out the only way it will make it to the end is that the initial drop has to have the greatest height out of everything. You will not have enuff PE to make it over a hill/loop with a greater height than the initial drop. Another thing that would help the car make it all the way through is more mass. We have done some tests with mass we first tested a car with 40kg its PE was at 1763 then we tested a car at 60kg its PE was 2644 almost 1,000 differences in PE just because of mass. We also did some tests with the initial drop and we tested the height at 2.50M it had a PE of 1222 and then we did another test but the height was at 5.00M it had a PE of 2443. Then we did some tests with hill height we first set the initial drop to 4.50M then we added a hill with a height of 2.50M when the car reached the top of the hill it had 1226 PE and 974 KE which means it was still moving at good speeds and made it to the end. More KE more faster the car is moving then we took a hill with a height of 5.00M and the initial drop is still the same height of 4.50M and when the car was at the top of the hill it had a PE of 2200 and a KE of 5 and the car was not able to make it over the hill because the hill was higher than the initial drop. This just proves that more height more PE more mass more PE the initial drop has to be higher than the hill or I won't make it over the hill. Now this is way I think you should use our Roller Coaster.
