The drop height of my roller coaster will be 5m tall. This is because 5m was the initial drop with the most PE. When I tested the 5m initial drop the PE was 1955 joules. When i decreased the height to 4m the PE deceased to 1564 joules. This initial drop height will optimum for most energy right at the start of the roller coaster drop. 
The hill height will be 4m tall. The hill height will be 4m tall because that was the tallest height with the roller coaster making it over. When I tested the 4m height the cart at the top had 1569 joules of PE and 389 joules of KE. When I decreased the height to 3m then the PE at the top of the hill was 1179 joules. The KE for the 3m hill was 776 at the top. Since the 5m hill didn't work for the cart, the 4m hill will be the choice. The 4m hill had the least amount of energy loss in out friction less environment. 
The weight of the cart will be 60kg because that was the cart with the most PE at the top of the hill. When I decreased the weight of the cart to 50kg the PE was only 2448 joules while the PE for 60kg was 2937 joules. The PE for a cart of 40kg was only 1958 which was the least amount of joules in our tests. This means that when I increase the weight of the cart the PE also increases 
Since energy can't be created or destroyed there would always be the same amount of total energy throughout the coaster. For example when the PE at the top of a coaster was 1564 joules the total energy of the coaster was 1564 joules. 
The total energy and the PE at the start of the coaster are the same. For example when the PE was 1564 joules the total energy was also 1564 joules.  
The relationship between PE and KE is that at the top of the hill there is only PE but as the roller coaster goes through the tracks that PE gets converted into KE. For example when the coaster is at the top of the hill some of the initial PE is turned into KE. When the hill was 4m tall the PE at the top was 1958 joules. At the top of the hill though the PE was 1569 joules and the KE was 389 joules.
