The roller coaster must have an initial drop taller than the hill that way the car can carry enough kinetic energy to get up the hill. If the car does not have enough kinetic energy you will get some bad reviews. for example when we tried to have a taller hill then the car lost all kinetic energy and did not make it to the end however when the hill was any shorter the car would have gotten over. For example in one of the trails the drop height was 4 meters hill height was 3.5 meters. A little bit more on Law of conservation of energy states that all energy you had at the start you will have at the end for example in our trails the car had the same total energy. When the car is going down the hill it turns all the potential energy into kinetic energy (energy in motion).The more mass you have the faster the cart will go making it a more enjoyably experiences for the riders.
