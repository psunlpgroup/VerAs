I think that my design would be the most enjoyable ride for your park. My design has 4 inversions and it starts on a big drop that is guaranteed to give you the most speed. The roller coaster will carry speed because every time you go on an inversion you gain speed. You gain speed by turning the KE into PE and then the PE will turn back into KE giving you enough speed for the ride.

The drop height in my trial was 5.00m this was high enough to provide enough total energy to take you through the ride. The PE at the top of the drop affects the amount of KE you will have at the bottom of the drop.

I also tested the different hill heights and how they would effect the ride. The hill height effects the amount of PE you will have at the top of the hill. The more PE you have at the top of the hill affects the amount of KE you will have by the end of the hill. In my trials 4.01m was the best hill height. This is because you have enough energy to make it up the hill. For example if you have a hill that is the same height as the drop you will not make it up the hill. The height of the hill has to be just right to gain more speed and carry it through the ride. 

The inversions would be 3 loops and one 360 roll the loops would all be different sizes. The first loop would be right after the drop and it would be 3.50m tall and wide. After that there would be a hill that leads into a second loop that is 2.60m tall and wide. There would be a turn after that and on that turn there would be a 360 degree roll. Then there would be one last loop that is 2.00m tall and wide and then the ride would be over.

The car mass would be 60kg because the more mass you have the more speed you will have. The mass affects the PE and the PE affects the KE because when moving down a drop all of the PE will turn into KE.
The more mass you have the more PE you will have which makes the ride faster.
