My roller coaster design would be good. because first you start with a big drop right away which is really exciting but after that there is a loop that make you feel weightless but after that you still have enough speed to go over a hill. 

This would work because in my trial with the biggest drop it had a PE of 2179 Joules which was enough to get through a loop and a hill until the end of the ride. Also because the higher the initial drop is it has 2179 PE at the top but at the end of it it would have the same at the end because it changes from PE to KE which is kinetic energy. Those 2 types of energy effect my roller coaster because you would need enough PE to be able to make it through the roller coaster so it doesn't just stop before it gets up the hill and go to the end.

When the roller coaster moves down the track energy changes because at the top you are not moving it means your storing potential energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be destroyed nor created but it can change from one to the other. meaning when you move from the top of the drop you are now releasing the stored potential energy which is called kinetic energy which is also speed or velocity.

One big component of a roller coaster is the initial drop height and the hill height because when you go off a 2 m drop into a 5 m hill height it doesn't work. because you are not storing enough PE to get over that hill because it requires more energy so to counteract this I make a larger initial drop to get over the obstacles with enough kinetic energy to get to the end of the track.

The amount of energy that the roller coaster depends on 2 things the initial height of the drop and the mass of the cart the more mass the higher PE and KE in cart so the faster you will go to make it more exciting.

This is why the Gonzales family should pick my roller coaster because it can stay consistently fun and safe.
