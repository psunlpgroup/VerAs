The drop height for my roller coaster design is 5.00. Because the higher it is the more energy i get from the drop from the potential energy. This is because The more potential energy i get from the ride, the more force i get for the total energy from the potential energy. when the cart drops down the kinetic energy status rises up. So the amount of potential energy i get the amount of kinetic energy that i have. And the Drop height and Hill height are very similar. It just has to depend on the Height of the height. When the PE drops it decreases because the Kinetic energy comes up and increases upon the initial height drop for PE and KE. and the Total energy will go upon the Potential energy and get close to the same results as PE.  The relationship between the  PE and KE is quite close because potential energy waits until The KE to increase and the PE to decrease. The KE will depend about how much potential energy it gave to the Kinetic energy. For example, when i tested the drop height of 5 meters, the PE was 2216 Joules/ when i decreased the drop height to 4.50 meters, the PE decreased at 2201 Joules. The law of conservation of energy says that energy is neither created nor destroyed. When people use energy, it doesn't disappear. Energy changes from one form of energy into another form of energy. On a roller coaster, energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times over the course of a ride.
