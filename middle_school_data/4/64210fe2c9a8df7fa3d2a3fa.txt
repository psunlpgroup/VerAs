The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. The potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its height above the zero position. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the potential energy was 1173 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 3 meters, the potential energy increased to 1759 Joules. Additionally, on my roller coaster design when the height of the drop was 2 meters, the potential energy was 1173 Joules, and kinetic energy was 0 Joules, but when the roller coaster went down the track potential and kinetic switched. The potential energy was 1 and kinetic energy was 1172, so potential energy changed into kinetic energy, this is because potential energy changes into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy convert into potential energy, and then it repeats in a cycle.
