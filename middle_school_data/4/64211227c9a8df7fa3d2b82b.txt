The height of the initial drop will be very high so that the ride is faster and has more PE that can turn into KE. The total energy will determine how much energy is being used and there will be a high total energy because we want the roller coaster to be fast and fun. And a high starting point so the PE can turn into KE and make the ride fast. When the cart drops down the initial drop it will slowly change the energy from PE to KE. And when the cart goes on the loop as it slows down it will gain in PE from the KE. The loop and hill will have to be shorter than the initial drop (less than 5m high) so that it can make it to the end of the ride. If the loop or hill were as tall or taller the cart wouldn't be able to make it past the top, because the initial drop doesn't give enough energy for the cart. the mass will be a medium amount so then there is enough to go fast but not too little so it's dangerous. And our biggest goal is to make the ride fun but not dangerous. That is our idea so far.
