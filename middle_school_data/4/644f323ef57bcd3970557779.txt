Dear gonzolas family, 

we believe that we found a rollercoaster that works with an ID of 5 meters and a cool loop in the middle that's 4.4 meters and then we end it off with a nice 2-meter drop. 

 We think this will be a good option because it's safe, fast, and exciting. The reason we decided to do a loop that's 4.4 meters is that it just makes it over with the friction and a 5-meter ID. 

Second, we made a small hill to end it just so it would add some more attraction. PE converts to KE as it goes down the ID and up hills/down hills so the energy will go back and forth between KE and PE. The more mass a car has the faster the car will travel.
