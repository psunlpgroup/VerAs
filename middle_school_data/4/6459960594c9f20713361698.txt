     I will be discussing why our teams coaster would be a great addition to your theme park and all the science behind the roller coaster.    
    The Bikini Bottom Adventure pulls you up to the top where the initial drop is. Where you will then be dropped and go up and over a hill. Then at the bottom of the hill you go through a loop you will the come out of the loop and go down two more tiny hills. Then you will go around and finish the ride. The Initial drop will be 5 meters so it can store the max amount of PE. The Hill will be 4 meters so there will be enough KE to make it over the hill. The hill will be high enough so there's enough PE that converts to KE to make it through the loop. The energy converts because of The Law of Conservation of Energy. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. We can see this from the data that is shown. The hill height was set at 4 meters and the initial drop was 5 meters. There was 1965 Joules of PE at the top of the hill and 1462 Joules of KE also at the top of the hill. When they reached the bottom there was 0 PE and 0 KE. This shows that are roller coaster will work because we can make it over the hill. The initial drop also affects the PE and KE. There's 2443 PE at the top and 1 PE at the bottom while KE there's 0 KE at the top and 2442 KE at the bottom. Since our Initial drop is high there will be a lot of PE and KE and TE. This effects our ride greatly it effects how fast we go if we can make it up the hills and if our roller coaster will make it to the end. We also will make our cars have more mass because as we've seen in the data the more mass the more energy it will have. With a Mass of 60 kg it had 2930 KE at the bottom of the drop but a car with 50 kg only had 2432 KE at the bottom so that's why our cars will have more mass. These all are reasons why the Gonzales should pick our roller coaster to add to there theme park.
