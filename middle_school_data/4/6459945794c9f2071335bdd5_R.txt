The Gonzales family should choose my roller coaster design because it's not only exciting but it will also be safe. My roller coaster is going to start with a high drop so energy can be passed through and make the ride fast and fun. Most roller coasters start with a chain to pull them up but my roller coaster will start with an initial drop of 4.0 m. The amount of PE at the top will be 1955 J and the KE at the bottom will be about 1954 J. It won't be too low because if it is, there won't be enough energy for it to go over any of the hills.

 On the topic of hills, my hill will be about 3.52 m high. The height of the hill should always be shorter than the initial drop. If not, the car may not make it all to the end or even over the hill. So the shorter the hill, the more of a chance to make it over. 

My car will have a mass of 55. The PE at the top of the drop will be 1959 J and the KE at the bottom is 1956 J. The total amount of energy at the end will be the same as the PE (1959 J).
