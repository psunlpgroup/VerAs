Through my experiments, I have determined the best possible roller coaster for your theme park. to start the initial drop will be the tallest it can be at 5 meters. This will give us the most potential energy at the top. when we go off of the drop the stored energy will convert to kinetic energy in turn giving us more speed and we will be able to do more loops and hills with the energy we are given off of the initial drop. 
You recently stated that you might want a taller hill than the initial drop. This is not possible without using an applied force to propel you to the top due to the law of conservation of energy. Which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Another variable is the car mass I have determined that the larger the mass of the car the more potential energy and kinetic energy. I suggest a car mass of 50-60 kg so we get more acceleration. potential energy and kinetic energy transforms inversely meaning as we go down the drop the stored energy (PE) gets smaller and gets transferred into energy in use and motion(KE).  also in a frictionless environment, a 5-meter drop will give us the most total energy(TE). TE is the KE and the PE combined.
