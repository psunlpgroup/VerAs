When a roller coaster is at the top of a start hill it has all potential energy and no kinetic energy. When it starts moving it has some potential energy and some kinetic energy. When it reaches the bottom of the hill it has all kinetic energy and no potential energy. When a roller coaster starts on a taller start hill it will have more potential energy than if it starts on a shorter start hill. If a roller coaster car is heavy, it will have more energy than if it is light. If there is no friction, the kinetic energy plus the potential energy equals the total energy. If a roller coaster's start drop is taller than its hill, the car will make it over, but if the start drop is shorter than the hill, the car will not make it over. Our best design had a drop height of 5 meters and a car that weighed 60 kg. It had 2395 Jules of total energy. Since the drop height was tall and the car was heavy, it had more kinetic and potential energy, so it had more total energy.
