A recommendation is to make the initial drop as high as you can and the hill as small as you can. This is  because it well make the roller coaster faster. The coaster we have at the moment is very fast do to how high up the initial drop is compared to the hill. The height of the initial drop should be taller then the hills height because it will make the coaster fast. We know this because the coaster data shows that when at the top of the initial drop there is more PE then there is at the top of the hill. When we have a initial drop height of 5 meters the PE is 2440 and when you get to the top of the hill the PE is 984. When going down the drop the PE degrees and turns into KE then when going up the hill that same KE turns back into PE. The height of the initial drop has to be taller then the height of the hill. This is because the coaster car has friction and that friction makes the coaster car not have enough KE to get up the hill. The more mass you have on the coaster car the better. This is because when going down the drop or hill it is going to go fast do to the gravity acting on it is more because of the mass it is easier to pull it down the drops.
