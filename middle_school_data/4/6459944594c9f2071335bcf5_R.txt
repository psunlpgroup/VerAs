Dear, The Gonzalez Family. 

Hello Gonzalez Family, in this letter I will show you how to make the most fun and scariest ride for your park. More people will be attracted to your park because of this coaster.

I think the best roller coaster we could build would be a roller coaster with three hills and two inversions. Both inversions would come after the two of the hills, which would add extra fear because if the coaster has speed while also being upside down it would make riders have fun. The hills would be all in different parts of the ride. We would need to have are hill heights shorter than the initial drop, there would be enough potential energy to get over all hills and inversions. The initial height would be 3.60 meters tall, the weight of the coaster would be 60kg to give the most speed through the ride. The more weight gives the ride more speed as I learned from my data.

The best way to make a roller coaster is to have people have fun and be feared by the coaster. To make people scared we should make fast speeds which could be made by weight of the coaster and height of the ride. Another way to make fear is to add inversions, if you combine inversions and speed people would have enough fun to ride on the coaster again. The roller coaster would be the most fun and scariest in your park. These lines would be very long since itâ€™s a long coaster, so I think the best way to counter the long lines would be to have two coasters going at the same time. The second coaster would start when the first coaster gets to the third hill, this adds safety and shorter lines.

The best way to make the coaster safe is to make sure we have the right speed. I learned from my data that the more height causes more speed, the fastest initial height I found while still being safe was 3.60m tall. This height would give the fastest speeds possible while being safe.
