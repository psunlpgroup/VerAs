     I think the initial drop height for the roller coaster should be 5 meters. I think this because the initial drop height and kinetic energy have a direct relationship. A  direct relationship is when both variables increase or decrease when one of the variables is increased or decreased. 

     Next, I think the hill height should be 4.8 meters because the car should have just enough energy from the initial drop to make it over the hill. The car will have just enough energy to make it over the hill because the hill is just less than the initial drop height, and for hills to work in a roller coaster they have to be less than the initial drop height. Also since potential energy and kinetic energy have an inverse relationship once the car gets to the top of the hill. Most of its kinetic energy will get converted into potential energy at the top of the hill which will cause it to get then converted back to kinetic energy on the way down. The reason the energy keeps getting converted is because of the Law of The Conservation of Mass, which states energy can not be created or destroyed. So the total energy will remain the same throughout the ride.
     Finally, I think the mass of the car should be 60kg. I think this because mass and kinetic energy also have a direct relationship, meaning the car will go faster.
     The few paragraphs are my opinion on how the roller coaster should be.
