The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.This is because the higher the height the more mass and the more mass is more KE. For example when I tested the drop height of 2 meters the PE was 1172 Joules. When I tested 5 meters it was 2930 Joules.When I increased the drop height to 5 meters the PE increased to 2930 Joules.



Whenever you add more mass you get more PE and total energy.With more mass means the roller coaster will have more potential to go faster and adds more thrill.The relationship between drop height and hill height is that the drop height has to be bigger than the hill or the coaster won't go over the hill.

When I found the total energy there was a certain amount of energy for PE and no energy for KE.I added up PE and KE and it should equal the initial amount of PE at the start.And it never transfer because there is friction.That is how you get your total energy.

The law of conservation stats that no energy can be destroyed or created just transferred from one to another.

Thank you Gonzalez family for reading my essay on why you should buy my coaster.
