Dear Gonzales Family, 

Initial drop:

We are going to set the ID at 4.5m, so it's fun but a little scary and still somewhat safe. If we make the ID at 4.5m it'll be fast. The PE at the top of the ID 2198j, and the KE 2199j at the bottom caused the TE to come out to 2199j.

Hill height:

We are going to make the HH 2.75m, making the PE at the top of the hill 1351j and the KE at the top of the hill 362j making the TE 1714j. Which makes it successful in going over the hill. Letting it go for the end of the ride.

Mass of car:

 We are thinking of putting the car mass as 45kg so it is not too fast. We did that so that the ride is not as fast because of the height of the ID. That causes the PE at the top of the ID to be 1326j. Also making the KE at the bottom of the ID the same and the TE the same. Now that we believe the roller coaster is at its best-looking blueprint we will start building it in a couple of weeks.
