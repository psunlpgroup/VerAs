Rollercoaster Essay #1
Dear Gonzales family, 
The engineering company that I work for believes that the drop height of the rollercoaster should be 5m tall. And the hill height should be 3m tall and the mass of the car should be 50kg.
	
I believe that the drop height of the rollercoaster should be 5m tall because. When I had the drop height at 4.25m the PE was 2079j then when I had the drop height at 5m the PE was 2443j so when there is more height there larger the PE is bigger and the more fun.
