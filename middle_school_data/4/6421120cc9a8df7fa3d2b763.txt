Hello Gonzales Family, 
         We have conducted many tests to ensure your roller coaster will be safe and fun. To begin, we have understood the relationships between potential and kinetic energy and how they will relate to the height of your roller coaster. The height of your roller coaster should be greater than the height of any loops and hills you would like to add. We noticed in our experiments that PE and KE will always equal the TE (Total energy) while going down the drops and throughout the ride. This means that at the top of the initial drop, PE will equal the TE, and KE will be 0. As the cart rolls down the hill, the potential energy will convert into kinetic energy, gathering speed. If/ when you add a hill, the cart's KE will decrease and the PE will increase forcing the cart upwards. This is where the Law of Conservation of Energy comes in as energy cannot be created nor destroyed. As the cart is gaining potential energy from kinetic energy, the total energy is not changing so in order for the cart to make it up the hill, the hill height must be lower than the initial drop height.  
          Mass ties into the speed of the cart as well. The cart with the greatest mass during our tests also had the greatest speed. This means you should choose a cart with a heavier mass to increase the amount of PE at the top of the hill, which will then transfer to KE when gathering speed. If you are ever wondering about the equation to find KE or PE, your can follow these. PE=m(mass)x g(gravitational pull or 9.8)x  height of the drop. KE is found by the equation KE=.5(m)x (velocity x velocity).  
          Thank you for having us help with your roller coaster!
