Dear Gonzales family, 

were going to set the id height for your roller coaster were going to put it at 3.5m. We will put the hill height at 3m because if there is a little amount of friction it will make it over to the end. We will put the cart mass at 50kg it’s not too heavy and it’s not too lite so we think that’s the best mass for the cart to be. For example, when me and my group tested the drop height of 3.5 we got pe was 1714 joules. When I increased the drop height to 4.0m the pe increased to 1958. 

Sincerely, MSR.S class
