Dear Gonzales family Newtonâ€™s Law co has found the drop height of my roller coaster design. 3.5 meters because of the state of the relationship between height and energy for example when I tested the drop height of 3m, the PE was 15kg J. When I increased the drop height by 2 meters the PE increased.
