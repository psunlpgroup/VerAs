The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4 meters. This is because the more height there is, the more PE there will be at the top, and the more KE there will be at the bottom. For example, when we dropped the coaster from 2 meters, there was 977 joules of potential energy at the top, and 976 joules of KE at the bottom. When we dropped the car from 3 meters, there were 1,466 joules of PE at the top and 1465 joules of KE at the bottom. This shows that the higher up the initial drop starts, the more total energy there will be. The amount of total energy didn't change at all. Energy can convert into a different kind of energy, but it can't be created or destroyed. Because PE is reliant on height, the PE went down as the car moved down. However, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, all that energy got converted into KE. As the PE went down, the KE went up. The total energy, however, didn't change at all. Because total energy is just all the different types of energy added up, the total energy stayed the same this entire time. I think that the hill should be 3 meters. I think this because we want the hill to be tall so that it's exciting for whoever is riding the roller coaster, but we can't make the hill as tall as the initial drop. Whenever we made the hill as tall or higher than the initial drop, there wasn't enough energy for the car to make it to the end of the ride. If we make the hill smaller than the initial drop, then the car will have enough energy to make it to the end of the ride. I think that the mass of the car should be 50 kilograms. The more mass the car has, the more energy it will have. When we had a car with a mass of 40 kilograms, it had a total energy of 1,958 joules. When we had a mass of 50 kilograms, the car had a total energy of 2,449 joules. This shows that the more mass the car has, the more exciting the ride will be, since the energy it has will make the car go faster.
