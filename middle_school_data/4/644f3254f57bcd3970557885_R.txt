         Rollercoaster Essay #1
 Dear Gonzala family

Youâ€™ll be happy to know that I have done all the math and science for the coster. And the drop height of my coster design is 5 meters.

When I tested 5 meters for the ID, the PE was 1613J. When I increased the drop height from 2 to 5 meters the PE was 977J and went up to 2443J. And the KE at the bottom

For the hill height, I decided to have the height be 3.5 meters, the PE is 1714J. As I was testing which height would be the best I changed it from 2 to 3.5 meters the TE was 170J and that went up to 1714J so for the hill height I think 3.5 would be the best.

The car mass should be 60 because when I was testing the best test for the car mass 60 went the fastest and the PE was 1613 another test was 50 the PE was 1345.

If I have the ID which is 5 The Hill height which is 4 and the car mass which is 60 in my opinion it makes the most fun coronation will equal 1613.

The mass of the car is 60 will make the car go faster and the faster the car is the more fun the coster will be.
