Dear Mr. and Ms. Gonzales,

My suggestion for your roller coaster would be to make its drop height high. Making its drop height high would not only give it time to build velocity but also let you add more loops or hills to the track after the drop. The velocity would increase because the higher the initial drop height, the higher the amount of potential energy there is. Potential energy transfers into kinetic energy as the car drops from the initial drop height because of the Law of the Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed, so the potential energy becomes kinetic energy. If you decide to add a hill, remember that the hill height must be lower than that of the initial drop because energy can't be created, the car won't gain enough energy to make it over any hills larger than the initial drop. Also note that the mass of the car will be a factor in the amount of total energy there is. A heavier car gains more potential energy than that of a lighter car. This is because of gravity and the velocity the heavier car gains. In the end, the choice is yours, but I would recommend that if you want a faster coaster, make the car weigh more, but if you want it to be a little slower, make the cart a bit lighter. Most importantly, make sure you make the drop height high and never make the hills taller than the initial drop height.
