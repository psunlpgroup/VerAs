Dear Gonzales family 

Our engineering company has designed a safe and exciting roller coaster for your family. We found a safe drop height which would be 3m.  This is a good drop height because the higher the drop height the higher the Total Energy (TE).  For example, when we put the hill height at 3m the TE was 1435J. When I decreased my drop height to 2.50m, the TE also decreased to 1221J.  We found a safe hill height for your roller coaster which would be 2.25m. When we were doing the hill height was a little smaller because we don't want to get stuck after the loop. Also, the initial drop height needs to be higher than the hill height because friction would cause it to lose energy and the initial drop would cause it to lose PE and KE. For example, it did not go over when I put the drop to 2.50m and the hill to 3m.  When I decreased the hill height to 2m it went over. We found a safe car mass which would be 60 kg. The reason we think this will be a good car mass for your roller coaster is that when we put it at 60  kg the car went over when we decreased it to   40 kg it went over but slower and we want the roller coaster to be safe and exciting.We hope that you pick our company.

Thanks,
