When I was finished testing different heights, masses, friction, lengths, and energy. I have come to the conclusion that you should have the initial height should be 4.35m, because when the height of the hill was 4.35m the potential energy of the drop started off as 2108joules. Then when the car hit the bottom of the hill the potential energy converted into kinetic energy. But in almost everyone of my tests there was at least 1 potential energy was left, except the kinetic energy ended as 1659joules. Then the total energy was the same amount of potential energy at the top of the initial drop height. Which means whatever the initial drop for Potential energy is, the total energy is most of the time the same number. Next in my data the energy from the cart going down the hill was never created or destroyed but transferred to a different energy during the moving process. My follow up of the conclusion is when the release height was higher than the hill, the cart was able to get over the hill. So the hill height needs to be lower than the initial drop, or the cart won't be able to get over the hill. Also the mass of the car plays a big role in how much energy a roller coaster has. So what I'm trying to say is the more mass the car has the less total energy there is. Lastly I have come to the conclusion that the inital drop should be 4.35m, the hill height should be 2m, and the mass of the car should be 45kg.
