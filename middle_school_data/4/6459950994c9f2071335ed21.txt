If the height of the initial  drop is as high as it can get pe will always be higher while ke on the other hand will always be lower at the height or the drop no matter how high up the initial drop might be.Getting onto the second question if there isnt any pe the cart wont be able to go down which is impossible think of it as a apple.Apples need potential energy to fall the higher a apple is the more  energy it has.Third question the pe at the top of the intial drop is more then when it goes over the hill because theres alot of pe being used when it going down that hill but when it has to go over a hill it slows down a little bit because like i said before the more high up a object is the more potential energy it has.So with that pe at the very top of a drop will be more then going over a hill.Thats also the relation between initial drop height and hill height explained.Now the relation between mass pe and ke the more mass a cart has the more pe it will have because a heavier object builds up more pe proof of this is in my data exmaples are when i did 50 40 46 60 with 60 having the most pe 2938 and 40 having the least pe 1959.
