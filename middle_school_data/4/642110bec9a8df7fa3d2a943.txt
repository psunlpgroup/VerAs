Hello I have some recommendations for you the first one is make your initial drop higher than your hill because the higher the initial you drop is the higher your potential energy is and you want potential energy to make your roller coaster finish. My best design so far has 2.60 Hill height, 2137 PE top of initial drop, 0 KE top of initial drop, 1279 PE Top of hill, 857 KE Top of hill and 2137 Total Energy. I made the Initial drop high because Initial drop and PE have a direct relationship.
