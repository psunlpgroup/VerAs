The higher of the roller coaster would increase energy because you would gain more velocity on a higher drop. At the top of the drop there will be PE and no KE but at the bottom of the drop all PE will get transferred in KE. When you are up on a hill the most energy you can get from the drop is in the PE but when you go down the hill as the energy is increasing the PE is transferred into KE. The law of conservation states that energy can't be created nor destroyed like when PE changes to KE. The drop height needs to be higher then the hill height or is will not have enough KE to get over the hill. The more mass of a roller coaster the more energy it has when it goes down the hill because it can reach a higher velocity.
