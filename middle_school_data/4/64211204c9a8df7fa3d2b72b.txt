I recommend that the Gonzalez family use a very tall drop because this creates the most total energy and also makes the ride the most fun. There will be a lot of potential energy at the top of the drop and 0 kinetic energy. As the car goes down the hill the PE will convert to KE and if there is friction there will be some of the total energy turns into thermal. Then at the bottom of the drop, there will be 0 potential energy and the rest will be kinetic and some thermal if there is friction. But the total energy will always stay the same according to the law of conservation of energy because energy can not be lost just changed into different forms of energy. This means PE and KE will always equal the total energy if there is no friction. Although the drop is high the hill cannot be too high because if the hill is higher than the drop the car will not make it over the hill. This means the Gonzalez family needs to make sure the hill height is less than the drop and maybe even lesser if there is friction. Not too less because the roller coaster is more fun when the car pauses before it goes down the hill. For the car, I recommend the Gonzalez family use a higher mass. According to my data at 60 kg for the cart mass, there was more total energy than 40 kg when there was no friction and more energy means it's more fun. Also more mass in the cart means you can fit more people on the roller coaster.
