The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This made the PE at the top 2932 joules and the KE at the bottom 2930, but if i make the drop height shorter the joules will lower. The total energy for that trial was 5864 joules. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 1173 joules. The total energy for that was 2545 joules. As you can tell the first trial's total energy was much greater than this one because of the release height. The PE occurs at the top of the initial drop and hill, right before its about to go down. And the PE turns into the KE when its going down the hill it transforms energy. That shows what the law of conservative energy states, energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be converted from one type of energy to another. The starting drop height has to be higher than the hill height or else the cart on the roller coaster won't make it to the end because there wont be anymore energy. The more mass, the more energy.
