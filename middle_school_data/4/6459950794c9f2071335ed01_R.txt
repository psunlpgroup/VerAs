Dear, Gonzolaes family.
I have some ideas for your roller coaster so we can make it fun and safe.
so my first recommendation, is that the initial drop should be bigger than all the other hills. 
 otherwise, the cart won't make it I think this because the energy isn't enough
 to go over a taller hill since the energy level and potential goes down as the cart comes up. 
and we should have the cart as heavy as it can be because the heavy cart will hold more energy.
