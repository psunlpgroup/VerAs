        I would recommend starting the rollercoaster with a taller initial drop compared to the hill height. This provides more potential energy that will continue throughout the ride. The hill always has to be smaller than the initial drop so that the car can make it up the hill as well as down. The reason behind this is that energy transfers throughout the ride and to make it last you have to have a larger amount of potential energy at the beginning than at the hill. The potential energy is transferred to kinetic when set in motion (in this case, as it goes down the hill) since energy cannot be created. The potential energy added to the kinetic energy shows the total energy. An example would be adding potential energy at the top with kinetic energy at the top.
        I would suggest building enough energy by having the initial drop set at 4 meters. This would cause the potential energy to be very high at the beginning. Then the energy would be transferred to kinetic energy that lasts throughout a 3.75-meter hill. I would recommend that the mass be 50 kg because then it is not dangerous to ride, considering that the mass contributes to the energy. The total energy would end up being 1,952 joules.
