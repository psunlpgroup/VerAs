To make the Gonzales family's roller coaster as exciting and safe as possible, there are a few things to keep in mind.
First, the higher the initial drop, the more potential energy will be stored. Therefore, a steep (but still safe) initial drop is recommended so that the coaster can keep going and make it through the entire ride without stopping.
A steeper initial drop helps ensure that the roller coaster can keep going because of the energy transfer between potential and kinetic energy, and thermal energy with the friction factor. When the car goes down a hill or the initial drop, the potential energy it started with turns into kinetic energy. As it goes up a hill. it is transferred back into potential energy. The total energy stays the same because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. However, some energy will be lost because of friction. To make sure the cart has enough energy to make it to the end, a steep initial drop is recommended.
The hill height needs to be shorter than the initial drop height for this reason. Since energy cannot be created, a higher hill than a drop will mean the car does not have enough energy to get over it. Therefore, the hill cannot be higher or equal in height to the initial drop.
In addition to these recommendations, the car's mass also has an effect on the roller coaster. The greater the mass of the car, the more total energy the car will have. This is because the equation for potential energy is PE=mgh, mass, times acceleration due to gravity, times height. However, if the mass of the car is too great, it will be difficult to start down the initial drop and will be slower throughout the ride. I recommend a lower mass of the car for these reasons.
In conclusion, there are a few factors to keep in mind when constructing this roller coaster that could affect the excitement and safety of the ride.
