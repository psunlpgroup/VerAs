I think the initial drop height for the roller coaster should be 5 meters. I think this because the initial drop height and kinetic energy have a direct relationship. A  direct relationship is when both increase or decrease when one of the variables is increased or decreased. 

Next, I think the hill height should be 4.8 meters because the car should have just enough energy from the initial drop to make it over the hill, making the ride more exciting. The car will have just enough energy to make it over the hill because the hill is just less than the initial drop height, and for hills to work in a roller coaster they have to be less than the initial drop height.

Finally, I think the mass of the car should be 60kg. I think this because mass and kinetic energy also have a direct relationship, meaning the car will go faster, making the ride more exciting.

The few paragraphs are my opinion on how the roller coaster should be.
