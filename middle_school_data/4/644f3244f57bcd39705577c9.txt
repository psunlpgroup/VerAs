Rollercoaster Essay #1

Dear Gonzales family. I am here for me and u to talk about your company. We will talk about Id, Pe, Ke and Te. If the id is 4 hh is 3 car mass 40 as the id increases pe will increases and Ke will stay the same on tell the cart goes down the hill pe decreases and Ke increases. 

Now we will talk about Pe, Ke, Te if it was like this in 1721 j if the pe went down all will go down.
    The id height has to be bigger than the hill height and it will go over the smaller hill but if the Second hill is bigger than the first hill it will not go over. If the id and hh are the same and the car is too Heavy it will not go up.
