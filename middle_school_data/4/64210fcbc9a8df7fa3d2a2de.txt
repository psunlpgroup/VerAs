Our initial drop would have to be bigger than our hill height so the coaster could make it to the end. If the hill height is taller than the initial drop it would not make it to the end and it would be unsafe to our riders. From the initial drop our cart worked nicer when it had a higher car mass so a heavier cart will be beneficial. because of the PE being higher than the others, that means the car can go faster and keep the momentum so its safe and a blast to be on!. The PE of the car at the top of the initial drop was 2,445 J because it hadn't moved yet, and the PE at the bottom was 2,444 J because it had moved. then still had energy (momentum) to keep going to get to the end. The mass and energy data with the PE and KE were very similar and I think that will help our ride be fun and safe. with a smaller hill height the more momentum and the higher we can make the next hill because of all the PE to keep going. with all of this combined i think we will make a great coaster.
