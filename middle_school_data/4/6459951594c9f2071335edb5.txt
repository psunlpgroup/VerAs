Dear Gonzales family I will be telling you about my research on roller coasters. My roller coaster is and will be the best because it will start from up high at 5.00 meters. Because from there you can get the most PE and it the weight will be 60kg. Because then the PE at the top of the first drop will have  2938J of PE and as it will go down that PE will get transferred to KE But th amount of total energy will always stay the same. Because by the law of conservation of energy is energy can not be created or destroyed.

The KE at the bottom of the first drop will be The same as the PE at the top of the first drop. The PE as the coaster car goes down the the drop the PE will diminish so than the KE will climb back up. As it goes back up the hill the PE increases and the KE diminishes. Also the drop height of the first drop will have to be higher than the following hill other wise it will not make it back up the following hill.
