I believe 5 meters is the best initial drop for forming the most kinetic energy. From my experiments, 5 meters created the most potential energy with 2445 Joules at the top which transferred to 2444 Joules of kinetic energy at the bottom. I believe that 3 meters is the best hill height for moving the car up a hill while maintaining kinetic energy. From my experiments, 3 meters formed 1472 joules of potential energy and 974 joules of kinetic energy. When the car moves up the hill it transfers kinetic energy from the initial drop height to potential energy going up the hill, and back to kinetic at the bottom of the hill. The hill height can't be higher than the initial drop height otherwise the car would not make it up the hill. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, so we cannot create any energy for the car. I believe 60 kg is the best mass, from my evidence 60 kg formed the most total energy with 2932 Joules. The more mass an object has the more energy it has.
