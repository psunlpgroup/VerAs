Dear: Gonzales Family
My company and I have come up with a plan to get your roller coaster started. We decided that the I'D height for your roller coaster would be 4m. Your hill height would be 2.75m. Your car mass will also be 54kg. Here are a few examples of trials of car mass that could work out. In trial 1 the car mass was 40 units and the PE was 1564J. In trial 2 the car mass was 50 units and the PE was 1958 J. Trail 3 the car mass was 55 units and the PE was 2151J.
