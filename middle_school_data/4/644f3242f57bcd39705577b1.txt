Dear Gonzales family, I have found a way to drop height and mass from my work. My team and I have found a way to find fun and safe for you. I tested my design with loops and a hill that will make your riders have fun for some people. Ok, time for the height of the drop my team and me found that the drop height would be 3.00 and the loop height would be 2.00 and the hill height would be 2.00 at the top of the pe should be different at the bottom the same number but in ke, not pe
