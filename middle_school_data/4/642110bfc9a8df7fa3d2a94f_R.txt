My roller coaster design has an initial drop of 5m and a hill of 4.99m because more height equals more PE relative to mass and more speed (KE). I also want the feeling for riders that the coaster is going to start sliding backward and then it makes it over bearly since the hill height can't be larger than the initial drop. If the roller coaster is going faster and on a sharper hill, then the roller coaster will be more exciting. I will also have my roller coaster be 60KG for more TE, and therefore more PE and KE because TE is the limit on PE and KE, I want as much of it as I can get. Since we have no friction, total PE and KE will be higher. PE turns into KE as we go down the initial drop, and then KE turns into PE as we go up the next hill, these energies are capped by TE and demonstrate the law of conservation of energy.
