My proposal is this: you allow my team to give you an idea that could save your business and open a new attraction to your park. My team has been working on this idea for a while now and we think you'll like it, it is called the Top Thrill Dragster. It involves science, technology, and physics and it will be able to make it to the end with pure thrill in the customer's eyes.

 Our starting height of 4.5 m and car mass of 52 kg, making the PE at the start 2298 joules, this will make sure it will always make it to the end of the ride even with a hill in the middle of 4.25 m. With 2298 joules of PE, that changes to KE, when going down the hill PE transfers to KE because it has nowhere else to go. The total energy of the ride being 2298, this does not change because of the law of conservation energy stating "energy cannot be created nor destroyed." Even though PE and KE might change, this does not affect the total energy. The mass of the car, being 52 kg, makes it so it can make it over the hill because, the more mass you have, the more energy you have. 

And that concludes this proposal, I hope you take it into consideration, best of luck.
