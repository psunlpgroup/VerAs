Dear gonzales family, 
 My company and I think that the drop height should be 	5m, the hill height should be 4m and the car mass should be 60kg. We found that energy could neither be created nor destroyed. As the car goes down the drop, ke increases and pe decreases, but pe stays the same throughout the course.  After collecting data, I found that when you make the drop height higher, the pe will increase as well. Increasing the chances of it getting to the end. I know this because when the height was 3m the pe was 1466j. when we increased the height to 4m the pe was 1955j, when we increased the height to 5m the pe increased to 2443j. I feel like having the highest drop possible will make the rollercoaster more fun.
I think the hill height should be 4m because I found that if the hill is the same height or higher than the drop, the car will not make it to the end, but I still want it to be intense enough. I know this because when the drop height was 3.5 and the hill height was 3.5 the car was not able to get over the hill. I found that pe is greater than ke at the top of the hill, but the pe and ke together still make te.
I think the car mass should be 60kg. Because the bigger the mass, the more pe can be stored in the car, making it more likely to make it to the end. I know this because when we increased the mass from 40-60 the te increased from 1075-1612.  All of these reasons are why I think that the drop height should be 5m, the hill height should be 4m and the car mass should be 60kg.
