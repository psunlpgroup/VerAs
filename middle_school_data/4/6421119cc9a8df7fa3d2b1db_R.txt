      Dear Gonzales family, I would like to talk to you about how the higher the release height your roller coaster starts with, the more initial potential energy it will have. For example, if your roller coaster release height is 2 meters, the potential energy will be 977 Joules. If the release height is 5, the potential energy will be 2443 and the kinetic energy will be the same as the initial potential energy at the bottom of the drop. All of this added up will create the total energy and make the ride faster.

     When your roller coaster cart moves down the hill, the energy in the potential energy converts to the energy of kinetic energy. This relates to the Law of Conservation of Energy which states that when one form of energy is transferred to another, no energy is created or destroyed. For example, my initial drop would have to be higher than the hill for it to successfully make it over the hill. For example, when my initial drop height is 3.5 and my hill height is 2 it would completely make it over the hill. When my initial drop height is 3.5 and my hill height is 5 it will not completely make it over the hill. As you can see Gonzales family, using this science, our roller coaster can be a great addition to any theme park.
