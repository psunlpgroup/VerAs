The height of the initial drop relates to potential energy and kinetic energy, because the higher the initial drop the more potential energy there is. Also At the top of the initial drop there is no kinetic energy. At the bottom of the initial drop all of the potential energy is changed to kinetic energy.

The relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy and total energy is, total energy is kinetic energy and potential energy added together. The more energy there is the larger total energy will be. Energy can't be added or taken away energy changes to other forms of energy.

Changes in potential energy and kinetic energy going down the drop are the farter down the drop the more kinetic energy there is. If you are in the middle of the initial drop, there will be equal potential energy and kinetic energy. Also when the cart just starts going down the drop the majority of energy will be potential energy.

The law conservation of energy states energy can't be gained or lost in a closed system. Instead energy is transformed to different types of energy. For example while going down the initial drop potential energy is being transformed to kinetic energy.

The relationship between drop height and hill height is, the hill can't be greater or equal to the height of the initial drop. Otherwise the car won't make it over the hill. If the hill is lower than the initial drop the car will make it over the hill.

The Relationship between mass and kinetic and potential energy is, the greater mass at the more potential energy at the top of the initial drop. If the is less mass there will be less kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop.
