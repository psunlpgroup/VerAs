hey gonzales family after hearing you guys are wanted to  make a new roller coster i wanted to help you guys. you need to have the most PE at the initial drop, the more KE you have after that the faster and longer your roller coster will go. you can not make a roller cost that has more PE then the inital drop. the more hight you have the more potential energy you have. your total energy should be equal to or less than the starting energy. the more mass you have the faster the roller coster can go. more mass equals more energy.
