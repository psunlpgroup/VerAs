After running multiple tests so far, I would have many recommendations to make to your new roller coaster when being built. First when making it make sure that when you create hills or loops the height of them is shorter than the hill/drop before by at least a few feet. This is because when the car drops down the hill its energy transforms from Potential energy at the top to Kinetic energy as it moves downward.the reason you need to have a smaller second hill is some of the energy is turned to thermal energy taking it away from both PE and KE leaving less to work with. my data shows that the lower the hill after initial drop height is, the better chance the car has of making it over. For example when the hill height was at 4 (the same height as the hill) it didn't make it over but at 3.5 it did.The law of conservation of mass states that energy can't be gotten rid of or created in a situation. Therefore total energy will always be the same but now the energy that got taken away from PE and KE you can no longer use to go up hills.  If you want to still make your roller coaster thrilling you just have to make sure your initial drop height is high making the potential energy and total energy be higher.  It would also help to make your car mass higher since data shows that if the mass is higher so is the PE and KE.
