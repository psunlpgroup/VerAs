One of the best ways to have fun on a roller coaster is with a hill. Since the top let's say it's 4m up and the hill is 1m you're gonna go down fast. Then come back up due to there being a hill to go back down for a little more enjoyable. Now you might be asking how this makes sense let me tell you... With the height aka internal drop being 4m up how might this change the PE and KE of the ride... With more height, there will be a bigger drop since let's say 4m normally with no hill, and the weight of the car is 50kg the data will be. 1956J up the top of the initial drop and when it goes down it will be the same 1956 but in KE due to the law of conversation of mass. A relationship between PE and KE is that You have KE when moving down and when you're moving up to the original height your drop off of the PE is going up so it's like a reverse relationship. The total energy is formed with the PE or height whatever you wanna call it. When the car is placed on top of the height of the hill that will become your total energy or PE.  Height and PE aren't the same but can tie into each other. The more Height you have on a building can produce more PE due to the fact the car will go faster down since it has that velocity to travel down to the bottom.
