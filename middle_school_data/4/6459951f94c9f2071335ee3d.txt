Dear Gonzale's family,  I found out that in my mass and energy data when the car weighed 40, 55, 58, and 60kg (with the initial drop-off height being the same every run). The 60KG car had the most potential energy, and kinetic energy, coming in at 2,938 total energy (J) overall. When this is compared to a car weighing even 2kg less, the energy goes down to 2480 total energy (J). Which is 458 (j) loss of energy, and more energy, equals more fun for u and ur kids so by making the car weigh more the amount of energy 'or fun' goes up, personally, I would pick the heavier car.
