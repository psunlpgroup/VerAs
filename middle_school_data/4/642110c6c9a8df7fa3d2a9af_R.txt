When height increases, so does potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom. For example, when the initial drop is 5 meters the potential energy at the top is 2443 joules. At the bottom of the 5-meter drop, the kinetic energy is 2443 joules. When the initial drop's height decreases to 2 meters, at the top potential energy is 977 joules. At the bottom of the 2-meter drop, the kinetic energy is 977 joules. Based on this, height, potential energy, and kinetic energy have a direct relationship. When mass increases, so does potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom. To explain, when the car mass is 40 kilograms the potential energy is 1955 joules. When the car's mass is 60 kilograms, the potential energy is 2933 joules. Making the relationship between mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy direct. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it transforms. This is important because it explains the inverse relationship between kinetic and potential energy. For example, at the top of a drop the potential energy is 2443 joules. The kinetic energy is 0 joules. At the bottom of the drop, the potential energy is 0 and the kinetic is 2443 joules. Going down the hill is turning the potential energy into kinetic energy. To find the total energy you have to add the potential energy and the kinetic energy. Unless another force is acting on the car, the total energy will stay the same. The initial drop height needs to be greater than the hill height. For example, when the initial drop height is 5 meters and the hill height is 2 meters the car will succeed in getting to the end. When the initial drop height is 5 meters and the hill height is 5 meters, the car won't succeed in getting to the end.
