To have a fun roller coaster ride you need to have speed and variation. Your initial drop is important in deciding how much total energy you will have for the ride, the greater the height of the initial drop, the greater the potential energy. Total energy is the potential energy and the kinetic energy added together. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be converted into another type of energy. So, as you go down the drop, your potential energy is being converted into kinetic energy. 

If the hill height is the same or greater than the height of the initial drop, then the car will not make it over the hill with the kinetic energy it got from the potential energy going down the initial drop. If the hill height is higher than the initial drop then the car will not travel over the hill because it won't have enough energy. The mass of the car affects the amount of potential energy, thus affecting the amount of kinetic energy. The more mass that the car has, the more potential energy it will have at the top and the amount of kinetic energy it will have at the bottom.
