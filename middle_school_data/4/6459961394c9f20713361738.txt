What recommendations would you make to the Gonzales family about your best roller coaster design so far? 

You need to design a roller coaster knowing what potential and kinetic energy is. So it works.
This roller coaster design is going to have a big drop right away. Then it will go to the hill. The first drop has to be higher than the upcoming hill because the Potential energy goes away and comes the kinetic energy, if you don't have enough kinetic energy to make it up the hill. At the bottom of the hill for it to go up and make it you have to have more kinetic energy at the bottom then potential energy at the top.

The mass of the car/cart matters too. If its too heavy then the drop needs to be a lot higher than the up coming hill or 360. I dont have any examples but or no exactly how heavy a cart can be but I do know that The cart has to be a weight that it can go up hills.
