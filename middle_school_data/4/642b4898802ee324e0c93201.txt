Hey, Mr. Gonzales I've created a roller coaster design for you. I can explain to you why I created it like this and my thought process of why I did it like this. The initial drop height will have to be higher than the hill. It can make it to where the car will finish the ride, if you don't the ride won't make it to the end and won't have any excitement or shock to it. One example i can give you is if you had a 5 meter initial drop and the hill is 10 meters high the car will not make it to the top of the hill. The higher the initial drop it will create more potential energy than if the drop was low. PE and KE can only be transformed into each other they can never be created or destroyed. This means that while the car is sitting at the initial drop it will have PE and when it makes it to the bottom of the drop it will have transformed into KE. This basically breaks down to PE = no movement, KE = movement. The total energy can always be known if you know what the PE is because they are the same thing. During the ride the energy will not be destroyed nor created it will only be converted into thermal and sound. The more mass the car carries the more energy it will have and it will conserve it.
