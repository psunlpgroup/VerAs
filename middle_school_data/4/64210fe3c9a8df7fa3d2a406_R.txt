The drop of my roller coaster is 5m. This relates to PE and KE. For example When the hight was 5m the carts PE at the top was 1952 and KE was 0.The more hight the more PE. When the cart was at the bottom of the hill the PE was 0 and the KE was 1952. Energy cant be created or destroyed so knowing that the total energy has to be 1952 and the KE+PE has to be 1952 in a frictionless world. When the cart goes down the hill the PE goes down and the KE goes up. No energy is gained or lost. Drop hight and hill hight arre simaler because the hill needs the drop. An example is if the KE is the same as the hills PE the cart will not make it up. If they hills PE is smaller that the hills KE the cart will make it up the hill. Mass efects the PE because the more mass there is the more PE there is. IN my data the mass was 40kg and the PE at the top of the drop was 1952, but when the mass was 60kg the PE was 2929. This also aplies to KE.
