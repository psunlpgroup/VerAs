If the roller coaster car has a mass of 50 and the initial drop height is 5 meters at the top of the hill your car will have potential energy because it has a place to go and it may eventually fall. If your car had a mass of 60 it would have a greater amount of potential energy at the top because the more mass something has the more potential energy it would have.

   Also it applies to kinetic energy because if your car weighs more and has the same height of the initial drop the more kinetic energy it will have. It will be moving faster and have more friction than a car that would be lighter. When you are going down the drop your potential energy will drop to zero and your KE will start to increase. 
   If you are going to drop down a smaller hill it is going to be the same thing as before but you will have less potential energy because the hill is smaller. When you are going down the initial drop the next hill has to be smaller than the drop because if it is not you will not be able to make it over and may get stuck. The reason that is, is because if the drop and the hill were the same height or taller the initial drop. It only gives you a certain amount of energy and if you only get enough for that drop and the hill is taller there would not  enough energy to make it over. Some of the KE is turned into heat energy because of the friction, The friction sometimes is so much and going so fast that the energy turns into heat energy or it can be conserved.   
  When you are going down the hill your PE drops and you gain more KE because of the friction. The total energy is based on how much PE and KE you have throughout the coaster, The more mass you have the higher you PE, KE, and total energy there is. Also having a higher hill drop, but not higher than the initial drop  will increase the energy.
