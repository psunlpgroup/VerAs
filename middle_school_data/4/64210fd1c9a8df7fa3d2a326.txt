My team and I have come up with a couple ideas for the roller coaster for you and your family's park. We want to start with an initial drop height of 5 m. That would create a PE of 2,443 J and a KE of 0 J at the initial drop, and a total energy of 2,443 J. Then the PE at the bottom of the initial drop will be around 1 J and the KE at the bottom of the initial drop will be 2,442 J, with a total energy of 2,443 J. We also did another test where the initial drop was 4 m, giving the PE at the top of the initial drop 1955 J, and a KE of 0 J at the top.  Then at the bottom of the initial drop, it would give a PE of 1 and a KE of 1954. This shows that if the height is higher then the total energy, the KE, and the PE, will be more. The total energy does not change throughout the ride even while the KE and the PE are changing. We decided to do 5 m since that is the highest height we could do.
We will then add a hill, with the height of around 4 m.  We would have done 5 m, but in my data when testing a hill height of 5 m and a initial drop height of 5 m, we found that the coaster couldn't make it over the hill. We found that this happens since there isn't enough KE to make it over the hill since the energy has to be split in between KE and PE, we had to make it 4 m. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that Energy can't be created or destroyed only changed, and that is also the reason we can't make the hill height and the initial drop the same. Keep in mind that the tests we are doing are in a frictionless environment, so this data wouldn't be the same as if it was in the real world.  
We were also planning on making the carts 60 kg, since that would give the ride more energy at the at the initial drop and at the bottom of the drop. In a test I did where the mass of the car was 60 kg, the total energy was 2936 J. Then in a different test where the mass was 50 kg and the mass was 2446 J. This shows that when the mass increases the energy increases.
