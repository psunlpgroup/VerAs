The drop height of the roller coaster would be five meters and the hill would be three meters because, when the drop height is higher, the kinetic energy will be greater at the bottom. For example, when I had the hill height at 5 and the initial drop at 4.5, the roller coaster couldn't make it to the end of the ride. I would also have the car weigh a heavier mass because, in my trials, the more mass the car had, the more total energy it has. The higher the initial drop of the roller coaster, the more total energy the roller coaster will have. Having the most potential energy is essential because potential energy will transfer to kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill. This is due to the "Law of Conservation of Mass". This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transformed into another form.
