i would make the top of the start taller  then the hill because theirs more energy going up the hill .and less gravity pulling it down and with more energy the more speed and better movement .kinetic energy should be the same as the end as the begin of the potential energy . the potential energy begins at the start because it hasn't been used yet kinetic is at the end  . because its been used mass can effect both energy because it can effect how high or fast the cart can go. initial drop height and hill height effect each other because initial  drop height can make the cart go higher on the hill
