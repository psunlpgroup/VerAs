I would recommend starting the rollercoaster with a tall initial drop. This provides more potential energy that will continue throughout the ride. The hill always has to be smaller than the intitial drop so that the car can make it up the hill. An example of this would be the intitial drop set at 4. This would cause the potential energy to be very high at the beginning, so that the kinetic energy lasts through a 3.75 hill. I would recommend that the mass be 50 kg because then it isn't too fast or too slow. The total energy would end up being 1,952 joules.
