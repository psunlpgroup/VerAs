The drop height of my roller coaster design is 250 meters. This is because the higher your drop is, the more energy it has, therefor, it will be able to make it to the end with ease. When the initial drop was 2.5 meters, the potential energy was 1334 joules at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1334. Then, when the drop was 5 meters, the potential energy was 2668 at the top and the kinetic energy was 2666 at the bottom. It is essential to have the initial drop to be higher than any other hills, loops, etc. because the law of conservation of energy states that no energy can be created or destroyed, so, there wouldn't be enough energy to make it to the end if there was a hill higher than the initial drop. As you can see from the data above, when the height is the same the potential energy at the top, and the kinetic energy at the bottom are equal. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. So, when you are about half way down the hill, potential and kinetic energy are about equal, and then when you get to the bottom, all of the energy would have converted from potential to kinetic energy. Although, in the real world (simulation excludes this part for accurate data), some of the energy will change into other forms like heat, sound, etc. so the potential energy at the top, and the kinetic energy at the bottom wouldn't be equal. In addition, when the mass increases, potential, kinetic, and total energy will all increase. Total energy is the combination of potential, and kinetic energy combined at any time. This is possible because (in a friction less environment) potential energy could go up, and kinetic energy could go down, but the total energy will always stay the same.
