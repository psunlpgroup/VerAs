Dear Gonzalez family 
Here are my findings from our research on rollercoasters. First, we did the initial drop we learned that potential energy turned into kinetic energy as stated in trials 1,2,3, and 4 in trial 1 there was 2443 pe and 0 ke but at the bottom, there were 2443 ke and 0 pe. Then we studied hills and we learned if the hill is the same height or bigger than the initial drop the cart doesn't have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill we also learned that the bigger the hill the more pe as shown with test trials with 5m and 4m hills 5 had 2443 Jules and 4 had 1961 Jules. Then we did mass and energy we learned that the heavier carts had more energy than the lighter carts as shown in mass vs energy. so to have a big ride that is fun you have to have a lot of potential energy at the top of the initial hill and a lot of kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial hill so I think that 5m would be the best hill for that potential energy to be turned into kinetic energy. So you can have a long fun and thrilling ride.
