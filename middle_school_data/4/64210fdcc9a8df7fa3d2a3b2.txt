The drop height of my roller coaster will start off being 5m high. 5 meters high will then have more energy, which will make the roller coaster go faster. For example, when the height was 4m high, the PE was 1955J. When I increased the height to 5m, the PE was 2553J. This happens because the higher up the roller coaster is, the more PE it will have because PE is how high something is. After the roller coaster reached the bottom of the drop, there was no PE because there was no height, and it all translated into KE. It translated into KE because there is KE when there is motion. So while the roller coaster is moving, the PE would be converting into KE, because there is more motion while the height is going down. Due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, mass cannot be created nor destroyed, making the total energy stay the same throughout the whole ride.
 
Moving on, I feel the drop height should be 4m. I decided on this because we still want the ride to be fun, so having a bigger hill would be more enjoyable. But if we make the hill too high, then the roller coaster wouldn't be able to make it over the hill. For example, when I did 4m, it made it over the hill fine, but when I did 5m, it didn't make it over. This is because it didn't have enough KE. 

Lastly, I would like to make the mass of the car 60kg. I decided on this because the more mass the car has, the more energy will be given. For example, when the car mass was 50kg, the PE was 1958J. But when I increased the mass to 60kg, the PE was 2349J. By doing this, the car will have more energy making it able to go faster in the long run. Yes, it will accelerate slower, but it would be faster. To end this, I hope you take my proposal for my first design for the roller coaster.
