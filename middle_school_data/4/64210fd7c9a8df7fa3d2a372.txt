The drop height of my roller coaster design is 250 meters. This is because the higher your drop is, the more energy it has, therefor, it will be able to make it to the end with ease. When the initial drop was 2.5 meters, the potential energy was 1334 joules at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1334. Then, when the drop was 5 meters, the potential energy was 2668 at the top and the kinetic energy was 2666 at the bottom. Having the initial drop be higher than any of the hills or loops is best because then the roller coaster will have enough energy to make it to the end. As you can see from the data above, when the height is the same the potential energy at the top, and the kinetic energy at the bottom are equal. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed. So, when you are about half way down the hill, potential and kinetic energy are about equal, and then when you get to the bottom, all of the energy would have converted from potential to kinetic energy. Although, in the real world (simulation excludes this part for accurate data), some of the energy will change into other forms like heat, sound, etc. so the potential energy at the top, and the kinetic energy at the bottom wouldn't be equal. In addition, when the mass increases, potential, kinetic, and total energy will all increase.
