The higher the hill the more inital PE there will be and the more KE at the end. For example for a 5 m hill it is 2442J and for a 2.55 it is 1246J. PE and KE are types of energy that a roller coaster needs to work. The energy starts at PE and then it changes to KE. Energy tranformation is when energy changes/transfers to a different energy, Law of conservation of energy is when energy has a consistant change. You have to have higher initial drop height than hill height. For example if you have a inital drop height of 5m you can't have a hill height of 5 m because than it won't make it over the hill. The PE and KE energy should be equal to the total energy.
