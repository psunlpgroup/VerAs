The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the height was the largest it could be and the energy gave it enough momentum to go all the way down the hill. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1624 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE 
increased at 2166 Joules. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So when the energy at the top for PE is high and the PE at the bottom is low I know that the PE turned into both thermal energy and KE. The same thing happens to KE. At the top the KE is low and at the bottom the KE is high because the PE has turned into KE. Mass also effects PE and KE. The more mass something has the slower it will go down the hill. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is that both PE and KE add up to create total energy. The height of the drop also effects PE and KE. At the top, the PE has the largest number but at the bottom it has a smaller number. Also at the top, the KE has a smaller number but at the bottom it has a larger number.
