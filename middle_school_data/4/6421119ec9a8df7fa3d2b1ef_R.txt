Based of the data I have collected, we would want a roller coaster that has a high amount of mass. The more mass the car has, the more potential energy the car has, meaning it goes further. We noticed that a 40 kg car with only 1955 J of energy with a 5m drop and 2m hill. However, a 60kg car had 2932 J of energy with the same hill and drop. We also found that the amount of potential energy at the top of the drop transferred into kinetic energy. And as the car goes down the hill, the potential energy transfers into kinetic energy. Because of Law of Conservation of Energy, the car can only go up a hill that is less than the height of the initial drop. We also noticed that unless there is friction, the total energy will stay the same. The potential energy will only transfer into kinetic energy, and this will go back and forth. But if there is friction, the total energy will decrease, because some of the energy will be lost into heat and sound energy.
