The reason why the roller coaster would work is because its initial drop height 3.50 is higher then the hill height 3.25.The reason that is because if the hill height is higher there will not be enough kinetic energy to make it up the hill.For example when i did the roller coaster simulation i had a trial where i set the initial drop height to 3.50 and the hill height to 4.0 the cart could not make over the hill but when i kept the drop height the same and lowered the hill height to 3.25 it got over the hill . the reason that the hill height must be higher is because as it came down the hill potential energy transfers to   kinetic energy allowing it up the hill. And another thing that helps is  more mass  when something has more mass the more kinetic energy it has is higher  at the bottom and it would make it go faster up the hill. For example in my trial the drop height for both simulations was 3.50 and the hill height was 3.25 and when the 60 kg  cart had 2054 jolts of potential energy while the 40 kg had 978 witch proves the heavier the cart the more energy making it easier to get to the top of the hill. In conclusion the design i will be fun and work because the the drop height is higher then the hill height
