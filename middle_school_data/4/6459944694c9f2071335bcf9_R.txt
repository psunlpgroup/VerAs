Dear, the Gonzales Family 
I have been doing a lot of research on roller coasters. I believe that my idea would be a great addition to your park, attract a lot more people to come to your park. 
       The first thing is height everyone is looking for a tall, fast, stomach-dropping ride. I came up with is the ride will have a 4.05(m) release height. At the top of the release drop the PE will be at 1585(J) and the KE will be at 0(J). At the bottom of the release drop now the PE is at 1(J) and the KE is at 1584(J). 
       The total energy changes from PE to KE, Many times throughout the ride. This makes it speed it and slow down. That affects the ride a lot because if it didn't change in speed that could be really bad and mess everything up. 
   The car changes from PE to KE so it can slow down when going downhill and then gets more PE the get speed to go back up.  Energy transformation is when the cart goes from PE to KE and then back to PE.  The law of conservation of energy is when the cart stays at the same speed for a period of time.  
    The drop height needs to be higher than the hill. Or anything else  you add or it wont go over because it doesnt have energy.
