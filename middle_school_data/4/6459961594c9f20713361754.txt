We started with a drop that is 5m tall and 2.40m long. for max PE and KE then a medium sized hill in the middle going into a loop you can adjust those two as long either of them go as high or higher than the beginning drop. the reason we have the height, length, and car weight is so you can have a very high amount of PE at the top of the drop. then by the time you get to the bottom of the drop, all of the PE gets turned into KE for more speed. In this essay you will learn about the roller coaster design my team and I developed.
