To begin, I recommend having an initial drop height of 5 m. This is because the higher the drop height, the more energy the coaster has to continue along. For example, when the release height is only 2.5 m the potential energy is only 1466 Joules. Whereas, when the initial drop height is increased to five the potential energy is 2932 Joules. The more energy the better, because it will increase the excitement. Also, it will leave wiggle room for energy transfer. The Law of Conservation of Energy states energy can change forms, but it can't be created or destroyed.

Next, when building the coaster's hill make sure it is lower than the initial drop. If you have an initial drop of five, the coaster car won't be able to reach over the hill. I would recommend having a hill height of around 3.75 m. You will have energy transferred back to potential energy when on top of the hill. Make sure you have a high potential energy at the top of the hill for the rest of the ride, but have enough kinetic energy to get over the hill. For example, with a hill height of 3.75 m you will have 2123 Joules of potential energy at the top of the hill, and 814 Joules of kinetic energy at that same point. Therefore with this, you can still get over the hill but have enough potential energy to keep the rest of the ride fun.

Lastly, I recommend you make the car mass 60 kg. At the start of the coaster, the total energy will be 2937 Joules. But if you make the mass only 40 kg, the total energy will only be 1958 Joules. The heavier the car mass, the more energy the car has at the top of the drop and at the bottom of the hill. The more energy you have, the faster your car can go. This is because potential energy and kinetic energy always add up to total energy, but total energy doesn't change when there's no friction. Therefore, making your mass larger will increase your energy, speed and excitement.
