I think that we should use the top height to give it the most pe and ke possible this will increase to total energy.by having a higher hill it will give more pe and that will also increase the speed of it by increasing the ke.I think this becouce the faster it goes the more fun it is.For the hill i think that we should have it to where its at 4 becuase when ive done a rollercoaster its more fun when you go up and almost stop then go back down.For the mass i think that we should put it at 45 becuase its not to light but it also is not to heavy so this will still give it a good amount of pe and keit will also keep it from getting more fristion..Adding onto the inisial drop i think that also by putting it higher will make it so then it can go up a higher hill.
