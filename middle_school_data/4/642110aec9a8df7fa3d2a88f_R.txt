What I would say to the Gonzales family would be: how I got my best roller coaster design was first of all my height of the initial drop is higher or taller then any hills that come after it. That relates to PE at the top and KE at the bottom for PE it relates by how on top of the hill. The initial drop is higher and KE relates by how when it is on the bottom for KE the initial drop is higher amount. The relation between PE, and KE and total energy is most of the time the PE is usually a big number. But the KE is usually zero so then the total energy is basically just the PE and that affects the ride. Because when on top of the hill the PE is high number and KE is zero but when the KE which is on the bottom of hill when the ride goes there the PE is zero and the KE is high number. Next is changes in PE and KE when car moves down the hill when on top of the hill the PE takes over the numbers and when on the bottom of the hill the KE takes over the numbers. Next is the energy transformation and the law of conservation energy. The energy transformation is how the energy transforms in the ride and the conservation of energy is the conservation of energy basically. And how in the ride the energy affects how the rides move up and down. The relationship between initial drop height and hill height is: hill height is the top of the hill and how PE is having a high number and initial drop height is connected to how the big number is. And the total energy and how the hill drops and the height changes. The relationship between mass, PE and KE is: if the mass is bigger then the ride will go a little bit slower. And will be more safe if possible but if ride has a smaller car then the ride will go faster and sometimes less safe in speed wise. And PE has to do with the fact that the ride is on top of the hill less safe. And KE is if the ride is less safe on the bottom. That is what I would say.
