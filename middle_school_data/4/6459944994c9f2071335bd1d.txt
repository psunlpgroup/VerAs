Dear, Gonzales family

The roller coaster design I have come up with will be a great addition to the park as my roller coaster is long, scary, exciting, has tons of inversions, a huge hill, a corkscrew, and rings of fire. The coaster will be made from titanium and the cart will be made from wood and weigh around 60kg. We will drop from a world record height of 500 feet through a loop with a hole in it. Then we will get pulled up 600 feet by magnets to a drop down into a loop that leads into a corkscrew and into under ground where you go upside down twice before coming to a stop. While the cart shouldn't be able to make it up the 600 ft hill since there isn't enough kinetic energy we will have magnets shoot and then pull you up. At the top of the hill there will be tons of potential energy since its very high up and the cart is very heavy. But when we get to the bottom of the drop there should be very little potential energy and tons of kinetic energy since the potential energy transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy should help us get through the loop. we will get over the jump in the loop using magnets to keep the cart at a precise spot so there are no fatality's. Once through the loop the magnets will help us get to the top of the hill then when we are at the top there is a spot for people to get of if they don't wish to continue. Once all passenger who don't want to continue are off the cart now full of potential energy, drops having its potential energy transform into kinetic. Once at the bottom it will go through a loop into a cork screw and go under ground through to inversions to where magnets bring it to a stop. This is why the roller coaster i have come up with will be a great addition to the park.
