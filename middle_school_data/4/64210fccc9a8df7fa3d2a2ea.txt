The car would start at a drop height of 5 meters, the higher the drop height the more total energy (TE) the cart would have. For example when I had a drop height of 2 there was 1173J but with a drop height of 5 there was 2932J of energy. It would have only potential energy (PE) at the top of the initial drop and at the bottom it would have mostly Kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom. In a friction less environment, TE will never change while PE and KE will, but will always add up to TE. As the cart goes down the drop the PE will change into KE and halfway down it will be 50/50. PE will change into KE and the opposite, but they will never be less energy as, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy can't be created or destroyed. The drop height cannot be smaller than the hill height, otherwise the cart will not make it to the end of the coaster. For the connection to mass and energy, in short, more mass equals more energy. My idea for the coaster is to have an initial drop height of 5 meters and a hill height of 3 meters. The car mass will be 55 kg making it have a lot of energy to make it to the end of the ride.
