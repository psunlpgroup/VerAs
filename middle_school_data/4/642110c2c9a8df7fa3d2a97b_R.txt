Hello Gonzales family, you roller coaster will be fun and exciting because our design is perfect!! 

First off, our initial drop is the highest possible so it will give you the best chance to make it to the end without stopping on the hill. This is because the height of our initial drop will give the car the highest amount of PE possible, and it will give the car the most amount of KE possible. When the car is going down the initial drop, the PE will slowly decrease due to the decline in elevation, but the KE will slowly increase because of the velocity of the car accelerating. So this pretty much means that PE and KE are slowly swapping because of the elevation and velocity changes instead of the energy completely disappearing. According to the Law of Conservation of Energy energy can't be created nor destroyed which means that the KE and PE will always have to add up to the total amount of energy according to this law. Also we will insure that the car is going to make it to the end because we will have a comfortable proportion. This proportion is the hill height is half as tall as the initial drop height, this will allow the car to reach the end at a safe and steady pace. The mass of the car also effects how far and fast the car makes it. The more mass the car has, the more PE and KE the car will have, this is a direct relationship. This is a direct relationship because gravity pulls harder to stuff that has a greater weight/mass which gives the car more PE and KE.
