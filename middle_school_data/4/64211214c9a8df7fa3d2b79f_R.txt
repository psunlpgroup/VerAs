The recommendations I would make for the Gonzales' family roller coaster is making sure the initial drop is larger than the hill. Me and my team have discovered if the initial drop is not taller than the hill, the cart will not have enough potential energy to make it over the entire roller coaster. At the top of the initial drop, the cart will have more potential energy the higher the drop. The more potential energy it has at the top, the more kinetic energy it will obtain going down the hill. That is why my team recommends having a very tall drop so it will be a fast enjoyable ride that can maintain the energy it needs to get over the hills. We have also discovered that the total energy will not change. With the laws conservation of energy, no energy should be created or destroyed. This law was shown throughout the roller coaster.When the potential energy goes down, the kinetic energy goes up and vise versa. For example, on our roller coaster at the top of the drop the car has a lot of potential energy and no kinetic energy, but as the car goes down the hill the energy transfers into kinetic energy. This is not meaning that any energy is created nor destroyed, it is simply meaning that energy is transformed into another type of energy. We have also found out the more mass of the car, the more energy there will be. It simple terms, the Gonzales family should have a car with a large mass and a tall initial drop to have a fun and safe ride.
