As we start our roller coaster to the height of 5 meters. The potential energy is always going to be more than the Kinetic energy at the top of the initial drop. when I measured the PE at the top of the initial the the PE was 1221 and the kinetic energy at the top of the drop was 3. The total energy of the drop between PE and Kinetic Energy was 1222. jewels  When the car was going down the drop PE went down in energy and Kinetic Energy went up in energy. When the PE went down the energy converted  into the kinetic energy. The drop height has more energy than the hill height because it has to be smaller than the initial drop to get to the rest of the roller coaster. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed but is converted into another type of energy.this tells us when the roller car goes down the coaster the potential energy is converted into the kinetic energy.  The mass of the car was 50 grams. We know that the greater the mass the greater the energy. if the mass is in the middle range that means the energy is medium speed.
