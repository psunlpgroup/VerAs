The drop height of my roller coaster design is five meters. This is because the height mixed with energy changes PE is 2,445, and KE is 0J But as the cart goes down the KE goes from 0J all the way to 2,445. PE on the other hand swaps to 0J while TE stays at 2,445. It also involves heat energy with sound energy
So therefore different increases in height will change and decrease. Even though they will change it's only cause of height, mass is gonna change all the results because it will change.


There are many different ways to change the TE but to change the TE you need to change PE so therefore it has requirements.  There are different ways to find the answers including finding PE, KE, and more
