Rollercoaster Essay #1 
Dear, Gonzales family
I think the best Initial drop height should be 5 meters tall. My reason why, is it will have more total energy so it will have a greater percent chance to make it to the end of the ride because it will have more energy to make it to the end. My evidence is in trial #1, the drop height was 2 meters and the total energy was only 969J, and in trial #5 the drop height was 5 meters and the total energy increased to 2443J. During the drops, the PE kept getting lower, and as it got farther down the drop that energy changed into KE and KE kept growing until there was no more PE to convert into KE. That's why I think the Initial drop of the roller coaster should be 5 meters tall. I think the best Hill height should be 3.5 meters tall. My reason why, is it will have enough energy to make it over the hill to make it to the end of the ride. My evidence is in trial #1, the hill height was 2 meters tall and the KE at the top was 730J and it made it over the hill and to the end of the track. In my second trial, the hill height was 2.5 meters tall and KE at the top decreased to 485J and barely made it over the hill. That's why I think the best hill height is 3.5 meters tall. I think the best car mass should be 55kg. My reason why, is it will have a safe amount of energy and it will not have a ton of extra energy to make it unsafe for people. My evidence is in trial #1 when the mass of the car was 40kg the TE was only 1955J. In my fourth trial, the mass of the car was 55kg and TE was increased to 2679J. This proves that when you add more mass to an object the energy increases with it. That's why I think the mass of the car should be 55kg.
