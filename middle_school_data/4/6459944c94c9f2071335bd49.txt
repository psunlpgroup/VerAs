Here are some recommendations I would give you for your roller coaster. The higher you make the start the higher the energy is going to be the more fast and fun the rider will have. At 5 meters release height, the total energy is 2932, the energy is higher than 4 meters release height which is 2346 total energy. The drop height needs to be higher than the hills so that the car can get over. Ke + Pe = Te. Energy cannot be created in a closed system, so you must ensure you have enough energy to get over the hills. One to get more energy is to make the hill higher. Another way to get more energy is to make the car have a higher mass. A car with 60kg has 2937J of energy while a car with 42kg only has 2054J. The car at the top of the hill stopped has all of its energy as potential energy waiting to be spent. Once it has reached the bottom of the hill all of the Pe turns into Ke. Throughout the ride, the total energy remains the same. My design follows the requirements for energy with the drop being higher than both of the loops the cart can successfully make it to the end. My design is fast and fun with a high drop height and a heavy cart. Please choose my design.
