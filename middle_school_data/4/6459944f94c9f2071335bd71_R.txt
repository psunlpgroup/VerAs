I would recommend that the Gonzales family try our coaster because it is fun and exhilarating. The reason our coaster will be awesome is the initial drop is pretty high at the height of 3.75 meters. This is good because the higher the initial drop is the more potential energy there is, and if there is more potential energy then that means there is also more kinetic energy. I know this because as the car goes down the hill potential energy changes to kinetic. This also creates a lot of speed and g force making the ride fun and exciting. You then go up a hill with a height of 2 meters. You will have more then enough kinetic energy to make it to the top of this hill. I know this is true because in my trials. I found that if the initial drop is higher then the hill you will have enough energy to get over the hill. This is shown in trial 1 of adding hills where the initial drop is 3.75 meters and the hill is 2 meters. In this trial the coaster makes it to the end of the track. Where as in trial 3 the initial drop is 3.75 meters and the hill is 4 meters tall causing the coaster to be unable get over the hill. This shows that my teams coaster would make it to the end because the hill is shorter then the initial drop. I know we won't lose any energy because of the law of conservation of energy. The law of conservation of energy is that energy can't be created or destroyed but can change forms. So I know the energy will be the same every time allowing the coaster to make it to the end every single time.
