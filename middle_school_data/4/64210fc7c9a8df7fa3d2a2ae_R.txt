 The drop height when changed changes the PE for example when i had a release height of 5 meters beside 4 meters the 5 meter one had a higher PE because the higher you go up the better PE it has. 
The same is with KE At the top it is at zero and at the bottom it has the same amount as the PE had at the top. That when adding up for total energy you add both KE and PE together.  When the cart is going down the PE changes to KE on the way down when it is at half way the have the same amount. When the energy is being transfer. and the law of conservation of mass states that  energy can not  be crated or destroy. but it can be transfused in to KE or PE. The relationship between drop height and hill height because the hill height is when it is at the very top and the drop height is when it is going down.  That the lighter the mass is it will have a better PE because it weighs less. I tested this zero friction that is not real and cant happen. that when there is more mass there is more energy because it is more heavy. also when i test the drop height was at 5 meters it had 2668 PE. and at the bottom it had 0 PE the Ke had 0 at the top and at the bottom it had 2668 Ke this shows that the PE gave Ke all the energy.
