Dear Gonalzes family,
If I were to design a roller coaster would make the start an elevator where the roller coaster moves up 35 feet to a gassed-powered start. Where the ride would start with around 2600J total energy which we have thankfully lowered to ensure more safety to others. The ride would move through twists and turns giving the ride around 2250J potential energy. the ride then meets a 25-foot hill using all the potential energy and making it convert into kinetic energy to around 2100J. then the ride would go through a 360-turn bringing back all the potential energy to then go into a 35ft hill. The ride would not be able to go up because of the number of tests we have done before this ride and have total energy needed to make the hill. Then the ride would move backward through the track bringing back all the total energy that was used to try to make it up the hill. Then the ride would move all through the track to where it would go down a hill back to the elevator. Before making the ride we made many tests and we lowered the total energy from 3000J to 2400J to make the ride safe for others. Compared to the other rides we have made in the past, like having a drop around 40 feet which we have lowered to around 35 feet to still keep it fun but not as dangerous as before.
