Dear Gonzalaz Family,

 	I and my engineering team have come up with a design that will increase ratings and satisfaction and is safe the height of the initial drop should be 3.50M the hill height should be  3.00M and the car mass should be 45kg.
 	my team figured out that if the height of the ID is 3.50 it will have enough PE that the KE that will be enough to get over the hill and through the loop. In my teams trial #1 the height was 2.00M and the PE was 977J so we went up 1.00M in trial #2 and it was 1466J
So we went up .50M in trial #3 and it was 1710J and it was just enough PE to get through the entire ride.
	If my team went lower than 3.50M then the car would not make it through the ride the PE and KE are the reason the car moves through the ride and if the height is lower so are TE and PE which would ruin the ride. When the car moves down the hill the PE will convert into KE and the kinetic energy will be enough to make it through the hill.
If we can make the loop and hill a little bit shorter than the initial drop that the friction shouldn't be too much of a problem and will keep the riders safe with this design it would be a not too short and not too long of a ride and won't be dangerous for the riders at your park.
