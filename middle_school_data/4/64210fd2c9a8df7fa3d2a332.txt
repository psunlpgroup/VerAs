The drop height is five meters. My group decided on this specific height because we think going the highest even though it could be risky, we figured out with a specific amount of mass,add a lop instead of the hill first. It will work because the penitential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE) would not be an issue. Lets break it down. At the start, PE was 2443, and going through the roller coaster, the end it was at the end it was 1. Going down that drastically, shows how the mass is light, and how it would make the roller coaster fast. Meanwhile with are second choice being four, it starts at 1955 and ends at 1835, making it slow, and boring.   The five works better to for the lop, because when the lop goes down we can make the hill pretty high because of the power of it going down. We decided on 3.5 for the hill because its a little more then half way, and the mass going down so much will make the energy go down. That will eventually after the coaster hits the hill. it will slow down because we also have a straight line at the end eventually making it stop. I hoped this helped your understanding of roller coasters!
