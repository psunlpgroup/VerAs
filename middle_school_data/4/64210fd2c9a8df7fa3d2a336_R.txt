Dear. Gonzales Family, the drop is going to be 5m because the total energy is substantial to the height of the hill.  When the car mass is 50 the PE top of the initial drop (5m) would be 1958 J and KE bottom of Drop would be 1955 J. The total energy would be 1958 which would be good because the car would not need friction to get over the kill which would make it very fun for customers. No energy is created or destroyed so what happens to the mass at the bottom? It transfers to thermal energy. The height and PE are related because the higher the height the greater the PE will be at the top of the hill. The height and hill height of the track is related because the drop is a measure of energy and the hill is a measure of PE. KE and PE are the amount of energy in the sim, which means the mass depends on KE and PE. Ke and PE are related because PE at the top of the hill turns into KE at the bottom and the leftover energy goes to thermal because you can't destroy energy or create it. This is our idea Gonzales family.
