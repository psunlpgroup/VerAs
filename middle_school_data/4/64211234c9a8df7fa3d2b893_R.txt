Dear Gonzales family,
I recommend making the cart a higher mass to create more PE and KE. I found that 3.5 to 4 Meters was a safe drop point because the PE and KE weren't extremely high. I also found that I couldn't get my car over a hill higher than 1720 PE and 239 KE at the top of a hill. The Energy transformation was higher when no hill or a smaller hill existed. At the top of the drop, the cart's PE was as high as possible and the KE was as low as possible, as the cart moved down the hill the cart gains no PE but transfers the PE into KE. Once the cart reached the bottom of the drop the PE was fully transferred to KE so the cart's KE was now as high as possible and the cart's PE was now as low as possible. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy was that total energy was the only energy that was the same as the PE at the top of the drop and the KE at the bottom of the drop this is because total energy is the most amount of energy that can be produced. The relationship between the drop height and the hill height was that the hill must be at least a little shorter than the drop height.
