                                            Roller Coaster Essay #1


Dear Gonzales family,
	I have been planning your roller coaster with both safety and fun in mind and think the initial drop height should be 4.75m, the hill height should be 4.30m, the loop height should be 4.25m, the car mass should be 58kg, and the friction should be 0.01. With all of this for the rollercoaster the maximum speed will be 9.5 m/s and the maximum acceleration will be 41.2 m/s2. With these numbers being the maximum speed and acceleration the roller coaster is fun to ride and safe to ride. The initial drop height of my roller coaster design is 4.75m; with this as my initial drop height my PE at the top of the initial drop is 2692J and the KE at the bottom of the initial drop is 2692J. When I decrease the height of the initial drop to 4.40m the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2494j and at the bottom of the initial drop the KE was 2494j. Then I decided to increase the height of the initial drop to 5m. The PE at the top of the roller coaster was 2834j and at the bottom at the initial drop the KE was 2834j. When I decreased the height of the initial drop the roller coaster speed went down because the mass of the car went down causing there to be a decrease in TE. I know this because to get TE you need KE and PE added and to get PE it is mass multiplied by gravity multiplied by height. So by changing the mass of the car it affects PE which then affects the TE and KE. If you went with the 5m initial drop height it would make the roller coaster unsafe to ride. I have the hill height being 4.30m making the maximum speed 9.5 m/s and the maximum acceleration 41.2 m/s2. With these rates it makes the roller coaster both fun and safe. The height for the hill makes the roller coaster both fun and safe because if we lowered the height of the hill to 3.25m it would cause the maximum speed to be 8.3 m/s and the maximum acceleration would be 31.2 m/s2. This would make the roller coaster lower the speed and acceleration making the roller coaster not as fun. If we increase the hill height to 5m the car would not go over the hill height because it is higher than the initial drop. This would conclude us back to the hill height being 4.30m because if we lower the height it is not as fun and if we make the hill height higher the car will not go over the hill. I believe that the loop height should be 4.25m because it makes the loop both fun and safe. If the loop height is 4.25m the maximum speed and acceleration would be 9.5 m/s and the maximum acceleration would be 41.2 m/s2. If we lower the height of the loop to 3.25m the speed on the loop would be very low and the acceleration would be too. If we increased the height of the loop to 5m the car would not go over the loop and would be unsafe to ride the roller coaster. This would leave it to be that the height of the loop would have to be 4.25m to be fun and safe.
