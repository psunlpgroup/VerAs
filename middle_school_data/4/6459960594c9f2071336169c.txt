Rollercoaster Essay:

Roller Coasters have many different factors that go into preparing and creating them. These factors are Friction, Mass, Height, Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy. At the start of roller coasters they have the most Potential Energy. Once the ride starts the potential energy converts into kinetic energy by the total amount of energy stays the same the whole time. The reason the total is always the same is because of The Law of Conservation of Energy which says that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.

When you add friction to the equation that causes a slow down to the total speed. This means that the energy of the roller coaster will not be the same the entire time and the friction will take some of the energy away. 

Kinetic and potential energy are both the most important factors that go into roller coasters. Potential energy is greater the higher a roller coaster is and the heavier it is, which allows for more kinetic energy ultimately ending in a higher speed. This is shown in the Initial Drop section where each time the roller coasters drop got higher the potential energy increased and thus allowing for the kinetic energy to be increased by the end of the roller coaster.

How does mass affect a roller coaster? The mass affects it because the heavier the roller coaster the more potential energy it will start with and the more kinetic energy the coaster will end with. But if the roller coaster is lighter it will have less potential energy than the heavier one because of how the weight affects the coaster.

Another big factor is height. Height is what gives the roller coaster most of its Potential energy and speed. Its one of the most important factors just behind Energy.

In conclusion you can see the many factors that go into making a roller coaster the best it can be such as Mass, Height, Friction, potential energy and Kinetic energy. Thanks to these factors we are able to have fun on rides such as roller coasters.
