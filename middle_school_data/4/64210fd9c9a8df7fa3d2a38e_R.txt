The drop heigh of my roller coaster design is 4 meters. This is because the higher the drop height the more energy that is being generated, so that would mean it would be able to last the whole ride and have a greater. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 883 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE increased at 1466 Joules. The relationship of PE, KE, and TE is that TE is the combined amount of (PE + KE). This amount may decrease by the end of the ride due to the mechanical energy that absorbs some of the TE. PE and KE change as they go down the drop. The relationship between PE and KE is that when the cart is on the top of the hill, the KE is always 0, but when the cart is at the bottom, the PE is always 0. The energy at the initial drop is always higher than at the bottom. For example, when releasing the cart from 4 meters, at the top of the initial drop  was 883 PE and 0 KE, but it changed. I know this because at the bottom of the initial drop the PE was 0 and KE was 650.  This allows me to talk about energy transformation and Law of Conversation of Energy. Odviously, the total energy decreased because some of it converted to mechanical energy and became useless energy. Thats why the total energy is smaller at the bottom of rides rather than at top. The relationship between drop height and hill height has to make sure hill height is never greater than initial drop height. I know this because when I had a drop height of 4 and hill height of 3.5, the cart made it through the whole ride. But when I had a drop height of 4 and hill height of 5, the cart didn't make it through the ride. Lastly, the relationship between mass, PE and KE! If the cart has a greater mass, the greater the PE and KE will be. I know this because when I had a car mass of 50, the total energy was 2447, but when I had a car mass of 60, the TE was 2936.
