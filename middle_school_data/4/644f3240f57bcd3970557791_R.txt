Rollercoaster Essay 1# 
Dear Gonzales family I have a proposal for the rollercoaster that will be a safe and fun ride for everyone who comes. 

For the initial drop height. I think the Initial drop height should be 4 meters. For example. when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 2112J. When I increased the drop height to 4.25 meters, The PE increased to 2244J.

 Now for the hill height. I think the hill height should be 3 meters. Because when I had the hill height at 4 meters it didn't go over because when the friction was at 0.2 it wasnâ€™t going over. So you can't have the hill at 4 meters but you can have it at 3 meters because the car will go over the hill.

 With the friction  0.2. Next for the car's mass. I think it should be 54kg because if you increase the car mass with 0.2 friction to get the car over the hill. Lastly The height of the loop. I think the loop should be 3.50 meters because if the car mass was bigger it wouldn't be able to go over.

  In the law of conversation, energy cannot be created or destroyed but can be converted to a different energy like PE or KE. And the relationship between  PE and KE is when the car mass increases the PE, KE, and the TE increase. 

So in conclusion these are things that I think would be fun and safe for the Gonzales family roller coaster.
