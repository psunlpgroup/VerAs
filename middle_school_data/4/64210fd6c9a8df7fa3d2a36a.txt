The drop height for my coaster destine is 250 meters. This is because the more height you have you will have a larger PE on the top and a higher KE at the bottom. One example is with a drop height of 2.50 meters the PE at the top was 1334 joules and at the bottom of the drop the KE was at 1333 joules. When compared to a drop height of 5 meters the PE joules  at the top was 2668 and the KE at the bottom was 2666 joules. Having a curtain height of a hill it important, in order to make it up a hill the hill has to be smaller than the initial drop but if it is taller or the same height it will not make it over. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, this states that energy can't be created or destroyed. At the initial drop  of 5 meters the PE is at 2668 joules but at the bottom of the drop the PE is at 0. That is because the energy will be transformed into KE on the way down because at the to of the drop KE joules is at 0 but at the bottom KE is at 2666 joules. The total energy doesn't change tho it will always stay at the same number it is just put into didn't a different energy, for example PE it put into KE or thermal energy.
