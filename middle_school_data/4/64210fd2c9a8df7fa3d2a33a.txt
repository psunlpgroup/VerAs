The drop height for the roller coaster will be 5 meters. This is because the taller the initial drop height the more PE there will be. Having more PE means we will also have more total energy and KE. This is because energy cant be created or destroyed according to the Law of Conservation of Energy. For example  when the initial height was 3 meters the PE at the top was 1466J with the KE being 0J. Then at the bottom the KE was 1456J and PE was 1. Next, we tried 4 meters and got 1955J of PE and 0J of KE at the top, then at the bottom 1954J of KE and 1J PE. Finally we did 5 meters and got a PE of 2443J at the initial drop and KE with 1J PE at the bottom and 2442J of KE. This shows like that I said, the more height there is the more energy there will be, making it so the roller coaster can make it until the end.

For the hill height we decided on 3 meters. This is because the hill height has to be less then the initial drop. It needs to be less then the initial drop because if its to high there wont be enough energy to get over the hill, as energy cant be created. When we tested 5.01 meters the cart was not able to go over. At the top of the hill the PE was 2448J, which is greater than the energy given at five meters, making it so the cart coldnot go over the hill. We decided to go with 3 meters because at the top of the hill the PE was 1471J and KE was 975J with a total of 2446J, making the cart able to go over the hill. 

We also learned that the greater the cars mass the more PE and KE it would have. For example when we used 40kg for weight the PE was 1955J, at the initial drop, and the 1951J of KE at the bottom of the drop. On the other hand a 60kg cart had 2933J of PE at the initial drop, 2927J of KE at the bottom and the total energy being 2933J.
