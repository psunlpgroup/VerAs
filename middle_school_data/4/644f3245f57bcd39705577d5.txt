Dear The Gonzales Family. I and my team are creating your rollercoaster. And we decided to make the initial drop 4m tall.
This is because this height is able to go over hills just less than 4m tall and will have more energy going down the initial drop than heights less than 4m. For example, when we tested the drop height of 3m tall, the joules were only 1466 and couldn't go over as many hills. But when we increased the height to 4m we figured out that it had 1955 joules and could go over higher hills than when it was 3m.

We changed the height of the hill to 3m as the 4m initial drop was able to go over it and make it faster throughout the ride. For example, when we tested this on a simulator when we collected the data we saw that the less hill height there was the more kinetic energy (moved faster). But we also saw that when we added a higher hill when it went over it, it had more kinetic energy coming down. So that's when we decided we will go somewhere right in the middle at 3m tall for a hill height.

Then for the car mass, we decided to at the lightest option to cause less friction because it is very light for a rollercoaster car. But we decided to go with this because we think it will go up the hill faster because it is light, but when we tested this out it doesn't go down the hill as fast but it will still be at least fast because the initial drop and hills will keep it moving.
