I'm going to be talking about what types of energy you need in order to have a fun, and safe roller coaster. As well as why our roller coaster will be best and have these elements. 
Our roller coasters name is the "Top Thrill Dragster!" It would be an honor to have our coaster at your park. Our coaster will have a big drop in the beginning (as for most roller coasters) You will need potential  energy in order to have kinetic energy which is really important for the drop. Potential and kinetic energy can go hand in hand. It isn't created or destroyed. But, it can change from one to the other. Potential prepares for the drop. Having a big hill at the beginning of the coaster is important because you need to have the roller coaster finish and go to the end of the track, and a big drop to start the roller coaster out with is the most efficient way. Along with other hills to support.
In my recent data I found out that cars with less mass go faster on the track, and cars with a lot of mass go slower! For the car mass of 40kg , the total energy was just 1645! But for a car with 60kg the total energy was 2468. 
Our roller coaster track will be fun and safe while having all of these important features. This is why I believe that our track the "Top Thrill Dragster" would be best.
