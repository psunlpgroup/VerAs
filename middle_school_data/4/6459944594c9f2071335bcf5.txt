Dear, The Gonzalez Family 

I think the best roller coaster we could build would be a roller coaster with three hills and two inversions. Both inversions would come after the two of the hills, the hills would be all in different parts of the ride. There would be enough potential energy to get over all hills and inversions. The initial height would be 120-150 feet, the weight of the coaster would be 80-100 kilograms to give the most speed through the ride. 

Sincerely
