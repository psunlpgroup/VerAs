When the height of the drop was increased it increased the PE at the top and KE at the bottom. For example a drop at the height of 2m had 977J of PE at the top and KE at the bottom, and a drop at the height of 5m had 2443J of PE at the top and KE at the bottom. This shows how the height of the drop affects the PE at the top and KE at the bottom as they increase proportionally as the drop height increases. Without friction The PE and KE added up to the total energy. For example at the top of a drop height of 2m had 977J of PE 0J of KE and a TE of 977. As a friction-less coaster went down the drop the PE decreased and the KE proportionally increased. For example at the top of a drop of 2m there was 977J of PE and 0J of KE however at the bottom there was 0J of PE and 977J of KE. This shows the changes in PE and KE and energy transformation from PE to KE. This also shows the law of conservation of energy because the total energy on the friction less drop of 2m stayed the same at 977J which is what the PE and KE added together was. For the coaster to make it over the hill the drop has to be higher. For example the car did not go over a hill of 4m with a 4m drop but did when the hill was 3m. This shows the relationship between drop and hill height. The greater the mass has the greater the PE and KE was. For example when the mass was 40 kg the starting PE was 978 and the ending KE was 978. When the mass was 60 kg the starting PE was 1468 and the ending KE was also 1468. This shows the relationship between mass, PE and, KE because an increases in mass resulted in an increase in starting PE and ending KE.
