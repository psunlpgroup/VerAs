My recommendation for the Gonzales family is to have the drop height at 5 meters. This is because when I tested the drop height at 5 meters, the PE was 2209 Joules at the top, and KE was 2209 Joules at the bottom. But when I put the drop height at 2 meters the PE was only 883 Joules at the top and the KE was only 883 Joules at the bottom. 5 meters would be my best recommendation because more PE makes it faster and more KE will keep it safe.      In my model the higher the KE and PE the higher the TE. This is because KE and PE equal TE. So I recommend a higher amount of PE and KE so there is more energy and velocity. One way to get high TE is to have a car with a big mass. I recommend a 60 kg car because in my simulation the PE was 2933 at the top and the KE was 1924 at the bottom. But with the 40 kg car the PE was 1955 and the KE was 1951. Once again we want high PE and KE so a 60 kg car would be best.

     In order to keep the coaster going the whole time we're going to need to have a hill height of around 3.5 meters. The hill needs to be smaller than the initial drop in order to make it to the very end of the ride. When I tried a 5 meter hill height the car didn't make it to the end because there wasn't enough energy. When the height was 3.5 meters the car made it to the end. As the car goes down the drop the PE will go down and the KE will go up. At the end of the drop the PE should start rising again in order to get up and down the hill. Another component of making it down the hill is conservation of energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be created nor destroyed. Meaning energy can change into non-mechanical types of energy. This means it is still present but it is useless for our roller coaster. If there is no friction the energy won't change into a different type. The coaster will continue going if PE and KE never transfer into different types of energy.
