Dear Gonzales family,
I recommend making the cart a higher mass to create more PE and KE. I found that 3.5 to 4 Meters was a safe drop point because the PE and KE weren't at an extreme amount. I also found that I couldn't get my car over a hill higher than 1720 PE and 239 KE at the top of a hill. The Energy transformation was higher when there was no hill or a smaller hill. Before the start of a drop, the KE was zero, but as the cart went down the hill the PE started to transfer to KE. Once the cart reached the bottom of the drop the PE was fully transferred to KE. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy was that total energy was the only energy that was the same as the PE at the top of the drop and the Ke at the bottom of the drop. The relationship between the drop height and the hill height was that the hill must be at least a little shorter than the drop height.
