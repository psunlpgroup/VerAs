The height of the initial drop will have to be 5 meters so there will be more PE and less KE. Also if you have a higher drop there will be more energy to get the cart to the end of the coaster. That way the PE can transfer into KE by the end of the coaster. 

The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is the more PE and KE you have the more your total energy will be.

As the coaster goes down the drop the PE transfers into KE.

The relationship between the drop height and hill height is that the hill has to be shorter than the drop because if it isn't the cart will not make it to the end.

The more mass your cart has the more PE and KE you will have so the more total energy you will have at the end of the coaster.
