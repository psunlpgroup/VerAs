The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because when you have a higher drop height and more cart mass the more potential energy the cart has at the top of the coaster. There more kinetic energy the cart has at the end of the coaster and the more total energy there is for the whole ride. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 977 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased to 2443 Joules. When the cart starts the PE starts higher than KE and as the cart continues through the track the KE goes up and the PE goes down and when the track ends there is more KE than PE. When there is a hill the cart slows because the is more friction as the cart goes up.
