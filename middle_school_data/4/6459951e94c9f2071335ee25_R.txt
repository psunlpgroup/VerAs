Roller Coaster Essay #1
During my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my findings about the following:
Gives you more energy how pe ke and total energy works more mass more the drop needs to be higher than the hill.

The drop height of my roller coaster design is  5 meters meters.
This is important because a 5-meter drop gives us the highest PE.

For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.5 meters, the PE was 1222 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased at  2443  Joules.

Potential energy plus kinetic energy equals total energy. 
My data supports this equation because, in the hill simulation, my coaster had 2444 J of PE at the top of the initial drop. It had 2444 J of KE at the bottom of the initial drop. It had 2444 J of total energy at the end of the ride.  the number of total energy that you start with is the energy  you wii end with.

The law of conservation of energy states that whatever energy you start with you end with. This means that energy will same start and end from P energy to K energy and back again throughout the ride.

Any hills that are added to the ride must be short compared to the initial drop height. 
You can see this in my data. When I tested a drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 5 m, the roller coaster car did not make it. However, when I tested a drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 2.5 m, the roller coaster car went over the hill .

Our last experiment was comparing mass and energy. The (higher/lower) the mass of the car, the (higher/lower) the total energy.
When I used a car that had a mass of 40 kg, the roller coaster had _1956 J of total energy. When I used a car that had a mass of _ 60 kg, the roller coaster car had a mass of 2934 kg.

In conclusion, from what weâ€™ve learned about the physics of roller coasters so far, your new roller coaster should have/do the following .
