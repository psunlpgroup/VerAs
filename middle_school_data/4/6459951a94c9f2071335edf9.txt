Dear Gonzales family,
 I want to help you in making the best roller coaster ever so listen. In the data that I recorded the car mass was 40 KG and the hill height was 5 meters high.
PE at the top of the hill is 1958  and your KE is 0 as you go down the hill the PE goes down to 0 and the KE goes to 1958.so in conclusion As we go down the hill the potential energy decreases and the kinetic energy increases and when we go back up the hill the kinetic energy decreases and the potential energy increases  

the total energy stays the same at 1958 because The Law of Conservation of Energy states that Energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can be convert from one type of energy to another. Mass can Effect KE and PE because when going down the hill the more mass the more energy when you go back up the less energy.
