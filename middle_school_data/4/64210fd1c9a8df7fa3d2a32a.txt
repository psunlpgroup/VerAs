I would recommend to not make the first loop or hill taller than the initial drop. Because if you make the first hill or first loop taller than the initial drop then the roller coaster will roll back down the hill or loop and it will not make it over. If the hill or loop is smaller though, then it will make it over the hill or loop. 

When the car is at the top of the initial drop then it has the most PE it will ever have. But if the car is halfway, then the KE and PE are about the same because of the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. 

PE and KE flip flop energy as the car is going down the hill. Because energy cannot be created or destroyed. The more mass the car has the harder it is going to be going up a hill. Because the more mass something has the heavier it is going to be because it weights more so it will not have enough speed to make it over the loop or hill because of gravity.  

If the car is lighter the easier it is going to be to get it to go up the hill or loop. Because it is lighter so it will not slow down as easy as the heavier one will. As the Initial drop height goes up, the more PE it will have. For instance at initial drop height: 2 the PE is 977, but at 3 it is 1466. And as it goes up the more PE it will have.
