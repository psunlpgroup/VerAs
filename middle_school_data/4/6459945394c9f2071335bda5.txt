My roller coaster will be the best option for the Gonzales family because it wont stop midway through and also has enough energy. First off the drop of my coaster is higher than any of the hills so it would never get stuck on any part and would safely make it to the end. For example when the initial drop was at 5 meters the and the hill was at 5 meters the car would never make it over because a cant carry enough speed up the hill. Secondly The whole coaster is down the hill besides for the one loop that means it will be able to make it to the end safely because the drop is higher. 

The coaster that i have designed would be the best for the Gonzales family also because it would be straight down the hill. this means The PE at the top would be high if the coaster is only downhill this means that it would carry a lot of speed along with being a scary ride but also no chance of getting stuck. 

Another reason this coaster should be a top pick for the Gonzales family is that it has loops and 90 degree drops which means it would be a ride that would be scary and fun for new customers. Finally this ride should be picked because of the safety and thrill it brings to the new riders
