Dear Gonzales family, the initial drop height of my roller coaster design is 3.5 meters. This is because I found that when the height of the initial drop increases, the potential energy at the top, and kinetic energy at the bottom increase. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the potential energy at the top was 1466J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1466J. When I increased the drop height to 3.5 meters, the potential energy at the top increased to 1714J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom increased to 1714J.

The hill height of my roller coaster design is 3 meters. This is because I found that when the height of the hill is higher than the height of the initial drop, the cart can’t make it to the end. For example, My initial drop height was 3.5 meters. When I tested the hill height of 4 meters, the cart couldn’t make it to the end. When I decreased the hill height to 3 meters, the cart was able to make it to the end.

The mass of my roller coaster design was 50kg. This is because I found that when the mass of the car increased, the potential energy at the top increased, and the kinetic energy at the bottom increased. For example, when the car mass was 40kg, the potential energy at the top was 1371J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1371J. When I increased the mass of the cart to 50kg, the potential energy at the top was 1714J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1714J.
