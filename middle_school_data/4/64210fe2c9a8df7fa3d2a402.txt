The drop height of my roller coaster is 5.00 meters. This is because the higher the drop, the more potential energy you will have. The more potential energy you have, the more total energy you have. Having a decent amount of total energy will make it easier for the cart to make it over the hill, and loop. Although, you don't want the drop height to be too large, or else the ride won't be safe. 
For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.00 meters, the potential energy was 876 joules. When I increased the drop height to 3.00 meters, the potential energy increased to 1319 joules.
I am going to put my hill height lower than my drop height. The reason I am doing this is because after the initial drop, there is only enough energy made to make it over a hill either the same size, or smaller than the initial drop. This way, the cart will still be able to make it over the hill, and it will also be a fun roller coaster.
