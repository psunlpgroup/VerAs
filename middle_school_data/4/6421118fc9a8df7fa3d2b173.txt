the drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the more height our coaster track had they more energy it had. For example, 5 meters will have more PE than an 3.5 initial drop.For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 2,199 joules. when I increased it the drop height to 5 meters the PE increased at 2443.  our total energy has been the same as The PE top of initial drop. For a car with 40kg as its mass it had a PE of 1,959 Joules and A car with 50kg of mass had  a PE of 2,448 Joules. This shows that a car with more mass has a higher KE and PE than one with less. 

Also The drop height has to be higher than the hill height because if the drop height it 4 and the hill height is 5 the car will get stuck at the top or wont be able to go over the hill.
