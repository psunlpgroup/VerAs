The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. I think it should be 5 meters because that is the max amount that we can go to still be safe. At 5 meters the cart has the most potential energy at 2707 J, which means that it will have the most total energy on the ride at 2707 J. Another important factor that makes the drop perfect is the fact that the cart goes the fastest, which makes it the most entertaining. For hills, I think a 4-meter hill would be perfect. I think this because it would give the riders the most suspense when they are going up the hill. This is because they are producing tons of potential energy when they are about to go down a 4-meter hill, 1919 J to be exact. 1919 J of potential energy will turn into 1919 J of kinetic energy thus making the riders go very fast. Lastly, for the mass of the car I was thinking 55 kgs, I think this is the perfect mass because it is safe and produces a lot more potential energy at the top than a lighter car would. When I tested it in the simulation I found that the car had 2712 J of potential energy. To put that in perspective when I tested a car 10 kg lighter it only had 2190, making it not as fun for the riders.
