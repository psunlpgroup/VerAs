The initial drop height should be 5 meters, because that is the tallest the initial drop height can be so it is the most fun for the passengers. So that the hill heights can be 4 meters, and the car will make it over the hill. If the initial drop height is the same or shorter than the hill height the car will not make it over the hill. The mass of the car should be the heaviest you can make it or about 60 kg.The heavier the mass of the car is the more potential and kinetic energy the roller coaster will have. The sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy added together equals the amount of total energy that the roller coaster has. Energy transformation is when the potential energy at the top of the hill is very high and has all of the energy so the kinetic energy is zero. As the car is going down the hill the potential energy changes to Kinetic energy. At the bottom of the hill the kinetic energy has all the energy and the potential energy is at zero. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be destroyed or created so when energy decreases it is not lost but changed. For example when there is friction and the potential energy is changing to kinetic energy. Some of that energy changes to thermal energy and that makes the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill less than the potential energy at the top of the hill. No matter the height of the initial drop the potential energy at the top of the hill and the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill do not change unless friction is added.
