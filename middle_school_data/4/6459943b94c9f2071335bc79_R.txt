When building this roller coaster, you will need to consider the initial drop height, the hills height, the mass of the cart and the total energy. All of these play a part in the cart making it to the end of the ride with out it needing to stop or fall back and try to restart. Lets talk about the initial drop height first. The higher the initial drop height, the more total energy there will be, which means there is a lot of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, (PE), and kinetic energy, (KE). At the top of the initial drop height, there will be an amount of PE, but as the cart moves down the drop the PE will be converted to KE. This is the process. The energy will always stay the same do to the law of conservation of energy, which says that energy can not be created nor destroyed, but can be converted to different types. Now, when you want to add a hill, you need to be aware of how tall it will be, or the cart might not be able to get over. For example, in the data we collected, when the initial drop height was 5 m and the hill height was 3.50 m, the cart was able to go over the hill with ease. But when the hill height was 5m as well, the cart was not able to to make it over the hill. This shows that the hill can not be the same height or higher then the initial drop. This is do to the total energy that is effected by the height of the initial drop, which means it only has enough total energy for going over hills that are smaller then the initial drop height, which in this case was 5 m. When it comes to mass, it has an effect on total energy as well. The more mass, the more total energy there is. For example, the initial drop height is set at 5 m, and the cart mass is 52 kg. The total energy was 2524 J. Then the cart weight was put at 56 kg, changing the total energy to 2740. This will help when considering hill height and the initial drop height.
