For what your requesting, I recommend we have a drop height of 5 meters. I recommend this for a couple of a different reasons, firstly, at this height, we will get the maximum amount of potential energy. Essentially the higher the drop the more potential energy. potential energy shows how many jules of energy the kart and the people in it will have. In order to fully make it through the ride we need alot  ofkinetic energy, and in order to get this needed energy we need potential energy. Which we obtain by having a high drop height. My second recommendation is a kart mass of 51kg, mass and energy have direct relationship. This relationship is shown in each one of my trials, for example, when the mass was 51kg it had the most amount of potential energy. kinetic energy and total energy so in order to make the ride fun and safe this is the best way to do it
