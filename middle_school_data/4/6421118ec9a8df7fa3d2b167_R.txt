Hi Mr. Gonzales thank you for taking the time to read this today. To hear why my roller coaster is safe. The drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters. Because that is the best solution with the KE and PE to work out the best. When the car is released from 5 meters the PE is 2932 joules and the KE 2930 at the end of the drop. Which for the roller coaster the total energy was 2932 joules. When you look at the relationship between KE and PE, it is related by when the initial PE is used it gets turned into KE. Which then the KE and PE adds up to the total energy. Then the total energy in the data table is the same as the PE at the start because that is the amount of energy there is.When car is going down the drop the PE is getting changed into the KE. This is because of the law of conservation of energy. Since it is being used when going down the hill. When the PE is being changed in KE it is because of energy transformation with the PE being used. Since the PE is being changed into KE. The initial drop height is 5 meters and the hill height is 3.75. When the trials were performed it worked out and the car was able to get over the hill from the initial drop height. The mass of the car was 58, 50, and 42 kilograms, and each time each car was able to get over the hill that was placed at 3.75. So with what we know so far the mass and height of the initial drop and the hill the mass did work out with the trials that were performed.  As you can see the roller coaster is safe to be put into any theme park. Because of all the research that I performed it is a really safe coaster to be put in a theme park. Thank you again for taking your time to read this today.
