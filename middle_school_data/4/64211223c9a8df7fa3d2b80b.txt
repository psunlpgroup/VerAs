I think having a starting height of 4 M would be good because, it would have enough energy to get over the hill. The hill would be at a height of 3 M so the cart could get over the hill. If you started at a height of 4 M the cart would have an easy time getting over it and still have a big enough energy to have fun. Starting at 4 M would give enough PE to get over and leave enough KE to keep going. The cart would need 60 KGs to be able to get over. The PE would change after the drop making it go faster. The reason that the drop height needs to be 4 M is because that the cart would go down but not over the hill. because your cant destroy energy the cart would keep moving for a while
