The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the higher the height the the more energy there with be. There will be more potential energy at the of the drop and more kinetic energy at the bottom of it. When I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the potential energy was 2445 joules. But when I increased the drop height to 5 meters the the potential energy was 2446 joules. Iv'e noticed that the potential and kinetic energy always added up to the total energy without friction. Something else I noticed was that going down the drop, the potential energy was changing into kinetic energy. I also learned that due to the law of conservation of energy, that energy can't be created or destroyed. So when it seemed that some of the energy was disappearing. It turned out that energy was just getting converted into thermal/heat energy and no energy had been destroyed. Proving that the total energy stayed the same through out the runs. My drop height was 5 meters and my hill height was 3.5 meters. So even with friction acting on my roller coaster. It was still able to get over the hill. Something else I learned is that the more mass my roller coaster has, the more energy it will also have. Meaning that if a 50 kg roller coaster at the top of the drop and hill will have more potential energy. And at the bottom of the drop and hill it will have more kinetic energy when compared to a roller coaster with only 40 kg.
