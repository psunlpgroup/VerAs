My proposal is this, you allow my team to give you an idea that could save your business  and open a new attraction to your park. my team has been working on this idea for a while now and we think you'll like it, it is called the Top Thrill Dragster. It involves science, technology, and physics and it will be able to make it to the end with pure thrill in the costumer's eyes. Our starting height of 4.5 m and car mass of 52 kg will always make it to the end of the ride with a hill in the middle of 4.25 m. With this height and mass, our ride starts with 2298 joules of PE, that changes to KE when at the bottom of the drop and making it over the hill and to the end with ease. The total energy of the ride being 2298, this does not change because the law of conservation energy stating "energy cannot be created nor destroyed." Even though PE and KE might change, this does not effect the total energy. The mass of the car, being 52 kg, makes it so it can make it over the hill because, the more mass you have, the more energy you have.
