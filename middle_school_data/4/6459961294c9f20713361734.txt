the roller coaster that would be the best fit for the Gonzales family is to have a roller coaster that has a initial drop that is higher than the hill. with  a car mass of 60, the roller coaster will make it all the way to the end and it will be fast and tall.from the data i collected, it showed that a car with 60 mass will have more PE when at the top of the hill and more KE at the bottom of the ride. when compared to the other masses that were tested, that has the most energy. the Gonzales wanted a ride with a hill taller than the initial drop, but from the data, the only car that didn't make it over was the hill with the same height as the initial drop. this means that if the hill was any higher it still wouldn't have made it over.  having a taller drop helps too if you want  more PE or KE. from my data , the highest i went for my ID was 5.00, that got me 2189 PE, and at the end if gave me the same, 2189. when the cart goes down the hill, the PE will turn into KE. this is because the PE is stored and when released the PE turns into KE . total energy is when you get the total PE at the start of the ID, and when you stop the cart at the tip of the hill, the KE and PE will equal the PE at the ID.
