We have made a well-designed roller coaster with many hills, loops, and drops. It can easily make it from start to finish and will be a thrilling ride for passengers. The science behind a roller coaster is that the potential energy that a roller coaster cart has at the top of the initial drop will be transferred into kinetic energy as it drops down into a loop. Then it will gain some potential energy back from gaining height while in the loop. Then that potential energy transfers back to kinetic energy as it comes out of the loop. That kinetic energy will transfer back into potential energy if the cart goes up a hill, and will return to kinetic energy as the ride finishes. As long as the loop is not as tall as the initial drop the cart should be able to make it. If you have a hill after the loop, it needs to be shorter than the loop to be able to make it up. The more mass the cart has, the more potential energy the cart will have because the formula for potential energy is mass * gravity * height. The reason that the loop or hill can't be higher than the initial drop is because you cannot create energy and you would have to create energy to make it up a hill or loop that is taller than the initial drop.
