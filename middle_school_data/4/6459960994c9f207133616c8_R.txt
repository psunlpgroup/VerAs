 here i will be listing reasons why you should use MY design for your roller coaster, with my three main points being that it is speedy, actually works, and can get to the end.

my first point is how fast it can go (without being dangerous). Its total energy is 2446, and when all of that is kinetic energy (or ke, for short), it can go pretty fast! most people like faster rollercoasters, so my design uses a high drop height for maximum energy output. speed relies on mass and total energy (and gravity, and the coasters have a mass of 50kg plus the initial drop height is very vertical which makes it speed up faster.

my next point about it actually working is that it has a large loopdeloop!!! Almost as big as the initial drop height actually. But, because it isn’t as big, it has enough kinetic energy to make it all the way around since if it was as tall as the drop, it would have used all of its energy reaching the top then going back down the way it came. but, since it doesn't, it then regains the energy by going back right-side-up after rolling back down the other way. because it regains that energy of the drop, it’s able to go over an equally tall hill.

this isn’t done dont kill me
