The roller coaster must have an initial drop .higher than the hill, or else the cart will not make it to the end. The hill also cannot be the same height as the initial drop, because it will also roll back if that's the case. This is becau.se of the energy. The t.otal energy will stay the same throughout the entire ride, (Conservation of Energy). But PE and KE will swap around depending on what the roller coaster is doing. At the top of the initial drop, all of the energy is PE, while at the end of the roller coas.ter all of the energy is KE. When the roller coaster cart goes down the initial drop, the PE transforms into KE.

There's also something. similar with mass, which is the higher the mass of the cart the more PE it will have. This also means that it. will have more KE when it goes down the initial drop, and subsequently the hill. That is shown by t.he data in the mass & energy section of the notebook. A car weighing 60kg had 2934 Joules of energy.
