Hello, Mr. Gonzales. However, that sounds like a blast; it wouldn't be safe for our riders. Our initial drop would have to be significantly higher than our hill height so the coaster has enough energy to make it to the end. in the Law Conservation of Energy it states: energy cannot be created nor destroyed, so If the hill height is any taller than the initial drop, unfortunately there won't be enough momentum to get it to the end.   If we wanted the hill to be pretty high, based on my data the cart mass would have to be high. With the car mass of 51 (our largest trial) there was more PE at the initial drop meaning the cart could have enough momentum to get to the bottom. With a smaller hill height the more momentum and the higher we can make the next hill because of all the PE to keep going. With all of this combined I think we will make a great coaster that will be safe and enjoyable to all riders!
