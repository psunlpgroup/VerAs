Hi Mr.Gonzales, here are how I would design the roller coaster for your families theme park.  The initial drop height must be higher then all of the other hills and loops on the roller coaster.  This is because the initial drop decides the potential energy which is the stored energy in an object.  This stored energy will change states into kinetic energy once it starts moving.  The kinetic energy is what will take the car through the roller coaster.  
                The kinetic and potential energy combined is called the total energy.  The total energy will always stay the same because due to the law of conservation of mass that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.  This is shown by the total energy never changes just how much of each type of energy is what changes.  The total energy is how much energy your roller coaster will have to be able to make it to the end of the track.
                  If you want to have more energy and more speed then you would want a car with more mass.  I know that mass affects energy because in my trials I found that if you increased the mass then the total energy would also increase.  For example when the car was kg then the total energy was 1857 joules on a 4.75 meter drop.  On that same drop but with a car which the mass was 60 kg the total energy was 2785 joules.  This helps with your roller coaster because mass effects energy and how energy affects your roller coaster I explained in the previous paragraph.
              I hope that this essay helped your understand how physics will impact the design of your roller coaster.
