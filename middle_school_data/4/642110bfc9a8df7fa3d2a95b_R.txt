Dear Gonzales family,
  I have been working on the roller coaster design for a few days now; this is what my data tells me. for the initial drop, I think it should be as high as possible because we want lots of potential energy and at the bottom we also want lots of kinetic energy to get to the first hill quickly. The relationship between height and PE is direct because when the height goes up so does potential energy. Because the law of conservation says you can't create or destroy energy so we need the bigger hill as the start. We want to get up the first hill quickly so we don't end up stopping or the car starts to go backward and eventually stop altogether. We also need to make the first hill less than five so the car can get up and over the hill again without going backward. we don't want to use much energy on the first hill so there is enough energy to make it through the whole ride. The mass of the car should be 60 because the relationship between the mass of the car and PE is a direct relationship so when the mass goes up so does the PE so the cart will go faster. It is the same with mass and KE because the bigger the mass, the more KE it has, so it goes much faster. The total energy is the total of PE and KE and it always stayed the same because of the relationship between PE and KE the total energy will never change. There will also be PE at the top of the hill but very little at the bottom and the same with KE
