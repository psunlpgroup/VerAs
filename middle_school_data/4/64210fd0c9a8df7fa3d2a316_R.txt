The drop height is going to be 5 because that will give it enough energy to make it over the hill. The height of the drop relates to the potential energy at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom because the higher the drop height the more PE and KE. The bigger the mass the more PE the coaster will have. The PE at the top of the initial drop is the same as the total energy. When the car mass was 50 the totel energy was 1958 at the top and bottom so it never changed. The KE at the bottom is super close to the PE at the top of the hill. As the cart goes down the hill it gets less PE and gains more KE. The reason the PE at the top of the drop is the same as the total energy is because energy can not be created or destroyed because that is what the law of conservation of energy says. 
The drop height also has to be bigger then the hill height or else the cart won't have enough energy to make it over the hill. The larger the mass the slower the cart is so if you have to much mass it also won't make it over the hill. If the initial drop is not big enough then the cart wont make it over the hill but if the hill height is to big the cart also wont make it over the hill.
