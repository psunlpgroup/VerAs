I would recommend after the study's and data i have collected. I recommend that the initial drop must be taller than the hill because,if the hill is larger than the initial drop then the car will not make it over the hill and will fall back down.The reason that would happen is because the car dose not have enough potential energy to make it up the hill. And when that potential energy changes and becomes kinetic energy and dose not have enough of either to make it up and over the hill.The mass of the car matters to because that will effect the potential energy at the top of the hill, if the car is heavier than it will have more potential energy than if the car was really light.to conclude my recommendation.The initial drop needs to be taller than the first hill for the car to keep going and for it to be safe.The mass of the car also matters because it will give you more or less mass depending on how heavy the car is
