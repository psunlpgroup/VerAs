I think the initial drop should be 5 meters, the hill height should be 4 meters and the car mass be 60.
 The 5 meter start height will give the car enough potential energy to not only finish but also do it fast and fun. The higher the initial drop is, the more potential energy the car will have. We started with 5 meters and kept going down by a meter. And we noticed the total energy went from 2668 to 2134J then went lower and lower each time we went down.
The hill height set to 4 meters will also add more excitement while also being shorter than the initial drop, If the hill height was higher than the initial drop, the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it up the hill.  And putting the hill height to 4 or less it would make it over, but 4 adds the most excitement and speed. In our experiment 2152J was the most energy out of all the hill heights and we got it from 4 meters. And since we are making an original roller coaster in the sence of only reliing 
The car mass as 60 will add to the speed of the coaster and make the ride more exciting.  Mass is both in kinetic and potential energy's' formulas so the more mass you have the faster it will go because the total energy will be higher. In all of our experiments the both mass & height had a direct relationship with energy. For mass we started with 60kg and went down from there to 40 and every time the total energy shrunk. It started as 2934 all the way down to 1956J.
