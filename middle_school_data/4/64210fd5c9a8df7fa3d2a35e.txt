The initial drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters tall. This is because the higher the initial drop the more PE. For example when I tested the initial drop of 5 meters I got a PE (potential energy). Of 2443 Joules compared to my test of 4 meters which had a PE that decreased to 1955 Joules. At the bottom of the 5 meters the KE was 2442 Joules, and the drop height of 4 had a KE of 1954 Joules. But the total energy will always stay the same as energy can be created or destroyed. The PE and KE change and transfer to one another but never is destroyed. As it goes down the drop the PE will convert in to KE.  In addition, if you where to add a hill would need to be lower than the initial drop. Because if the hill is the same or taller than the initial drop the car wouldn't have the energy to make it up the hill. The height of my hill was 4 meters because it was the highest I could have before it wouldn't make it over the hill because of the height. For example with a hill height of 4 meters I got a PE of 1963 Joules. It got all the way to the end. My second test failed as I tested the hill height of 5 meters and it wasn't able to make it up and over the hill. The PE was always less than the initial drop so it can make it over the hill. The KE was less too but still the PE and KE would inter change with each other. All of these tests were done in a friction less environment. I know that in the real world there is friction to account for. Friction will take some energy away from the car as it moves. where the energy goes is in thermal and sound energy among multiple of different types of energy.
