Dear. Gonzales Family, the drop is going to be 5m because the total energy is substantial to the height of the hill.  When the car mass is 50 the PE top of the initial drop (5m) would be 1958 J and KE bottom of Drop would be 1955 J. The total energy would be 1958 which would be good because the car would not need friction to get over the kill which would make it very fun for customers. No energy is created or destroyed so what happens to the mass at the bottom? It transfers to thermal energy. The drop height and hill height of the track is related because the drop is a measure of energy and the hill is a measure of PE. KE and PE are the amount of energy in the sim, which means the mass depends on KE and PE. This our idea Gonzales family.
