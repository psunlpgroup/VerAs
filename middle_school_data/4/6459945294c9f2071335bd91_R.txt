Dear Gonzales family from my trials the initial drop must be higher than the hill because the data show that 5 meters initial drop can't go over 5 meters hill but it could go over 3.75 meters so the hill has to be smaller that 5 meters and the car mass matters
It's imported to consider the PE and the KE  because they are both connected to each other so your PE can be turn into KE so if your PE is 2932 so your KE should be 2932 and PE and KE equal to total energy so the rides total energy should be 2932.
