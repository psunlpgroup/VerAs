The roller coaster should have a mass that is at least 60 kilograms) the initial drop at 5 meters, and a hill height of 4 meters to make it more fun. Potential energy and kinetic energy have an inverse relationship. One example of this from my data (initial drop height) is at the top of the initial drop (2 meters) the potential energy was  977 J. While at the bottom it was 0 J. The kinetic energy at the bottom was 977 J but while it was at the top it was zero. The potential energy transferred to kinetic energy. The law of conservation of energy also pertains to when you're going down the initial drop, the energy transfers from potential energy (at the top of the initial drop) to kinetic energy (at the bottom of the initial drop) while going down. Which is relevant to the law of conservation of energy which states that energy will not be created or destroyed, just transferred. The height of the initial drop also plays into the energy because according to my data, while the release height was 2 meters the total energy was 977 J while at 5 meters the total energy was 2,442 J. The hill height has to be lower than the initial drop height because if it's not it will not be able to go over the hill. My evidence of this is in my data. When the hill height was the same as my initial drop height which is 5 meters high, the cart did not go over the hill it just kept going back and fourth. However, when the hill height was 3 meters high it went over the hill. The mass of the cart is also important for energy. According to my data when the car mass was 40 kilograms the total energy was 1,955. While when the mass was 60 kilograms, the total energy was 2,932. So one way to control energy is by adding more mass. If you have less mass, you can risk the cart not going fast enough to make it up the hill, and it likely wouldn't be fun or very safe.
