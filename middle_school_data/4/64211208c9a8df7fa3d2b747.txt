To the Gonzales family these are my recommendations to make the best roller coaster for your amusement park. Let's start with the initial drop, I would recommend making your initial drop 5 meters high so the cart starts off with enough potential energy to get threw the whole ride. Our data showed that the higher the cart is the more potential energy it starts off with making the roller coaster faster and it would be able to make it threw the entire ride. Now lets talk about the hill, The hill has to be lower than 5 meters or else the cart won't make it over the hill. Our data showed that if you want to make the hill 4.9 meters you can do that it just can't be 5 meters or else it won't make it over the hill Because it won't have enough kinetic energy to get all the way up that hill. I would recommend making the hill 3 meters high so the cart has some speed going over the hill and it would still be fun to go over the hill. Now what should the weight of the car be? Our data showed that the higher the mass of the car the more potential kinetic and total energy the car had meaning more speed. I would recommend making the mass of the car 60 kg because that's what our data showed was the best option. Those are my recommendations for the roller coaster.
