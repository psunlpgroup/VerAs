The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because i would want to have the roller coaster to go faster because i think that roller coasters are better when they go faster. For example when i tried the drop height of 5 meters the potential energy was 2932 joules when i decreased the drop height to 2 meters the potential energy decreased to 1173 joules. The relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy and total energy is potential energy is the amount of energy when a object is still. Kinetic energy is the amount of energy when a object is moving and total energy is potential energy and kinetic energy added together. The changes between potential energy and kinetic energy when it is going do a hill is a ton of changes. When the car is going down the hill the potential energy starts to decrease and then the kinetic energy starts to go up while the total energy does not change. When you had a higher initial drop then the hill height and then the car will make it over the hill when they are the same then the car might not make it over the hill. The relationship between mass potential energy and kinetic energy matters. The higher mass you have the more potential energy you will have. Then that will mean that the kinetic energy will be more. The energy transformation and law of conservation of energy are where the total energy changes because of friction and then the leftover energy will go to thermal energy and sound energy.
