The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because  if the height Is higher it will give the cart more energy and momentum. For example when I tested the drop height of 5 meter the PE was  2443  Joules. When I decreased the drop height to 4 meters the PE decreased to 1955 Joules. The energy when the initial drop was smaller went down a lot. But when the initial drop was higher the energy went up. PE and TE may change depending on the  KE. KE and TE are usually not the same because the TE is PE + KE = TE. 
The change in PE and KE when going down the hill is when you first go down the hill it is a higher PE. But as soon as go down the hill the PE gets lower and the KE goes down one from one from the PE. The drop height is  taller then the hill height. So the drop height will give more energy to go over hills. Mass is how much something weighs. PE and KE are both types of energy, mass gives the KE and PE energy to go faster or slower.
