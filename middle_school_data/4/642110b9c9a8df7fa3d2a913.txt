Dear Gonzales Family,

My team's coaster will be a brilliant addition to your theme park because it uses the laws of physics to make it the most fun and exciting coaster ever. First off, our coaster will have the tallest initial drop possible. Having the initial drop so tall will make this coaster have the most potential energy it can possibly have, which makes the kinetic energy go up since it makes the velocity go up. This is possible because velocity is included in the kinetic energy formula, which is KE= 1/2 X M X V2. The second reason is that the car will have a very big mass. This will improve the ride experience because the more mass there is the more energy. You can see how this is proved in the data we got from our sim. When the mass was 50kg, the total energy was 1222. When the mass was 60kg, the total energy was 1466. When the mass was 40kg, the total energy was 977. In summary, the total energy was highest when the mass was highest. The third and last reason is that it strategically adds hills so that they are a tiny bit smaller than the initial drop, so that the ride can have the maximum height, length, and craziness. It is required to have hills smaller than the initial drop because of the laws of physics. When the car is on top of the initial drop, the potential energy is the greatest because you haven't started moving yet and there is 0 kinetic energy. When you go onto a hill, you are already moving and cannot come to a stop unless you fall back down the hill, and some of that potential energy is still in it's kinetic form. That is why you should use my groups roller coaster design for your new w roller coaster. Thank you for your time.
