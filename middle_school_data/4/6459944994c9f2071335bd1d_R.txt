Dear, Gonzales family.

the roller coaster design I have come up with will be a great addition to the park. As my roller coaster is long, scary, exciting, and has tons of inversions, a huge hill, and a corkscrew. The coaster will be made from titanium and the cart will be made from wood and weigh around 60kg This is important because the heavier the cart the more potential energy there is. We will drop from a world-record height of 600 feet. At the top of the initial drop, there will be a large number of total energy all of which is potential energy because of how high it is and because of how much the cart weighs. As the cart drops the potential energy will transform into kinetic energy because energy is never created or destroyed. When the cart reaches the bottom of the drop it has tons of kinetic energy. This allows it to make it to the top of the 500-foot hill because since the initial drop is higher than the hill the cart will be able to get over the hill. Then it will go through 2 loops each one higher than the one before so the cart can make it to the end. I look forward to making this roller coaster with you in the future.
