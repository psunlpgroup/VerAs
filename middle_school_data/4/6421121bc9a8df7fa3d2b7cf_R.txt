The first thing I would recommend to the Gonzales family is to have a high initial drop. I recommend this because the higher the hill, the higher the potential energy is. The more potential energy there is, the more kinetic energy there is at the bottom of the hill, and the more kinetic energy, the faster the coaster is. When the roller coaster is going down the hill, the potential energy transfers into kinetic energy until the coaster reaches the bottom of the drop. Also, the kinetic and the potential energy added together is the total energy. Another thing I would recommend to the Gonsales family is to have a hill lower than the initial drop. I recommend this because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, so if the hill was higher than the initial drop, the coaster would not have enough energy to make it over the hill. Another thing to note is that the more mass you have, the more potential energy you have, and the more kinetic energy you have. So, therefore, the Gonzales family should also have a heavier coaster because that means the coaster will go faster.
