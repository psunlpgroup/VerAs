The drop height of 5 worked best for me because it created the most PE and was the easiest to get over the hills. For example when my drop height was at 5, my PE was 1955 at the start of the drop. But when my release height was only at 2 the PE at the top of initial drop was only 782 and was harder to get up hills and make it to the end successfully. During the start of the cart the PE was 1955 and when it began to go down the hill the PE amount would switch. The KE amount, and once the cart got to the top of the hill the KE would switch to the PE. By the end of the ride the KE was at 0 and my PE was at 1955 the total energy at the end of the ride was also 1955. Because there no longer was any KE so the total amount was the amount of PE. When the cart was going through energy transformation the cart would not stop if energy transformation continuted to happen and would never actually stop. For the cart to stop the PE needed to stop and there needed to be no KE. For me and my group we decided that the best way we could transfer energy and store more was to make small hills that the cart could speed through and end with the most amount of KE. For example our smallest hill was 2 m  and our KE at the top of the hill was 1462, but when our highest hill that was 5 m the KE at the top of the hill was only 602.  When we had more car mass our PE was higher. For example, our biggest car mass was 60 and our PE ended as 2936, and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 2930.
