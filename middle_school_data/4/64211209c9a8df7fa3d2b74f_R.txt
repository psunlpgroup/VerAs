At the start of your roller coaster, you will have the initial drop. The higher the initial drop the more potential energy there is. Potential energy is due to the position of the object, therefore when we increase the height of the initial drop the potential energy is increased. The higher the initial drop the more kinetic energy there will be. For example, at the bottom of the initial drop we can see that there was 977 J of kinetic energy when the release height was 2.00 meters and that when the height increased to 5.00 m, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J. The total energy is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. The total energy will remain constant throughout the ride, but the energy will transition from potential energy to kinetic energy, and thermal energy if friction is added. Along with that, we can see that the potential energy transfers to kinetic energy due to its motion. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that the total energy of a system stays the same. The next thing we noticed is the relationship between the kill height and the initial drop height. The hill height must be shorter than the initial drop height for the cart to make it through the ride. In an experiment I did, I noticed that if the initial drop was 4.00 meters the hill height had to be 3.99 meters or less. This shows how we need to have the initial drop height be taller than the height of the hill.
