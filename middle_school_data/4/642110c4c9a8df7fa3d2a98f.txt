Dear, Gonzales family I would recommend that you make the initial drop bigger so then you have more PE going down, therefore, it is more fun for your riders and data shows that the bigger your initial drop the more PE and KE you have. My data shows when I had the car start at 5cm the PE was 2443 and when you started at 2 it was only 977 so starting with a bigger drop gives you more energy and it will be more fun for your riders.
