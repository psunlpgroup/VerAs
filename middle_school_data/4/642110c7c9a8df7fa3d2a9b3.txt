To get the maximum energy for the initial drop, I recommend having the height at 5 meters, the tallest. At the top of the drop, there is only PE and no KE, but at the bottom there is no PE but only KE. This is because PE converts to KE when it is going down the coaster. Also, KE and PE will always add up to the total energy because it has a direct relationship with total energy. I tested out different heights for the initial drop and always found that the more height, the more potential and kinetic energy. This is because PE and KE have a direct relationship with the height of the initial drop. From my data, when I tested out 3 meters it's total energy was 1465 J. When I tested out 5 meters, it's total energy was 2442 J. 
For adding a hill, the height can't be 5 meters because that is the same as the initial drop and it doesn't have enough energy to reach 5 meters. But, I think the height could be around 3.25 meters so it makes it past the hill but still makes energy. Since I tested this out being friction-less, potential or kinetic energy converted into heat or thermal energy, but in real life it would, that is why I wouldn't have it at like 4.9. Having a taller hill will have more energy than having a shorter hill, and I tested this out. When I had a 2.5 meter hill, the total energy was 2444 J. When I had a 3.25 meter hill, the total energy was 2450. 
Having a higher car mass has more total mass than having a low mass, I think the car mass should be 50. Mass and PE, and KE have a direct relationship and I tested this out using the simulation. When the mass was 40 kg the total energy was 1955. When the mass was 60 kg, the total energy was 2932.
