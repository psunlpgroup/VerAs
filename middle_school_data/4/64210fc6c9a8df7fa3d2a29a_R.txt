My recommendation is to start with the initial drop at 5 ft. I think this because then we can add a hill whatever size below it. The higher the hill the ore PE you will have. For example if the hill is 5 ft we have a 2443 PE at the top of the hill. but if we have a 3 ft hill then the PE would be 1466. Then there will be more speed and more TE. After the initial drop we should add a hill that is 3 ft high. It works well with the 5 ft drop because it is smaller than the drop so it wont need the energy we dont have to get up the hill and make it over. Like the law states energy can not be created or destroyed it can only transform from one energy to another. So when there is PE at the top of the hill and the car goes down, it forms into KE. Fo example 977 PE at the top of the hill and when  The total energy that we have at the top of the hill is the same through out the entire ride, it never changes. The mass of the car should be at least 50 kg because the more mass there is the more PE there is and we need a lot of energy to be able to get the coaster through the whole ride. i tested this stuff without friction obviously that's not possible in the real world. but in the real world the PE would be high but then when it got to the bottom and it formed into KE there would be less KE then there was PE at the initial drop.
