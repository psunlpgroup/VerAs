Dear, Gonzales family

Here is the roller coaster design that our team has decided on.

First of all, the initial drop height will be 5 meters tall, to ensure there is enough energy for the ride. We have noticed that the height is directly related to PE and KE, so the total energy will be directly effected by the PE and KE. Height and velocity have a direct relationship, which means height effects velocity. We know that when height is increased so will velocity. In our data, we used a car that had a mass of 60kg on a 5 meter track the total energy was 2932 J. This shows that when there were more people in the car the faster it goes, it also shows that mass directly relates to total energy. Also the energy is turning into thermal energy because of friction, this relates to the law of conservation of energy because energy can neither be created nor destroyed only converted from one form of energy to another. The initial drop and hill height have direct relationship because when the initial drop decreases so does the hill height and vice versa. For example, the hill height was 5 meters and the initial drop was 2443 J then in another trial the hill height was 4.15 meters then the initial drop was 2027 J.
