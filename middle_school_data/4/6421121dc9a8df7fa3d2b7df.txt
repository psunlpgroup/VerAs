The roller coaster must have an initial drop taller than the hill that way the car can carry enough KE to get up the hill. If the car does not have enough KE you will get some bad reviews. for example when we tried to have a taller hill then drop the car lost all KE and did not make it to the end how ever when the hill was any shorter it worked. For example in one of the trails the drop height was 4 meters hill height was 3.5 meters. a little bit more on Law of conservation of energy it states that all energy you had at the start you will have at the end for example in our trails the car had the same total energy. When the car is going down the hill it turns all the potential energy into KE (energy in motion).The more mass you have the faster the cart will go making it a more enjoyably experiences for the riders.
