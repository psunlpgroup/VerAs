The roller coaster has to have enough mass to create enough energy in the height drop to make it through the loops. The height drop has to be taller than all of the other drops so it has enough energy to get there and through all of them. The ride will be exciting because of all the drops and loops. With the tall height drop to start, it will quickly pick up speed which riders will enjoy. We did trials to test what mass would be best for the roller coaster design, so I am confident we have the correct design for you.
