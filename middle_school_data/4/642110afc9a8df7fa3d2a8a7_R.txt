Hello Gonzales family, I am writing this letter to share or recent roller coaster design. Our current design contains of an initial drop of 5 meters, then the ride will continue through a loop then carry on to a hill that leads into the ending hill. I recommend that the initial drop is the highest hill there is in the ride because if there is another one that is bigger, the ride wont have enough potential energy to climb it. I also recommend that most of the drops are still pretty high though so the coaster stays fast throughout the ride. The height of a hill changes the potential energy which then converts into kinetic energy, and this all effects the speed of the ride. You must be aware of the potential energy and the kinetic energy on the ride. At the top of the hill all of the total energy will be stored energy, also known as potential energy. But as the cart goes down the hill, that energy will be converted to kinetic energy. The total energy should always equal the kinetic energy and potential energy put together. But this can change depending on the frictions of the ride. Also you should have the mass of the car to be heavier rather than lower. The more the mass means more energy. Those are all my recommendations for you guys and I hope you are able to make a great roller coaster.
