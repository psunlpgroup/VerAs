Dear Gonzales family,

 My engineering group and  I have decided to make the initial height 5 meters. This is because if it were to be 4 meters tall the thrill would decrease so would the safety, and it wouldn’t have enough total energy to make it over the hill. It would then go back down. But since we decided to make the hill also 5 meters tall, the cart had to be a lighter weight to make the cart go over it we had to decrease the weight of the cart to 40.
The reason we had to decrease the cart weight is that if it's heavier than 40, it would make the total energy would decrease, slowing it down. The reason we made the hill the same length as the drop, was so the thrill was a good amount. 
Our first idea was to make the hill height smaller than the drop so we wouldn’t have to decrease the weight of the cart as much, but the problem with that is the speed, the more weight there is the slower it would move. But if we decrease the weight the faster it would go due to the amount of potential and kinetic energy there is. But as the cart goes down the potential and kinetic energy would switch numbers. like if the potential energy was 1714 and it went down to the end of the track, the kinetic energy would then be 1714. And the potential energy would be 0.
