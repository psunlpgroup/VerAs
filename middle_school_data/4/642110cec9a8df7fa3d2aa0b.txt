dear Gonzales family I have some ideas for your rollercoaster.  I think the height of the initial drop should be 3.75 meters. I think this because the jewels of energy are a total of 1832 jewels of PE at the top of the drop.  Then when you are a the bottom of the drop you have 1832 jewels of KE. This is because the PE at the top is converted to KE at the bottom. this is because they are an inverse relationship. So the total amount of energy is 1832 jewels. The hill height should be 2.5 meters tall. This is because the height of the hill has to be shorter than the initial drop. If the hill is taller then the roller coaster will not have enough total energy to get up and make it back down the hill.  I think the mass of the car should be 50kg. It is because the mass of the car and the drop have a direct relationship. So the greater the mass of the car the greater the total energy. For example, a 50kg car has
