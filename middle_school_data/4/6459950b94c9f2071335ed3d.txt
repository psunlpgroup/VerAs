Hello Gonzales Family, this roller coaster design will be fun and exciting to ride. The more total energy the roller coaster has the faster the roller coaster will be.

 When making this roller coaster you would need an initial drop to begin the ride. The higher the drop the more KE and PE there will be making it go faster. The total energy is also going to be greater or less depending on how high you make it. I suggest 5.00 m.The PE changes from KE when the cart goes down the initial drop. Wen at the top of the drop there is NO KE and all of the energy is the PE. But when the cart starts to move the PE changes into KE and at the bottom there is only KE.

 After you add the initial drop you can add a hill. The hill will be right after the initial drop. If the hill is higher than the initial drop, the cart will not be able to make it over the hill. If the hill is smaller then the initial drop the cart will be able to make it over the hill. The best height of a hill would be 4.25 or 4.75. If you look at the data on the 5.00 hill, the cart did not make it over. But if you look at the 4.25 the cart did make it over. When the cart goes up the hill the KE from the initial drop will change back to PE because it is going up and slowing down, but when it starts going down the PE changes BACK to KE. 

After you add an initial drop and a hill, you would have to figure out what the mass of your cart will be. The more the mass is the more total energy it will have. When the cart is lighter it will have less total energy. So if you have a lighter cart it will not go as fast up and going down the hill because in the data table the car mass was at 40 kg and the PE at the top was 1958 J. At the bottom of the hill the KE was 1942 J. But when the cart mass was 60 the total energy was higher and when the cart was at the top the PE was 2937 J and when the cart was at the bottom of the drop it was 2925 J. These all come together to make the roller coaster fast and fun for the rider.
