I think your roller coaster should have an initial drop of about 5 meters. I think this because the higher the drop the faster the ride and the more fun. I know this because the height of the initial drop has a direct relationship with the potential energy at the top of the drop. Meaning when there is more height there is more potential energy at the top of the drop and the other way around. Also, the height of the initial drop has a direct relationship with the kinetic energy at the bottom. If you want to figure out the total energy you just go to any spot on the ride and add up the PE and the KE. Also, the relationship between mass and PE at the top of the initial drop is direct, As well as KE at the bottom of the Drop has a direct relationship with mass. Meaning the more mass the more TE. One more thing, The reason that PE at the top of the drop is not always the same as the KE at the bottom of the drop is that some of the energy gets turned into Heat. Also, this relates to the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
