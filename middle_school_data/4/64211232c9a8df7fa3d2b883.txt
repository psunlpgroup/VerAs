When building a rollercoaster you can't put a track with a loop and a hill expecting the cart to make it to the end. 

When you first start your rollercoaster there has to be a drop deep enough to make the cart move on the tracks, Having your hill be higher than the initial drop is not safe.
If your hill is too big the cart won't make it over the hill and reach the end of the ride. 

The higher the release height, the more PE you will get, the same with the KE at the bottom of the ride. 

When trying out your roller coaster you will notice that when you start the ride there is no KE but as the cart goes down the PE turns into KE.
The same thing happens when you go up a hill the KE goes back into PE.
