Hello, I've been working on rollercoaster research for the past few weeks. I recommend having a drop height of 5 meters as it will give the car the most potential energy possible. The drop height and potential energy have a direct relationship. When the drop height increases the potential energy increases. Having high potential energy also means high kinetic energy. Potential energy and kinetic energy also have a direct relationship, meaning when the potential energy is increased the kinetic energy is also increased. It's the same between kinetic energy/potential energy and total energy. The total energy is also increased when the kinetic energy/ potential energy is increased. My data shows when the car drop was 2 meters the total energy was 977 joules. When the drop was increased to 5 meters the total energy was 2443 joules. I believe the roller coaster should also have a 3-meter hill. A 3-meter hill will give the riders a thrill without the car losing too much energy to friction and gravity. My research supports this, When the hill was 2 meters tall the kinetic energy at the top of the hill was 1472 joules. When the height was increased to the same height as the initial drop of 5 meters the car had 0 kinetic energy at the top of the hill and did not finish while the 2-meter hill did. It is important to remember that the conservation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This means that the car will not have the same amount of kinetic energy at the end of the track as the potential energy at the top of the drop because the potential energy is transferred into heat energy. lastly, I recommend the car be 60 kilograms as this would give the car the most potential energy and kinetic energy. My data supports this when the mass of the car was 40 kilograms the total energy was 1564 joules, when the car mass was increased to 58 kilograms the total energy was 2267 joules.
