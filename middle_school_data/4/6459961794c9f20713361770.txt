The recommendations i would have for the Gonzalez family. A big drop and a slightly smaller hill because i have learned that if the drop and the hill are the same height the car will not have enough energy to make it up the hill. But If the drop is higher than the hill it will have more potential energy. Making the speed and kinetic energy higher to make it over the hill. Lets talk about the relationship between Pe, Ke and total energy. They contribute to one of another the potential energy contributes to how much kinetic energy it will have. I know this because when we tested the height of the drop the potential energy would get higher or lower the kinetic energy would differ as well making the car go faster or slower depending on the drop. The total energy stays the same as the potential this is because the law of conservation of energy says energy cannot be created or destroyed. But energy cane transfer through things that how the potential and kinetic energy change through out the drop. Now lets talk about the mass of the car. The mass determines how much energy the care will have with out mass the car will not be able to get up the hill because the speed is to little which make the kinetic energy lower witch make the speed decrease.
