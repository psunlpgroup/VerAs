Dear Gonzalez Family,
       During the Roller coaster and energy analysis, we learned about PE and KE at the top of and throughout roller coasters.
     I believe we should make a roller coaster with a release height of 5m. This is the initial drop. We want a higher initial drop because that will create a higher PE. I know this because when I tried it with a drop height of 5m the PE was 2444J. The KE will always be 0 at the top of the initial drop. 
    The higher the PE and KE higher the total energy will be. With higher energy, it will be more of an interesting ride for riders. With more PE it will give the cart more energy to get over hills or loops. Gonzalez family should make a hill height of around 4.51m. I believe they should do this because they will have enough KE from the initial drop to get around the hill.
    The car changes because when the car goes downhill PE and KE stays the same. This is because energy cannot be created or destroyed. That is called the Law of Conservation.
   In the end,  PE and KE can't be created or destroyed. And at the top of the hill PE is always higher than KE and PE and KE always equal the total energy.
