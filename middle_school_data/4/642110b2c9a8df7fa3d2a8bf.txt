Hello, our roller coaster will be the most fun and safe. The reason why is because there is a big drop at the start, this drop contains a lot of potential energy, and with our research this potential energy converts to kinetic energy as the cart goes down. And since our coaster contains a lot of potential energy at the start it will reach a high kinetic energy or speed as it goes down. But the speed it reaches can not exceed the energy at the start if you do not use energy from external sources, this is because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that we cannot create or destroy energy. So we cannot add or remove energy from the total energy amount. And the roller-coaster.
will make it over the loops and hills because, when you go down you gain potential energy and when you go up you use potential energy, so if we go down the initial drop we gain 10 joules of potential energy. But when we go up the hill and over we use 6 joules of kinetic energy then we go down the hill and get that kinetic energy back. So we keep the total energy, but there is no friction. On earth there are 9.8 Newtons of gravity, and that gravity pulls things to the center of the earth, which will pull the cart down on the track. And when that happens there is friction and the rubbing of the atoms converts the kinetic energy to thermal energy, and we will not convert that back to kinetic energy. So we will need to increase the initial drop a lot, because we can't make it if we do not have enough speed or kinetic energy, Because there is a limited amount of energy in the roller-coaster.
