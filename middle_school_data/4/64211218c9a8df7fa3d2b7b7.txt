The best roller coaster design I could recommend to you goes as follows: the tallest possible hills that aren't taller or as tall as the initial drop and a tall initial drop. I recommend that because if the hills are taller than the initial drop, then the roller coaster car will not make it over the hill. For example, if the initial drop is 5 meters high, and the first hill is also 5 meters high, then the coaster car will not have enough total energy to make it over the hill. As the coaster car goes down the hill or the initial drop, it converts the potential energy(PE) that it had at the top of the hill into kinetic energy(KE), and all of the energy adds up to the total energy. The higher the initial drop, the more total energy there will be. The more energy there is, the faster and more exciting the ride will be, so I recommend a high initial drop and high hills. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only change forms. This means that the total energy of the car throughout the ride stays the same. Also, the more mass the coaster car has, the more energy the car will have.
