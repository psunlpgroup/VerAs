I think the design should be a tall drop with a shorter hill so you still have the power and energy to go down the hill.Lets say you want the most energy i would pick 5 it has the most energy to go down the hill and to get up and i would pick 3.5 for the hill its a good number in between 4 and 3 and heres why i would pick it.


If you think about it the hill if the height is 3.5 and the height of the drop height it would be and if you make the hill height and the drop the same it wont work.
