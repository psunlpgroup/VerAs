Dear Gonzalez family 
Here are my findings from our research on rollercoasters. First, we did the initial drop we learned that potential energy turned into kinetic energy. Then we studied hills and we learned if the hill is the same height or bigger than the initial drop the cart doesn't have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill. Then we did mass and energy we learned that the heavier carts had more energy than the lighter carts. But my takeaway on how to make the longest roller coaster is having a big first drop that has a lot of potential energy that can be turned into kinetic energy. So you can have a long fun and thrilling ride.
