The drop height of my rollercoaster will be 5 meters. This will give more Potential energy, and at the bottom, more Kinetic energy. This will make the car go further, and faster giving more  flexibility for the hill height.Speaking of hill height, I would say should be about 3 meters. This is a height that we can be sure the car will go through. this is because there will be enouch for the car to go past the hill no matter the friction. There will be enough kinetic energy for the car to go through the hill at this height.I would also reccoment more mass. Why? Well, the more mass, the more total energy for the car to use to accelerate. With this design, the car will start at the top with a lot of potential energy. When it starts to move, and go down the hill, the potential energy will be converted to kinetic energy. The car will then use this Kinetic energy to move up the hill. Then it will use the potential energy from going up the hill to go back down, and convert the potential energy to kinetic energy. The total energy will never change during this time. This is because the law of conservation of mas states that energy can't be created, or destroyed. It can become diferent energy like thermal energy, but it will never go away.
