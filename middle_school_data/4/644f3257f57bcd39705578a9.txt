My team has decided that the best formula would be drop height 5m so it has a fast head start then we did hill height 3m and car mass 50kg we decided to make our hill height 5m

 the height of my id is 5m when i started my test the pe was 2446 and when i got to the bottom ke 2438 so when we get to the top pe increased and ke decreased that's the same for the bottom ke increased pe decreased. 

You may wonder what changes in pe and ke when you go down the KE goes up and PE goes down ive seen this in every investgian Iâ€™ve done.i think this will make the ride safe and fun
