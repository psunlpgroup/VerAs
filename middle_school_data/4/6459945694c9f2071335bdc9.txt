Dear Gonzales family here are my recommendations for you to make the best roller coaster possible for your park.
First the roller coasters initial drop cannot be lower to the ground than the hill that is coming afterwards.
 In my simulation the cart that was on the initial drop that was lower than the hill afterwards didn't make it over the hill.
Second the higher the initial drop the better.
In my simulation when the drop height is higher the more PE the cart had, PE makes it more likely that more KE.
When PE goes up KE goes down when KE goes up PE goes down this relates to law of conservation of energy.

Law of conservation of energy
that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only transform from one form to another.

Third make the cart heavy.
In the simulation the greater the mass the greater the total energy,less mass the less the total energy.
   
So of you apply all of this to your roller coasters it will surely be fun and safe for everyone.
