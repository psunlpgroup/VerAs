Dear Gonzales Family,

My engineering company and I have come up with some initial ideas for measurements for the Initial Drop Height, Hill Height, and the Car Mass.  We feel that the ID Height should be 5m, hill height 2m, and the car mass 40kg.

First, for the ID (initial drop) height, I did 5m. I did this because I wanted it to be a steep hill so it would be fun and scary. I also chose to do the ID as 5m because it's higher than the hill which it should be.

Secondly, for the hill height, I did 2m. I did this because it will be a little hill to calm you down from the very high ID, but you will go very very fast. You will go very very fast on the hill because the ID is much higher than the hill so when the car goes down the ID it picks up speed so it goes very fast on the hill that's right after the ID.

Lastly, for the car mass, I did 40kg. I did this because it will go faster because it's lighter/has less mass. Also, that's another reason for why the car would go very fast on the hill after the ID.
