The first item is when the initial drop is taller, the car will have more potential energy at the top and more potential energy. I know this because when the initial drop was 5 meters high the PE was 1952J, but when the height was 2 meters the PE was 781J. This means the car will have more kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. For example, when the initial drop was 5 meters the KE was 1951J but when the height was 4 meters the KE was 1563J. The energy will shift throughout the drop from potential to kinetic. The energy transfers because of the Conservation of Energy, which states that energy can't be created or destroyed. So the ride will always have the same amount of total energy. This is shown in the initial drop data. When the height of the initial drop is 5 meters, the PE which is 1952J plus the KE of 0J is equal to the total energy of 1952J. Then at the bottom of the drop, the PE is 1J plus the KE of 1951J is equal to 1952J which is the same as the top of the drop. We also know the potential and kinetic energy equals the total energy. The drop height has to be taller than the hill height or else the car will not make it up the hill because potential energy depends on height. When we added a hill we tried a few different heights for the hill and ran test runs. Our initial drop height was 4 meters and when we tested 5 meters the car didn't make it over the hill. But when we tested a 2.5-meter hill the car made it over the hill. The larger the mass of the car, the more potential and kinetic energy there will be.
