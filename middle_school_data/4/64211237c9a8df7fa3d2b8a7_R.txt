One recommendation I would give the Gonzales family is to not have too high of a mass on the car. This is to ensure that the car is fast enough for it to be a fun ride. Another recommendation is to make the height of the hill shorter than the initial drop. This is because if the hill is taller than the initial drop it won't have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill. The reasoning behind this is that when the car goes down the initial drop, the potential energy in the car transforms into kinetic energy. Then the kinetic energy transforms back into potential energy when it goes up the hill. But if we don't have enough kinetic energy to turn into potential energy then the car won't make it up the hill. And you can never exceed the amount of potential energy at the top of the initial drop aka the total energy. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. "Energy can not be created nor destroyed" but adding to that the KE can transform into PE and reverse. The KE and PE in an object always add up to the total energy in that same object. If the amount of PE decreases, the KE will increase the same amount that the PE decreased and vice versa, both of them always adding up to the total energy. Also the higher up an object is from the ground, the more potential energy it will have. You can see this clearly by looking at my data, when I put the initial drop height as 3m the potential energy was 1,465J. And when I put my initial drop height as 4m the potential energy was 1,953J.
