When I was finished testing different heights, masses, friction, lengths, and energy. I have come to the conclusion that you should have the release height be 4.35m. When the height of the hill was 4.35m the potential energy of the drop started of as 2108. Then when the car hit the bottom of the hill the potential energy converted into kinetic energy. But in almost everyone of my tests there was at least 1 potential energy left, except the kinetic energy ended as 1659. My follow up of the conclusion is when the release height was higher than the hill, the cart was able to get over the hill. So the hill height needs to be lower than the initial drop, or the cart won't be able to get over the hill. Also the mass of the car plays a big role in how much energy a roller coaster has. So what I'm trying to say is the more mass the car has the less total energy there is. Lastly I have come to the conclusion that the inital drop should be 4.35m, the hill height should be 2m, and the mass of the car should be 45kg.
