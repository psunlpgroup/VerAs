Dear Gonzales family,

This is my idea for the roller coaster. First, for the initial drop, I want to make the drop 5 meters tall because that is how you get more TE because when the height increases the TE increases. For example, in my first trial, I made the height of the initial drop 2 meters and the TE was 977 joules but, on my last trial I made the height of the initial drop 5 meters, and the TE was 2443 joules. Second, for the hill, I decided to make the height 3 meters because 3 meters is the median causing the KE to constantly stay at a high amount of joules. But also the TE is high and the drop still gives adrenaline. For example, In my first trial, I made the hill 4 meters and the KE at the top of the hill was 482 joules and the TE was 2448. In my second trial, I made the hill 3 meters and the KE at the top of the hill was 973 joules and the TE was 2447 joules. In my final trial, I made the hill 2 meters tall and the KE at the top of the hill was 1464 joules and the TE was 2446 joules. Finally, for the mass of the car, I decided to make it 60 kg because that will produce the most TE causing the greatest amount of adrenaline. For example, in my first trial, I made the car mass 60 kg and the TE was 2936 in my final trial, I made the car 40 kg causing the TE to be 1957 which shows a direct relationship in the car's mass. In conclusion, I want the make the height of the initial drop 5 meters, the height of the hill 3 meters and the mass of the car 60 kg.

Thanks,
Matthew
