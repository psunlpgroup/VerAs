My drop height will be 5m because the higher the height, the more energy. When I tested the heights of the drop, the higher it was, the more energy the coaster had at the end. When the drop height was 5, the total energy was 5863. When the height was 2, the total energy was 2345. Potential and kinetic energy will be transferred between each other and thermal or sound energy as well. Going down the drop, PE and KE switch around, but the total energy stays the same. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that the amount of energy will stay the same, but will be transferred between different energies. Some PE and KE change into thermal and sound energy. If the hill height and the drop height are the same, the car won't be able to get to the end. If the drop height is higher than the hill height, the car will have enough energy to get to the end. When the hill height was 5, there was less energy in total than the rest.
