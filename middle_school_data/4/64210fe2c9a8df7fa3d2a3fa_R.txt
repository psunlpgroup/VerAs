The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. The potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its height above the zero position. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the potential energy was 1173 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 3 meters, the potential energy increased to 1759 Joules. Additionally, on my roller coaster design when the height of the drop was 2 meters, the potential energy was 1173 Joules. Kinetic energy was 0 Joules, but when the roller coaster went down the track potential and kinetic switched. The potential energy was 1 and the kinetic energy was 1172 Joules, so potential energy changed into kinetic energy. This is because potential energy changes into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy convert into potential energy, and then it repeats in a cycle. The total energy in a system is simply the sum of its internal, kinetic, and potential energies. The total energy was always the same as the PE, for example, the initial drop was 2 meters, PE was 1173 Joules, and the total energy was 1173 Joules. 3 meters, PE 1759 Joules, and total energy 1759 Joules. The Energy Transformation and Law of Conservation of Energy are 'energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be transformed from one form to another. This means that the initial drop with the hill can be at 4 meters, and the PE at the top of the drop is 2931 Joules. It means that it doesn't matter if it's KE or PE the total energy will always be the same. The relation between the initial drop and hill height is the cars gain energy when going down the drops.
