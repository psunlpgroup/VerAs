Are design for the roller coaster is the best its the most fun and it can go the whole time without stopping are coaster weights 60 KG which helps it gain speed during the ride. when you first start the ride you have 2932 J of potential energy then the coaster goes up the 60 meter hill. when going down it you will have gained 2932 J of kinetic energy it will be able to go through the loop de loop. gaining even more kinetic energy that helps it go up the  final 60 meter hill and going down will gain kinetic energy. again to make it through the last loop de loops and finish the ride. as you are going up and down the hills your PE and KE will switch its energy because the potential energy will be the fastest you could go. the energy will switch to kinetic as you go down the hills gaining speed and turns from potential energy to kinetic energy. the hills and mass of the coaster helps it gain kinetic energy the hill is 60 meters which means you have more time to gain speed. the weight of the coaster is 60 KG which will make the coaster fall faster having it gain more speed. this ride is fun, exiting and its fast and thats why you should pick our coaster.
