Hello I have some recommendations for you the first one is make your initial drop higher than your hill because the higher the initial you drop is the higher your potential energy is and you want potential energy to make your roller coaster finish. My best design so far has 2.60 Hill height, 2137 PE top of initial drop, 0 KE top of initial drop, 1279 PE Top of hill, 857 KE Top of hill and 2137 Total Energy. I made the Initial drop high because Initial drop and PE have a direct relationship. Total energy is the total amount of energy that remains constant. And just to let you know mass and energy have a direct relationship so as mass increases so does PE and It's true for Kinetic energy, KE has a direct relationship with mass. The same is true of velocity. And there is something called Energy transformation and Law of Conservation of Energy and it talks about how energy can't be created and destroyed.
