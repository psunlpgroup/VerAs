My recommendation is to have the roller coaster weigh 60kg and for the initial drop to be 5m. The ride will start at the top of the hill, where the coaster has the most potential energy.  Since more height is more potential energy. As the coaster goes down the hill, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion. The coaster gains speed and momentum, and as it approaches the bottom of the hill, it reaches its maximum kinetic energy. As the coaster begins to slow down, it climbs the next hill, and the potential energy increases. This process continues as the coaster goes through the various hills, drops, and loops of the ride. Total energy will not change throughout the ride in a friction less world. Although if there is friction the total energy will transfer into thermal energy throughout the ride.  Energy cannot be created or destroyed so the energy can't just disappear rather it converts into a different energy. The relation between the initial drop height and hill height in the roller coaster is determined by the speed of the roller coaster and the laws of physics.
