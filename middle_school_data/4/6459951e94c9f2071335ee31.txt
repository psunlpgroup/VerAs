 Hello Gonzales family! I'm mailing you my essay about how my roller coaster would be the most popular attraction and how it would run flawlessly without any problems with it's design. 

 First it has a fast initial drop down into a tunnel then in slowly climes a hill, gaining 2937 PE to make it over a giant hill. Once it drops converting it all into 2933 KE and allowing it to make it over the hill and into a drop. With a inversion and then slowing down into a flat area keeping the total energy the same because all the PE turned into KE when it went down the initial drop. 
 The cart will be 60Kg because through out my research that's the weigt that gave me the most PE(2937) and KE(2933) energy in all my simulations. 
 And the reason why the initial drop is so much bigger than the hill is because the initial has to have more PE than the hill at the top of it so it can make it over the hill. The flat area also shows that the total energy is just the PE + the KE energy 
 And that Gonzales family is why I know my roller coaster will out preform and work better than any other roller coaster you might see.
