When making roller coasters, It needs to be fun and exciting while still making it to the end of the ride. 

The relationship between PE and KE is, when PE goes down, KE goes up, and this creates the total energy.

Initial drop is important while making a roller coaster. For example when the release height was at 5.00 meters, the potential energy had 2443 Jules. And when the release height was at 2.50 meters, the potential energy had 1222 Jules. The higher the potential energy, the higher number of Jules for kinetic energy, which is needed to make it to the end of the ride. 

When making the roller coaster, hills play a big roll too. In order for the coaster to make it to the end, the hill height must be shorter than the initial drop or else it wont make it to the end of the ride. For example when my hill height was at 5.00 meters with my initial drop at 2.50 meters, the coaster wasn't able to make it up the hill because there wasn't enough potential energy. Then when the hill height was at 2.00 meters the coaster was able to make it up the hill and to the end of the ride because the initial drop was higher up than the hill and had more potential energy. 

The mass of the coaster is important too. When the car mass was at 40kg with an itial drop height of 5.00 meters, the PE had a sum of 1955J. When the car mass was at 60kg with an initial drop height of 5.00 meters, the PE had a sum of 2933J which was more likely to go up the hill and make it to the end of the coaster. 

These are things you need to look for if you want a roller coaster design that will be exciting and make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
