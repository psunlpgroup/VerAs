The Gonzales family needs the initial drop high so the car can go through the roller coaster. I know this because the data shows that the higher the drop, the higher the potential energy. In the first trial, I did the release height of 2m and had a potential energy of 976 joules. In the second trial I did I put a height of 3m and then I had a potential energy of 2450 joules. So that shows that the higher the drop the more potential energy.
The Gonzales family needs to know that PE and KE added together at the start will equal the total energy at the bottom. PE and KE change throughout the roller coaster, so at the top, there will be 0 kinetic and 100 potential. As the cart goes down those numbers gradually switch as the car goes down. The conservation of energy says that energy can't be created or destroyed but distributed from different kinds of energy. In the data, the KE at the end will not be the same as the PE at the start but there might be some leftovers and some could have been turned into thermal. 

Relationship between drop height and hill height, the data shows us that if the hill is shorter than the initial drop, the car will go over. As we noticed, though, as soon as we got to the same hill height as the drop, the car would not go over and keep rocking back and forth. As shown in some of our trials we have a hill height of 2m and the car made it over at the drop height of 4m.As soon as we had a hill height of 4m and a drop height of 4m then the car did not make it.

The relationship between mass and energy is the more mass an object has the more potential and kinetic energy an object has.
