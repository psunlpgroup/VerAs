the drop height of my roller costar design is 5 meters because the bigger the drop the more pe. For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters the pe was 1564 j but when I increased the initial drop to 5 meters the pe was 1955. so that means it has more energy to go through the coster with because pe turns into ke and ke is the energy of motion. As long as the next obstacle is shorter than the initial drop it will make it over. I think the mass should be 40 because it's lighter. but it doesn't matter that much because as long as the next obstacle is shorter it will make it.
