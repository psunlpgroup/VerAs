          The Gonzales family is wanting a roller coaster with the most excitement. I would tell them that they would need a coaster with the biggest initial drop, a big first hill, and the biggest coaster car. These conditions would give them the most "exciting" car.
          To start, potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE) work off of each other. They share the total energy (TE) and the TE just switches and changes between KE and PE. So working with that, in order to start with the most PE, the initial drop needs to be as high as possible to generate the most PE and TE. In this case, 5 M is as high as possible. 
          We know that drop height is related to TE and PE because when the initial drop height was 3 m, the PE was 1466 J. And when it was 5 m, PE was 2443 J. So, higher drop height = more potential energy. At the top of the hill, KE is always 0, because it is stationary. At the bottom of the hill, the KE will be the total PE, minus energy put into mechanical energy.
          The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can change forms. That is what is happening when PE turns into KE. And when there is less KE than PE that you started with, energy turned into mechanical energy. That is when energy turns into sound, friction, heat, etc. 
          Moving on, for the hill height, bigger is better. But, you cannot have your hill be higher than your initial drop, because that would require more energy than you have. But, you can still have a close number. My hill trial with a height of 4.05 m still generated 2448 J of TE.
