Rollercoaster Essay #1

Dear, Gonzales family 
  
My company has a fun and exciting fast roller coaster for you, we made it with nice big drops and loops, and we made the ID height 5.00m because we thought it would be a fun part to start the roller coaster. We made the hill height 4.12m, it's a little smaller than the ID because if the hill height was bigger than the ID you would not make it to the end of the roller coaster.
 We made the car mass 50kg. We have the PE at the top of the hill the same as the KE at the bottom of the hill, as the car goes down the hill it's transferring between the two. The taller the hill the more PE which means more KE at the bottom of the hill And those two equal the total energy.
 As the cart moves its way down the hill we know that the PE is the most at the top of the hill and KE is the most at the bottom of the hill so when the cart moves down the hill the PE and KE are transporting through each other but they both are equal. When there's more KE at the bottom and more PE at the top that is where we get some of our energy when there's more KE and PE at the top and bottom. As we know the hill height can not be taller than the ID because if it is you will not make it to the end of the ride and will be stuck in the middle of the ride.
