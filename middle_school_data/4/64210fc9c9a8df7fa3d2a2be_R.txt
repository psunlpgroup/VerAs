For our initial drop I was thinking 5 meters. If we want the roller coaster to be fun and safe a higher drop would be fun but it would also be safe. We were thinking we could put the loop right after the initial drop so it doesn't lose any momentum and it would be able to make it around the loop. After you go around the loop we could put in an invert going into the hill. For the hill we were thinking 3 meters so it's high but not too high so it will stop in time for the ride to end.
