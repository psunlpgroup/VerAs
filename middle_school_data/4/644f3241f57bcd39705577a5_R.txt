Dear Gonsales Family
My company designed a fun and safe roller coaster we hope that this will make your amusement park fun and entertaining and yes we know that it is ready and here is some proof that it is ready.
 The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4.50 meters. 
This is because it is fun, safe, and has enough energy to the end. For example, when I tested the drop height of 4.50 meters, the PE was 1893. 
When I increased the drop height to 4.50 meters, the PE increased Joules like Trail 1 3.19 when you increased the PE at the initial drop it is now 1557. Trail 2 4.39, when it increased the PE at the initial drop, is now 21.46. Trail 3 2 when it increased the PE at the initial drop is now 977. 
I notice the relationship between PE and KE is when KE goes down the PE goes up. When we add PE and KE it made TE ( total energy) TE is how much PE and KE are made together like for an ex m+g+h would make the TE.
When we are looking at are data we notice that energy can not be created or destroyed but it can conversion one type of energy to another.
