This letter is for the roller coaster. The data I have found on the roller coaster. It will be shown as it varies by energy, initial drop height, hill height, and car mass this is all made to emphasize excitement and safety.

                                                                               Initial Drop.

I would recommend making a 5.00 meter initial drop. This would be beneficial to the roller coaster as it had the most amount of Joules (energy) while still being safe as this would be popular as the drop would be really exciting to the fan base. 

                                                                               Hill height.

Then I would recommend making a 4.50 meter hill as you cant make it the same height or a higher height than the initial drop height as the total energy would go from all PE at the top of the drop to being almost all KE at the bottom of the hill. And there wouldn't be enough energy to get over the hill this would be best as it charges up for another drop but is safe and can make it over the hill while still producing 2449 Joules (energy). This can happen as the law of conservation of energy is that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. 

                                                                                  Car Mass.

The best car mass would be 60 kg as it produces the most Joules as when there is more weight on the car the faster it goes producing more excitement while being safe.

                                                                                 Conclusion.

All of this shows why you should go with a roller coaster that has a 5.00 meter initial drop 4.50 meter hill and make the car mass 60 kilograms.
