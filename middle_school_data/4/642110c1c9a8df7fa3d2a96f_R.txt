dear gonzales family i created a new rolar cost for you because i am a good boy. the higher we make the inital drop the higher the hill following the inital drop can be as long as it is shorter than the drop. the more kenetic energy there is the more kenetic energy there will be and we could make the rolar costar go faster. the total energy at the end of the rolar coster could be higher if the hight was raised. no matter what when the car reashes the top of the first hill the kenetic energy will drop and the potental enrygy will increase and make it so that the cart can make it over another hill. in order for the car to make it over the hill the inital drop needs to be higher the the hill hight, the more the cart wieghs the more energy the cart will have as it goes down the hill.
