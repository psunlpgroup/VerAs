The height of our initial drop will be 5 meters off the ground so the total energy will be high enough to power the coaster through. Also, the kinetic energy will increase as it goes down the drop giving it enough time to come back up. In our design we want a high total energy to power our roller coaster. The potential and kinetic energy will be high making the ride fun for our guests. At the tops of the hills, the potential energy will be higher than our kinetic energy. While going down the hill the kinetic energy will start to catch up and eventually at the end will be higher than the potential energy. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy shall be created or destroyed, so our total energy will remain the same even if the potential, thermal and kinetic energy fluctuates. The hills must be shorter than the drop so the coaster has enough kinetic energy to push it up the hill. Mass affects kinetic and potential energy a lot because even just a small change in mass can affect the outcome of the ride, we learned this in our many trials. Both kinetic and potential energy have this relationship with mass because mass is a part of both of their mathematical equations.
