Dear the Gonzales family, my design is a great choice for the roller coaster that you are building. You will love my roller coaster design because it is safe, speedy, and most importantly fun!!

My design is very well constructed. My roller coaster first goes up, and has the initial drop, after that comes the best part- the loop. Following that there is a small hill that goes down into a flat part, then it's done!!! 

I learned when I was testing different roller coasters that the heavier the car the better. 


The KE at the bottom are all one less than the  PE at the top. Also the total energy is the same as PE at the top of the hill. For example 977 is the PE, and 977 is the total energy.

Overall you should choose my roller coaster!!
