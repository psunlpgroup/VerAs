I would recommend to not make the first loop or hill taller than the initial drop. Because if you make the first hill or first loop taller than the initial drop then the roller coaster will roll back down the hill or loop and it will not make it over. If the hill or loop is smaller though, then it will make it over the hill or loop. 

When the car is at the top of the initial drop then it has the most PE it will ever have. But if the car is halfway, then the KE and PE are about the same because of the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. 

If the car is lighter the easier it is going to be to get it to go up the hill or loop. Because it is lighter so it will not slow down as easy as the heavier one will. As the Initial drop height goes up, the more PE it will have. For instance at initial drop height: 2 the PE is 977, but at 3 it is 1466. And as it goes up the more PE it will have.

 The relationship between kinetic and potential relationships are direct because they change equally as the car goes down the hill. When the car is about 1/4 down the hill the potential energy will exchange 1/4 to kinetic energy and it will keep doing this as the car goes down the hill. So at the end kinetic energy will have all 4/4 of the energy. But as it goes up the hill it repeats that process but at the top potential energy will have all 4/4 of the energy. 

The total energy is determined by KE and PE when they are at their maximum energy. So when the potential energy is at its fullest and when the kinetic energy is at its fullest that is total energy. 

The mass of the car depends on how much energy is put into the track. If there is a lot of mass in the car then the car will go faster because it is heavier. That will effect the energy of the car so it will crash into the end. So we need the just right mass for the car so it can slow down in time to not crash into the end.
