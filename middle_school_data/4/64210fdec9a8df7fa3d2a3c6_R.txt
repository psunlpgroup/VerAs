The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because when the drop height is higher the total energy is higher. For example, when i tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 0 joules. when i increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased at 1 joule. The PE should be higher than the KE so the car makes it to the end of the ride. When one form of energy is transformed to another no energy is destroyed in the process.  The hill height of my roller coaster is 2 meters. This is because when the hill height was lower the car made it to the end but when the hill height was higher the car didn't make it to the end. For example, when i tested the hill height of 2 the PE at the top of the hill was 964. When i increased the hill height to 4 the PE at the top of the hill increased at 1734 joules. The car mass for my roller coaster design is 60kg. This is because when the mass is higher the total energy is higher. For example, when i tested the car mass at 40kg, the PE was only 1578 joules. When i increased the mass to 60kg the PE increased at 2368 joules. So that is why it is better to have a higher drop height and car mass but it is better to have a lower hill height so your car makes it to the end.
