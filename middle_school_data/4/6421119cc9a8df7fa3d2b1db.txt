      I would most likely talk to the Gonzales family about how the higher the release height they start with, the more initial potential energy they will have. For example, if the roller coaster release height is 2 meters, the potential energy will be 977 Joules. If the release height is 5, the potential energy will be 2443 and the kinetic energy will be the same as the initial potential energy at the bottom of the drop. All of this added up will create the total energy and make the ride faster.

     When the car moves down the hill, the energy in the potential energy converts to the energy of kinetic energy, this relates to the Law of Conservation of Energy which is when the energy has a consistent change. My initial drop would have to be higher than the hill for it to successfully make it over the hill. For example, when my initial drop height is 3.5 and my hill height is 2 it would completely make it over the hill. When my initial drop height is 3.5 and my hill height is 5 it will not completely make it over the hill.
