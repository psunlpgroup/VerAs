       I will be talking about the most fun and safe roller coaster design for the Gonzales family. the roller coaster will have a 5m ID and a car that weighs 60kg. It will also have a 4.75m hill directly after the initial drop.
       The total energy is the sum of the Kinetic and potential energy. The sum of Kinetic and potential energy will always equal the total no matter what due to the law of conservation. The law of conservation states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
       The science behind the roller coaster is that the 5m drop will give it a lot of energy to go up and over the hill. This is due to the force known as gravity, and adding a 60kg car while the 40 kg car had a total of 1959J of energy. so a 60 kg car will make it drop faster thus making the ride more fun. The data shows this because the initial drop data, states that a 2m ID only has 977J of total energy while the 5m drop has 2443J of total energy. Then for the data of mass and energy, a 60kg car on a 5m drop has 2938.
       The 4.75m hill is important to the ride because it's fun to go up hills. The way how the car is able to make it up the hill without a boost is because the hill is shorter than the initial drop. This is shown by adding hills when the initial drop is 5m while the hill height was also 5m. The car was not successful in making it up and over the hill. That is why the hill is 4.75m tall being just under 5m making sure the cart is able to make it over.
       all these reasons show why my roller coaster is the most fun and safe design.
