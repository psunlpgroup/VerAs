A recommendation that I have for the Gonzales family is that the hill height must be smaller than the initial drop because otherwise the car won't make it over the hill and make it to the end of the ride. In one of my experiments, when the hill height was at 4.00 and the initial drop was at 4.00 the car didn't make it over the hill and got stuck at the bottom between the hill and initial drop. Also making the mass bigger will increase the amount of potential and kinetic energy in the ride. When I put the car mass 40 kg, the potential energy was at 1953 at the top of the initial drop and at the bottom of the drop the kinetic energy was at 1953. But when you put the car mass up to 60 kg, the potential energy was at 2930 at the top of the initial drop and at the bottom of the drop it was at 2930 kinetic energy. The potential energy will always add up to equal the  kinetic energy at the top and bottom of the initial drop, unless friction was added. But the total energy will always depend on the potential and kinetic energy. The bigger the height of the drop will also make it so that their will be more potential energy at the top of the initial drop and more kinetic energy at the bottom. At the top of the hill the higher up it is will mean that their will be more potential energy stored up in that car. The more potential energy stored up will make it have more kinetic energy while going down the initial drop into the start of the hill. When the potential energy is stored up at the top of the drop the car starts slowly going down the initial drop. The potential energy will gradually start to turn into kinetic energy and at the end of the initial drop the energy will almost always be fully transferred to the kinetic energy from the potential energy. Lastly, having the initial drop higher than the hill height is the best idea for the riders enjoyment and safety so that the car won't get stuck between the initial drop and the hill.
