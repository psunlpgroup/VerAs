When the cart is at the top of the roller coaster the PE (potential energy) will be equal to the TE (total energy), and the KE (kinetic energy) will be at 0 because the cart is not in motion. While the cart is moving the PE & KE will change but in this frictionless sim, the PE and KE will always add up to the TE at the start and end.
       When I tested the drop height in 3 meters the PE was 1466 joules. When I increased the drop height to 4 meters the PE also increased to 1955 joules. When I decreased the drop height to 2 meters the PE again, decreased to 977 joules. What I've gathered is the higher the drop the more PE.
