              The most important recommendations I have for the Gonzales family is that the larger the mass of the cart the farther the cart will go. Also the first drop must be taller than the second drop or loop so that the coaster car gets to the end. During my research of the coaster car I found that even if the cart is equal with the second drop or loop it will still not get over, but when beyond it gets over the hill easily. So having a high initial drop is key to having a fun yet safe ride. Another point is to not have too much friction on the track rails, because this can dramatically slow down a roller coaster car. The slower the roller coaster the less people will want to ride it meaning lower ticket sales.
