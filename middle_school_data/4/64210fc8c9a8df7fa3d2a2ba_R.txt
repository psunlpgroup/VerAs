The drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters this is because the higher the drop is the more PE. For example, if the drop height is 5 meters the PE is 2932 but if the drop is 2 meters 1173 that's why there will be more excitement the roller coaster will be more for the passengers. and for us the designers to make it and the higher the drop the more total energy there will be. Also the more KE there will be throughout the ride. and the relationship between KE and PE. Is that when the cart is at the top of the drop there will be only PE because the cart is not moving. and most of an even split between PE and KE is when the cart is going down the hill. and in a frictionless world, they would just transfer back and forth from each other throughout the coaster. And when you are going down the drop the PE will all change into KE because the less height you have the less PE there will be. Also as we know because of the law of conservation of energy, "Energy can not be created or destroyed". So we know that the energy will have to change from one source to another when the coaster is going down the drop the PE will change into KE because the cart is moving. and then when you have to add a hill you have to make the hill shorter than the drop. because you need to have enough energy to make it. over the hill and not go backward the more mass there is on the roller coaster cart the more PE and KE there will be no matter the drop height if the drop height is 5 meters. and the cart mass is 60 Kg the PE will be, 2931 J of PE at the top but if you have a cart that is 40 Kg, then the PE will be. 1955 J.
