Dear the Gonzales family my design is a great choice for the roller coaster that you are building. You will love my roller coaster design because it is safe, speedy, and most importantly fun!! My roller coaster first goes up, and has the initial drop, after that comes the best part- the loop. Following after that there is a small hill that goes down into a flat part, then its done!!! The initial drop has to be higher than the hill you place after it. The car for the coaster should be heavy, and the energy at the top of the initial drop should be high. The car for the roller coaster we are creating should be heavy. I learned when I was testing different roller coasters that the heavier the car was the more potential energy it had at the top of the hill. when the drop is high, the potential energy is high, which means when it goes down the hill, it will convert into kinetic energy and make it go faster. Overall my design is very great, and you should chose it!!
