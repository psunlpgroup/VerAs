The Drop height of the roller coaster design is 4.5 meters. This relates to the potential energy and kinetic energy. Because the potential energy formula is PE = mass x gravity x height which means. At the top of the initial drop the PE is 2200 J and at the bottom it is 0 J. Same with KE but revised, the formula for KE is, KE= Â½ Mass x Velocity x 2 so the KE at the bottom is 2200 J and 0 J at the top. So that is why the drop relates to PE and KE.

The PE and KE relate to each other. Because if the height of the ID was 3 Meters. Then the PE on the top of the ID will be 1466 J and KE will be 0 J. But when the cart goes down the hill the PE and KE switch. So at the bottom, the KE is 1466 J and PE is 0 J. showing that the PE and KE relate to each other.

The TE is made up of PE and KE. Because at the top of the ID whatever the PE is at the top, the TE is the same number. When the cart is going down the ID wherever the cart is the PE and KE always adds up to the TE. And at the bottom of the ID, the KE always has the same number as the TE. Showing that the TE is always made up of PE and KE.

The ID always has to be higher than the HH. Because if the ID was lower than the HH, the PE on the top of the ID will be too little to go over the HH and reach to end. But when the ID is bigger than the HH, the PE will be great enough to go over the HH. Showing the energy transformation and law of Conservation of Energy.

The mass and energy relate to each other. Because the mass of the cart affects it goes down the ID and up the HH. Also the PE, KE, and the TE. Showing that the mass and energy relate to each other.

If the HH is bigger than the ID then with the PE it would not make it to the end. Because if the ID was 3.5 meters and the HH was 4 meters it would not make it. But if the ID was 4 meters and the HH was 3.5 meters it would make it. Proving that if the HH is bigger than the ID it would not make it to the other side.
