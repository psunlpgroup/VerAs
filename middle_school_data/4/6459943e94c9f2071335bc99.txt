We will discuss how the roller coaster will be built and what it should look like. The rollercoaster should have a high initial drop point for the best results. Looking at the data we know that when the initial drop point is at its highest (5m) it has the most potential energy. Making it a) more fun and b) Will have more Potential energy and Kinetic energy. With more PE and KE the ride will have more potential to be longer or faster and will make sure it gets through the whole track.  Looking at the add a Hill data the hill should be high. (So that there is more PE and KE ) but it should not be as tall or taller than the initial drop height, otherwise, the cart will not have enough energy to go all the way up and over the hill. Also looking at the mass of the cart and depending on how heavy it is, can make the ride have more energy. Looking at the data from Mass & Energy it shows that the more mass something has when it's going down a hill the more energy it will have in total.   Looking at all this evidence and data my roller coaster will be the most fun safe and amazing rider ever.
