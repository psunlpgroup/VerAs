Dear Gonzales family 

I have an idea to make a safe and fun roller coaster I have to set the ID height, Hill height, and the car mass, we need to find out if the car can make it to the end if we add friction. The ID is 5 and the hill height is 3 and the car mass is 55, if the friction is 0.03 It doesn't make it because it doesn't have enough energy to make it If the friction is 0.02 it still wont make it if it is 0.01 it will make because there is not too much friction on the cart. When the PE decreases  the KE increases but the TE stays the same. As the car mass increases the PE increases but the KE stays at 0 but when the cart goes down the ID the PE decreases and the KE increases but the TE is the same as the PE. When the cart is on top of the hill the PE increases again.
