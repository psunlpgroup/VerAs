Here is my design for the new roller coaster at the Gonzales family amusement park. I suggest the height of the initial drop be 4 meters. During my experiment when the height of the initial drop was high, the PE was also high. The PE at the top of the ride will be the TO of the entire ride. When you get to the bottom of the initial drop the PE will turn into KE. The KE at the top of the ride will be 0, At the bottom, it will be equal to the TO. But for the PE at the top of the ride, it will be equal to the TO, and at the bottom, it will be 0. As you go through the ride when you go up something the KE will go down and the PE will go up. For example during the initial drop at the top, the PE is at its greatest, as it goes down the ride it will turn into KE gradually, and at the bottom, the PE will have fully turned to KE. The reason why it changes is that the law of conservation of energy, states that "energy can not be created or destroyed" and the TO will also stay consistent. After the drop, I would like to put a loop in the coaster I would like to put the loop before the hill. I would like the loop to be 2.5 meters. The reason why I would like the loop to be smaller than the initial drop is because otherwise, it would not go over. I found this out when I was doing my experiments when the loop height is higher than the initial drop it will not make it over because the KE from the initial drop is not enough to carry over into it. The same thing to the hill if it is higher than the initial drop and the loop the KE will not be enough to carry over into the hill. The next thing I want is the cart to be 55 kg, I would like it to be heavy but not insanely heavy. During my experiment, I found out that if the cart weight was heavier then it would have more PE. Then since the PE transfers over to KE the KE would be higher too. So when the mass is higher the more PE it will have, and KE.
