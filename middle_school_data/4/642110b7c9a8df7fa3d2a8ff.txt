Hello, Gonzales family here are my recommendations for your roller coaster design. First, I believe you should have it be at 5 meters for the initial drop height. This is because the higher the drop height the more potential energy you will have at the top and the more kinetic energy you say at the bottom. For the hill height, I believe it should be 4 meters. I recommend this so then your car will for sure make it over the hill from the initial drop of 5 meters.The mass of the car should be 50. It's right in the middle of the two options.
