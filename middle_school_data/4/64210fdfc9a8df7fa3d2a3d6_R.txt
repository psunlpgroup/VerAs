The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because we want more energy and for it to make it over the hills and around the loops. The more height you have the more energy. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1173 joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased and was 1995 joules. The relationship between KE and PE and total energy is that in a fiction-less world, the PE and the top of the initial drop is the total energy, and KE and PE switch off. For example, when the drop height was 3 the PE was 1173 joules and the total energy was also 1173 joules. When the cart goes down the drop KE and PE swap. For example, if the cart is exactly halfway down the hill and the PE was 100 joules and Ke was 0 joules at the top. Then the KE and PE would both be 50 joules There would always be the same amount of PE and total energy in a frictionless world because energy can not be created or destroyed. If the drop height is 5 meters the hill height would have to be smaller than 5 meters. The more mass you have the more KE and PE you have and more total energy.
