i would make the top of the start taller  then the hill because theirs more energy going up the hill .and less gravity pulling it down and with more energy the more speed and better movement .kinetic energy should be the same as the end as the begin of the potential energy . the potential energy begins at the start because it hasn't been used yet kinetic is at the end  . because its been used mass can effect both energy because it can effect how high or fast the cart can go. initial drop height and hill height effect each other because initial  drop height can make the cart go higher on the hill the height affects kinetic and potential energy because the height of the start can affect how high the cart will go higher or lower potential energy is higher at the start because it is stored and ready to be used and kinetic energy goes higher because the cart is in action moving total energy will not change at all because one will kinetic or potential will always equal the total energy potential at the start will be the same as kinetic at the end  mass and kill height and the initial drop is important because depending on how high the initial drop is the cart will go higher because it has more speed going up the hill the begin and the end will be the same because potential transforms  into kinetic because the stored energy is being released into kinetic it can only change during the cycle because one could add up while one stays the same
