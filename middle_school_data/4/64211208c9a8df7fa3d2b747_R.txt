To the Gonzales family these are my recommendations to make the best roller coaster for your amusement park. Let's start with the initial drop, I would recommend making your initial drop 5 meters high so the cart starts off with enough potential energy to get threw the whole ride. The conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed but can be  turned into a different energy. like potential energy and kinetic energy. Our data showed that the higher the cart is the more potential energy it starts off with. and the more kinetic energy and total energy the cart ends with making the roller coaster faster and it would be able to make it threw the entire ride. The total energy will always be the same as potential energy. Now lets talk about the hill, The hill has to be lower than the initial drop or else the cart will not start with enough potential energy to make it over the hill. Now what should the weight of the car be? Our data showed that the higher the mass of the car the more potential kinetic and total energy the car had meaning more speed. I would recommend making the mass of the car 60 kg because that's what our data showed was the best option. Those are my recommendations for the roller coaster.
