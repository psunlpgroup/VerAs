My best roller coaster design so far has an initial drop of 5m, a hill of 3m, and a car weight of 60kg. I have chosen these sizes because KE and initial drop height have a direct relationship I know this because in our simulation when we raised the initial drop height the KE went up. For example, my data shows when my drop height was 2m there was a KE of 977j. But when I raised the initial drop height to 5m it had 2443j of KE which is more than double the speed. I chose a hill height of 3m because it is still pretty big but the cart will make it over without ever slowing down too much. I know this because my data shows when the drop height is 3m if the hill is not below 3m it will not make it over. I chose to have a cart weight of 60kg because the weight and KE and PE have a direct relationship so the heavier the car the faster it will go my data proves that the heavier the cart is the more energy there is. When my car mass was 40kg it had a KE of 977J but when I raised the mass to 60kg it had 1466J of KE. The total energy will stay the same throughout the whole ride because energy can't be created or destroyed.
