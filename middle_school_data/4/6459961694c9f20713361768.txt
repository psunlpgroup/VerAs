The Law of Conservation of Energy states that Energy can neither be created nor destroyed but it can be transformed from one form of Energy to another. Potential Energy changes to Kinetic energy during a ride. This demonstrates the Law of Conservation Energy and proves it to be correct. The higher the hill height in a ride, the greater the initial drop of the roller coaster. For instance, when analyzing hills, my group and I noticed a pattern. On our #2 trial of analyzing hills, we experimented with a hill height of 3.37 (m) and this hill height increased the total PE of the initial drop making it our highest recorded. This number was 1642 (J). The hill height of a ride can also affect the initial drop height negatively. For instance, on trial #4, my group tested a hill with a height of 2 (m). These two meters created an initial drop height of 1640 making have less energy and the least exciting. By experimenting further, we are able to determine the amount of PE and KE a roller coaster has by looking at the mass. The larger the mass a car has in a coaster, the larger the PE at the top of the initial drop and the larger the KE at the bottom of the drop. After conducting many experiments, we found a car with a mass of 60 (kg) had 2937 (J) of PE and 2930 (J) of KE. But, a car with a mass of 40 (kg) only had 1258  (J) of PE and 1953 (J) of KE at the bottom of the drop. These pieces of evidence show that the amount of mass a ride has dictates the amount of PE and KE a ride has.
