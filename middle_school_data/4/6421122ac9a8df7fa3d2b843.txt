After running many trials with diverse variables, we have some suggestions to make the best roller coaster design. First, the height of the initial drop should be the highest option available. The kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial will be equal to, or less than the potential energy at the top of the hill. It is necessary to have as much kinetic energy as possible to keep the roller coaster moving. The higher an object is, the more potential energy it will have, along with the more kinetic energy it will have at the bottom. The total amount of energy will never grow, it can only be lost by friction. This energy doesn't get lost, it goes to thermal energy. Thermal energy is not a part of the total energy once it has been transferred. As stated in the Law of Conservation of Energy, "Energy cannot be destroyed or created, but it can be transferred". On the roller coaster there will be friction, meaning a bit of the energy will be transferred into thermal energy. 

The total energy at the bottom of the initial drop will be less than the total energy at the top of the initial drop. This means that the hill must have less height than the initial drop. If the hill is more than or equal to the height of the initial drop the roller coaster will not make it all the way. This is because the coaster needs more total energy at the top of the hill than what it started with, which is not possible. In one trial the height of the hill was .01 meter greater than the initial drop, and the car did not have enough energy to make it over. Finally, it is recommended that the mass of the car is the lowest possible. The more mass the car has, the more friction will occur, causing more energy to be transferred.
