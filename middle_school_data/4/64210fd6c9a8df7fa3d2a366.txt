The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because when you have a high drop height it means that the rest of your roller coaster could be longer because there will be more energy so that you can have a longer track. For example, when I tested the drop height to 2 meters there was only a PE of 977 joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters there was 2443 joules, the PE increased by 1466 joules. When the coaster goes down the hill it will lose almost all of it PE, so the next hill or loop that you decide to make would have to have a slightly smaller height. Other wise it won't make it with the amount of KE it has left. Another thing that would have to be thought about is the weight, because with it being too heavy would mean that it might not make it up the next hill. One thing that I recommend is having a 47-53 kg car so it will have enough weight but not too much.

Also I had done all of my testing with 0 friction, so I know that most of this info would not actually work with friction but with no friction this info is correct.
