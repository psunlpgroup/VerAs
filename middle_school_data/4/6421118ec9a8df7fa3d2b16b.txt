The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This made the PE at the top 2932 joules and the KE at the bottom 2930, but if i make the drop height shorter the joules will lower. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 1173 joules. The PE occurs at the top of the initial drop and hill, right before its about to go down. And the PE turns into the KE when its going down the hill it changes energy. The starting drop height has to be higher than the hill height or else the cart on the roller coaster won't make it to the end because there wont be anymore energy. The more mass, the more energy.
