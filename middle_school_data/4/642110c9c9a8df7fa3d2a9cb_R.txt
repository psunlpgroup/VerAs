Dear Gonzalez Family,
The best roller coaster design so far with the most excitement and that is physically possible is a hill with a drop of 4 meters a 52 kg cart and a 3 meter hill. 
This works because the initial drop is higher then the hill so it is physically possible to make it to the end of the drop. Because of the heavier cart it generates the most kinetic energy which creates a lot of excitement. Because of the amount of kinetic energy and the height of the hill the kinetic energy smoothly makes it over the hill while generating the most kinetic energy. 
We ran some experiments the first one of which the independent variable was the height. The roller coaster and the results followed- 4 meters: 1955 J, 3 meters: 977 J, 2 meters: 976. We concluded that 4 meters was the best initial drop height because it generates the most kinetic energy which will give the ride thrilling start.
The experiments we ran on the cart weight show how it affects the kinetic energy whilst still keeping the height and hill height the same. We measured the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. The results followed- 52 kg: 2035 J, 48 kg: 1878 J, 44 kg: 1722 J. We concluded that to increase potential kinetic energy to use a 52 kg cart.
Lastly the experiments we ran for the height of the hill show how it effects the kinetic energy. The differences between the hill height were very minor. The results follow- 2 meters: 1956, 3 meters: 1958, 4 meters: 1956.
The Law of conservation of energy applies in this scenario because it states that mass can neither be created or destroyed so the energy of the cart cannot either the energy is just transferred. 
So combining all the results of trials we believe that we picked the pest combination that gives the roller coaster a total of 2034 J of kinetic energy. This ride is very thought out and has tones of energy and excitement!
