Dear Gonzales family, 
We have decided our ID height will be 5j, our hill height will be 3j and our car mass will be 50 kg. I picked these numbers because when I tested the drop height of 4j the PE was 2190. When I  increased the drop height, the PE increased to 2738j with 5 height.  If the height is 5 the cart will go faster so the energy goes faster making it fun and safe and you'll make it all the way. The law of conservation says you can't destroy or make energy but it can be stored. so if it's stored at the hill height the cart will speed up making it go faster and the car will then make it to the end.  when I tested it the PE energy changes to KE as it goes down and the PE switches to KE really fast.  We chose 3 as our hill height because it's big enough but not too big for the car to not make it over and still be fun. with the extra hill, the cart will be able to go fast and make it past the loop finishing the roller coaster. We added a loop to make it more fun,  with the loop, the energy will spread throughout the loop making the cart finish with speed.
