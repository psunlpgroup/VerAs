The drop height of my roller coaster design is five meters. This is becauseâ€¦ The height mixed with energy is just swapping like as PE is say 2,445,  KE is 0J But as the cart goes down the KE goes from 0J all the way to 2,445. And PE on the other hand swaps to 0J while TE stays 2,445.
So therefore different increases in height will change and decrease. Even though they will change it's only cause of height, mass is gonna change all the results because it will change.


There are many different ways to change the TE but to change the TE you need to change PE so therefore it has requirements.
