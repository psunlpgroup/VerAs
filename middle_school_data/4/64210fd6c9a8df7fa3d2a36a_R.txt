The drop height for my coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the more height you have you will have the more significant PE on the top and a higher KE at the bottom. One example is with a drop height of 2.50 meters the PE at the top was 1334 joules and at the bottom of the drop the KE was at 1333 joules. When compared to a drop height of 5 meters the PE joules at the top were 2668 and the KE at the bottom was 2666 joules. Having a curtain height of a hill is essential, in order to make it up a hill the hill has to be smaller than the initial drop but if it is taller or the same height it will not make it over. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states that energy can't be created or destroyed. At the initial drop of 5 meters, the PE is at 2668 joules but at the bottom of the drop, the PE is at 0. That is because the energy will be transformed into KE on the way down because, at the top of the drop KE joules are at 0 but at the bottom, KE is at 2666 joules. potential energy transforms into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy converts into potential energy, and then back again. The total energy doesn't change tho it will always stay at the same number it is just put into didn't different energy, for example, PE is put into KE or thermal energy. The mass of the cart also matters, with a larger mass, there will be more energy. for example, with a cart mass of 40kg the PE at the top of the drop would be at 1957 joules compared to a mass of 60kg where the PE would be 2936 joules of energy. THIS WAS DONE IN A FRICTIONLESS SIMULATION.
