Dear Gondolas Family Some co-workers and I plan on trying to help you make a roller coaster ride for your park we found some things to help that I will tell you in the next few paragraphs.

We think that the smiler would be a great addition to your park. We have tested a few things and the first thing I would like to discuss is the height that I think is best for your roller coaster. So we can make this ride the best ride for the riders we should make the height for the initial drop 5.00. The initial drop should be 5.00 because the PE at the top of the drop was enough to let it get over hills for example the PE at the top was 2443 and at the bottom KE was at 0. This shows that we will have enough energy to send the cart at fast speeds.

Another thing we should discuss is the height of the hill I think the height of the hill should be 3.00. I think it should be 3.00 because it is low enough that we have enough KE to get over the hill. We have 518 KE at the bottom of the hill which will go down the more we go up and go up the more we go down so it's enough to help us get over the hill. But make sure that your hill is smaller than your drop or you won be able to make it over.

The last thing I think we should discuss is the mass of the cart. We should have the mass of the cart at 50. The cart should be at 50 because the bigger the mass of the cart the faster we go. The cart's PE at the top of the drop was 1566 and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 1952. So I think we should have it at 50 because then it's the perfect weight to get the cart to go fast and still get over the hills.

In conclusion, I think you should the Smiler to your park. Because it has the perfect hill height to give riders that thrill. It has the drop at the start to get the roller coaster moving. And it has the perfect mass of the cart to give the riders the feeling that they are going fast.
