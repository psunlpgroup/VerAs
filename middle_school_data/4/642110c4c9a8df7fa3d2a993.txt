I think that we should use the top height to give it the most pe and ke.I think this becouce the faster it goes the more fun it is.For the hill i think that we should have it to where its at 4 becuase when ive done a rollercoaster its more fun when you go up and almost stop then go back down.For the mass i think that we should put it at 45 becuase its not to light but it also is not to heavy so this will still give it a good amount of pe and ke.Adding onto the inisial drop i think that also by putting it higher will make it so then it can go up a higher hill.
