Dear Gonzales family

I have been researching about roller coaster and have picked a good design.
I would start my roller coaster with a initial height of 5 meters.
The reason why I picked that height is that the car gets more speed so it goes over the hills.
As the height increases, the PE increases.This mean that the cart will have more KE after it starts to go down the hill.
I found this in my data. in my experiments, when the height was 3.05 Meters and the PE was 1495 Joules.
When the height was 5 meters the PE was 2453 Joules.
I would make my hill height 3.19 meters tall, I picked this height so that my cart would be able to make it go over the hill.
If the hill was 5 m, the cart would not be able to make it over the hill, Because there is not enough energy to make it over the hill.
I would make my cart weigh 60 kg, because an increase of mass is an increase is total energy. For example, in my experiments when the cart was 40 kg, the total was 1213 J. Also when the cart was 60 kg, the total energy was 1867 J.
The law of conservation of energy states that the energy can't be created or destroyed but it can converted into different forms.
In a roller coaster with no friction, the total energy equals the PE + KE.
In a roller coaster with a friction, some of the energy will be converted into heat energy.
