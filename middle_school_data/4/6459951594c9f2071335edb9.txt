Dear Gonzales family, I have found out how to make the best roller coaster. To have the most energy you need to have a higher initial drop. Having a higher initial drop gives the roller coaster more total energy which makes it faster. When the roller coaster car moves down the hill it converts its potential energy into kinetic energy. The kinetic energy and potential energy combined make the total energy. The law of conservation of energy shows us that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This means that if you add a hill to the roller coaster it has to be shorter than the initial drop.
