The relationship to the height and the PE at the top of the drop is the height of the drop makes PE go up or.down whether or not it moves. So when the drop is really high then the PE will be high and when the drop is really low the PE will be low .and with in the middle it will follow the same rules.The KE at the bottom of the drop and the drop height is going to be the same as the PE, at. the top of the drop when the height of the drop is low the KE at the bottom will be low but .when it is high it will just follow it so that means it will be high also.

The relation ship between PE,KE and TE is when the PE starts out high it means every thing else will follow. So that means when the PE starts high in numbers then all of the other numbers turn out to be high numbers. The total energy it when they PE and KE got to the highest point.

The changes in PE and KE going down the drop it is starting at PE.it does that because when you are at the top of the hill the PE is high because it has PE to drop. Then it transfers in to KE while going down the hill because KE is the energy while moving.

the law of conservation of energy transforms in to energy when it starts to go down the hill.

The drop height has to be taller then the hill height to make it over the hill it does not matter how much smaller but. it has to be smaller.

The relation ship between mass and KE and PE is when the car has a lot of weight then it will make it harder for the PE to push it up the hill after dropping. The KE will do the opasit because it is the energy while moving.
