Dear Gonzales Family, 
If I were to design a roller coaster for Gonzales Park. I would make it known for its speed and its enjoyability before you ride. It would be called the Godzilla to kinda reference the name of the park and it would have a room that you enter showing the backstory about Godzilla and how he is today. Then they will move into a room where they take an elevator to a platform where the ride starts. Then it will have a gassed-powered start to make it go from 0-70  in 1-2 seconds(We will give a warning of course). Then with all the extra PE, it will then have a 40FT drop turning the PE into KE making the slingshot off into a loop. And then a 360-degree turn and then go into a hill which the ride would not be able to go up. Then the ride would start to move backward back through the 360 turn and back through the loop and back to where they started. This ride won't only bring many more to the ride, it will bring many to the park. I think this ride could change the entire future of this Park and changed the entire future of your guys' lives, and many more think a ride like the Godzilla would be one of the best decisions of your life.
