Dear Gonzallas Famly. 

this is a design that is safe and fun.

First of all. the relationship between PE and KE. Is PE converts into KE. and KE converts into PE. and back again. also energy is never created. or destroid. the ID height of the drop will be 5m. It is this high because. We need it to have enough PE, KE, and TE. to make it through the whole ride. we need PE to have enough speed. We have found this information. By testing designs that have. Different drop heights. In trial 1 we started with 2 drop height. that got us 977J PE (top).  977J KE (bottom). In the 2nd trial, we raised it up to 2.75 and the PE (top). Was 1343J. KE (bottom) 1343J. and 1343J TE. From our data, it seems like 5m is the best. 

For the hill height, We decided on 2.5. We made this choice Because in trial 1. we started with 2.5 and the PE (top). was 1277J. and the KE (top). was 485J. and the car can make it over the hill. 3 also works the PE (top). for that was 1474J. and the KE (top). was 240J. and the total energy for both. was 1714J. We want to go with 2.5 just to be safe.

For the car mass. we have decided we will use 44 car mass. We will use this. because it is pretty lightweight. In trial one we used 40 car mass. For our data, the PE (top). was 1958J. and the KE was 1753J. and the TE was 1958J. In trial 2 data we used 44 car mass. We got 2151J PE (top). and 1951J KE (bottom). and for TE we got 2151. That's why we chose 44.
