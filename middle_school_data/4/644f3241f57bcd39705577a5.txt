Dear Gonsales Family
My company designed a fun and safe roller coaster we hope that this will make your amusement park and yes we know that it is ready and here is some proof that it is ready.
 The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4.50 meters. This is because it is fun, safe, and has enough energy to the end. For example, when I tested the drop height of 4.50 meters, the PE was 1893. When I increased the drop height to 4.50 meters, the PE increased Joules like Trail 1 3.19 when you increased the PE at the initial drop it is now 1557. Trail 2
