The initial drop should be 5m because the height gives more PE. The data shows that the initial drop of 2m with a 50 kg cart gives 977J of PE, and the initial drop of 5m with a 50 kg cart gives 2443J of PE, so there is a direct relationship between PE and height.
There is a direct relationship between PE and KE. If you stay up at the 5m drop, you have 2443J of PE. However, when you go down, you have 2443J of KE. On a 4m drop at the top, you have 1955J of PE, then at the bottom get 1955J of KE. The PE decreases and the KE increases when you go down the drop. The opposite happens when you go up a hill, the KE decreases and the PE increases.
TE is the sum of KE and PE in a vacuum. TE will always remain constant throughout the entire ride. For example, TE is the same as PE if you are not moving at the top of the initial drop, so at a 5m initial drop, the PE is 2443J, with 0J of KE. Combine PE and KE and get the TE which is 2443J. TE is the same at the bottom of the initial drop too, with 0J of PE and 2443J of KE, and a TE of 2443J.
The hill height should not be too high but not too short either, because a tall hill height won't make the car make it to the end but too short of a hill is not that fun. So the hill height should be 4.5m in a vacuum, because going up, you are transferring KE to PE. You need KE to move, so if the hill is also 5m, you won't have enough TE to make it up. For example, at the top of a 5m hill, you have 2449J of TE, 2446J of PE, and 3J of KE, but won't make the hill. With a 4m hill height, at the top of the hill, the car has 2448J of TE, 1943J of PE, and 505J of KE, and will make it through the hill. So, therefore, hill height and initial drop height are a direct relationship.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. In a vacuum, there is a direct relationship between drop height and hill height, because the higher the hill, the greater the drop height needs to be to overcome the hill. The evidence shows that a 5m drop and a 5m hill will not make the hill, but a 5m drop and a 4m hill will make the hill.
The car weight is not that important for this rollercoaster, but if you increase the mass, you increase the TE and if you decrease the mass, you decrease the TE. It is a direct relationship. A 60 kg cart with a 5m drop has 2932J of TE. However, a cart with 40kg has only 1955J of TE, but it will also reduce the energy needed to accelerate the car, so in reality, keeping it at 50kg will not have any benefits or cons.
