Hello Gonzales family, 
The design that I have created has an initial drop height of 5 m I chose this because when the initial drop height is tall the car has a better chance of making it to the end of the track. There is a direct relationship between the height of the initial drop and the PE the car has at the top of the initial drop. I know this because according to my data when the hill is 2.5 m tall the PE is 2444 J. But when the height is 5 the PE is 2449. So the PE goes up when the height goes up. There is a direct relationship between the height of the initial drop and the KE  has at the bottom of the initial drop. I know this because the inital drop was 2.5 m the KE was 1221 at the bottom of the hill. But when the release height was 4.2 the KE was 2053 at the bottom of the hill. This shows the direct relationship between the KE and the height. 

I am going to be making the mass of the car be 60. I choose this because the more mass the car has the faster it will go. And I want a very fast car. There is a direct relationship between the mass of the car and the PE the car has at the top of the initial drop. I know this because my data shows that when the mass of the car was 45 the PE was 1614 J. But when the mass was 55 the PE was 1964 J. There is a direct relationship between the mass of the car and the KE the car has at the bottom of the initial drop. I know this because my data shows that when the mass of the car was 45 the KE was 1612 J. But when the mass was 55 the KE was 19643 J. 

I am planning to make the hill 3 m tall. I am doing this because you have to have a hill that's shorter than the initial drop otherwise it will not make it to the end. When I had the inital drop height as 5 m and had the hill as 5 m the car did not make it to the end of the track. 

Thank you for letting me explain my idea to you I hope you take this into consideration.
