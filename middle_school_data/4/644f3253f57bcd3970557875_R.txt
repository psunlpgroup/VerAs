Dear Gonzales family, 
The engineering company that I work for believes that the drop height of the rollercoaster should be 5m tall. And the hill height should be 3m tall and the mass of the car should be 50kg.
	
I believe the rollercoaster's drop height should be 5m tall because. When I had the drop height at 4.25m the PE was 2079j then when I had the drop height at 5m the PE was 2443j so when there is more height there larger the PE is bigger and the more fun. 

I think the hill height should be 3m because when I had the hill height at 2m and the drop at 5m the car was able to get over the hill. And when I had the hill height at 5m and the drop height at 5m the car was not able to get over so if the hill height was bigger than the drop the car is not going to be able to get over.

I think that the car mass should be 50kg because the car can not be too heavy or it will be too heavy for the track and it will be too slow then you can't have that much fun.
