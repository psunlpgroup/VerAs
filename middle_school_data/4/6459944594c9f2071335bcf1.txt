Dear Gonzales family,
After giving careful consideration, and research into a rollercoaster design, I have come up with some factors that are critical for the rollercoaster, and some design work that will bring all these ideas to life.
      The rollercoaster design that I have created is an elaborate and exciting journey on the tracks. There will be fun twists and turns that will excite the rider, and the rollercoaster will e designed with the correct track length, hills, and drop so that the car can make it to the end. 
      Some data from our testing shows that a higher drop will allow us to give the car more speed, which will increase excitement, and will allow for our twists, turns, and hills to be safe, and conquerable by the rollercoaster car. In our experiment regarding car mass, we learned that a car with more mas will have more Potential Energy which will allow it to more easily reach the end of the track, and be able to get, and maintain higher speeds. For example, when the car mass was 60kg, the PE was 2935. But when the car mass was 50kg, the PE was 2446.
     We also can confidently say that the hills on the ride are able to be very tall, but not as tall or taller than the drop. This will cause the car to go back to the start, and not make it to the end. For example, when the hill height was the same as the drop in trial 2, the car did not make it to the end, but when th hill height was 0.30 meters shorter in trial number 4, the car made it to the end
     I hope that these will help understand our design, and help how some of the barriers we have when constructing this coaster. 
     Thanks! - Logan Bright
