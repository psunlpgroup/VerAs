Dear Gonzales Family, We are going to set the ID at 4.5m, so it's fun but a little scary and still somewhat safe. If we make the ID at 4.5m it will be fast, making the PE at the top of the ID 2198j, and the KE 2199j at the bottom causing the TE to come out to 2199j. We are going to make the HH 3.25m, making the PE at the top of the hill 1597j and the KE at the top of the hill 117j making the TE 1714j. We are thinking of putting the car mass as 45kg so it is not too fast. That causes the PE at the top of the ID to be 1326j. Also making the KE at the bottom of the ID the same and the TE the same.
