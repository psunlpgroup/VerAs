for starters, it has a 4m intial drop that is inverted. then goes into a 3m loop. And and 2m hill after that then going under the ground, and then stoping on a flat serface. the Intial drop is higher then the hill. so that it will have enough energy to make it to the end of the track. The cart will make it to the end. Because the amount of energey,, from the intial drop will be enough to go though the loops. And hill even if friction changing enrgey to thermal energey. So the Pe at the top will tranfer to enough ke at the bottom, to make it though the loop and hills. the pe and the ke will switch off energy to have it so the total of both always equal the same. And sence force can not be created or destoyed. The cart will make it to the end. with the energy moving from pe to ke. and the drop hight is 4m compared to the loop that is 3m. that is a differants of 1m giving it plenty of energy to make it over. Also in are data the more mass you have the more total energy you have. but it also will take more energrey to get up the hills. like in the experament the car the was 60 kg. Which had more energy then the 50kg car and the 40kg car. but also the 50kg car had more energy then the 40kg car. This is without frction. In the real world the out come would be bifferent. Because, some of you energy would be turned into thermal energy.
