          The Gonzales family is wanting a roller coaster with the most excitement. I would tell them that they would need a coaster with the biggest initial drop, a big first hill, and the biggest coaster car. These conditions would give them the most "exciting" car.
          To start, potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE) work off of each other. They share the total energy (TE) and the TE just switches and changes between KE and PE. So working with that, in order to start with the most PE, the initial drop needs to be as high as possible to generate the most PE and TE. In this case, 5 M is as high as possible. 
          We know that drop height is related to TE and PE because when the initial drop height was 3 m, the PE was 1466 J. And when it was 5 m, PE was 2443 J.
