For your roller coaster, you will need to have an initial drop higher than the rest of your roller coaster that way the potential energy at the start can carry the car to the end with a high initial drop. You will also need a big mass to carry you to the end. For the initial drop if the height of it is five meters then you will need to have hills/loops shorter than it otherwise it will not make it to the end. That potential energy will turn into kinetic energy at the bottom. Even though the energy transfers the amount will stay the same throughout the whole ride. An example is if the amount of potential energy was 1,264J at the start and at the end, the kinetic energy would be the same 1,264J this is also known as the law of conservation of matter where matter cannot be created or destroyed. But one of the most important parts is that since energy cannot be created or destroyed the energy at the start will be the same at the end also known as total energy
