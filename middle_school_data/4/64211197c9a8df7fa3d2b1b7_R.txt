The higher the drop the more energy because it will have more energy. When I dropped it at 5 meters I had 2443 joules and when I had 4 meters I had 1944 joules. TE is the total energy. When they are the PE converts to KE with no gaining or losing energy. You can see this with I had the hill at 5 meters I wasn't able to make it up the hill but when I had the hill at 4 meters I was able to make it over the hill. When you are dealing with the energy you can not gain or lose energy but you can transfer energy. When you go down the initial drop you gain speed and KE you can see the KE in my data. Once you start going up the hill you lose height and gain PE. The more mass the more PE and KE as it is shown in my data. When I had my initial drop at 5 meters and hill at 4 meters with 45 kilograms I had 2210 joules and that was less energy than 50 kilograms I had 2445 joules.
