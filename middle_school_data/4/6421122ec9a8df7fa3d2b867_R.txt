The height of the drop will determine if the energy will be larger or if it will be smaller. The smaller the height, the smaller or less amount of potential energy. The larger or taller height, the more potential energy than the smaller drop. Let's say that you had a 50kg cart and you have a 5 m drop with no friction, the potential energy would be 2442 joules. But if you had a 50 kg cart and a 2 m drop, the potential energy would be 978 joules, so less energy than the higher drop. The same amount of energy that is put into the potential energy at the top, the same amount of kinetic energy will be at the bottom. The total energy will be the same amount as the initial potential energy or the same amount as the kinetic energy at the bottom. The only time that the kinetic energy wouldn't equal the total energy is if the potential energy was converted into thermal energy while going down the drop.  Changes between the potential and kinetic energy during the drop include the potential energy will decrease and being put into increasing kinetic energy so then the kinetic energy is equal to the initial potential energy amount. The only time the kinetic energy would be less than the initial potential energy amount would be when the energy was transformed into thermal energy. The energy wouldn't be lost because of the law of conservation of energy. Also, the initial drop height cannot be smaller than the hill height, or else the roller coaster car will not make it over the hill. If you don't have enough potential energy, the cart won't make it over the hill because the cart loses the potential energy by going down the initial drop. The mass is the only controlled variable of the mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy.
