Some recommendations that I think will be helpful for the Gonzales family is my huge roller coaster thats exciting and fast my reasoning comes from my data that I pulled from the roller coasters. My data from my first roller coaster. My first test is the release height the number is 3.49m then the pe at top of initial drop and the number is 0 the ke top of inital drop is 2437 then the pe top of hill is 1706 ke top of hill is 741 my total energy is 2447 and it did made it to the end. Now my second trail's hill height is 2.50 pe top of initial drop is 42 and the ke top of initial drop is 2401 pe top of hill is 1214 and ke top of hill is 1228 the total energy is 2443 and it did made it to the end. my third trail's hill height is 2.50 the pe top of initial drop is 1 ke top of initial drop is 1233 and the pe top of hill is 1221 ke top of hill is 2 and the total energy is 1223 and it didnt made it to the end. So the best one would be the second one.
