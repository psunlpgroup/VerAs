I believe that my design or the Gonzales roller coaster would be the best. Because it is tall will attract an audience so will attract more people and they will make more money. What I believe is the best for them to do is make a roller coaster with a tall drop height example 5.00 m. compared to a different roller coaster at 3.65M the roller coaster with the higher meters will have more PE, The higher the drop the more PE it will have the smaller the drop the less PE it will have. A hill will be added to slow down the coaster so it has a smoother ride to the end. The hill height will have to be something smaller than the initial drop height because the coaster will not make it over and people will not want to ride the coaster. So the hill will be small enough for the coaster to cross over it will have less kinetic energy when it reaches the top of the hill KE. And about half the PE it had at the top of the drop making it safer. While the roller coaster is going down the hill that pe from the tall drop is turning into kinetic energy which means that the energy that can be potentially stored up is being used. And potential energy means how much energy can be in an object another thing to keep in mind is that the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It only transfers from the two different types. Another thing is that the more mass the coaster has will also affect the PE and KE of the coaster. More mass means more PE and more KE so I believe that the mass of the coaster shouldn't be too heavy or too light. KE+PE=TE, the relationship between KE and PE is they can transform into one another. This is why I believe the Gonzalez family should choose my roller coaster.
