My team's roller coaster works so well mostly because of the initial drop height. The higher the initial drop height, the higher the PE at the top, meaning the KE at the bottom will be higher as well. This can be explained by the inverse relationship between KE and PE: when one goes down, the other goes up. TE in a frictionless environment is KE plus PE, but in a non-frictionless environment, TE accounts for all other types of energy and adds them all up.If the goal is to make the roller coaster as exciting as possible, it is essential to get the highest speed possible. Setting the initial drop height to the highest possible amount (5 meters in the simulation) will allow for the highest amount of KE at the bottom of each drop, which is the applied energy making the coaster move so fast. When adding a hill to the coaster, the hill height must be lower than the drop height. The coaster will be unable to get over the hill if the drop and hill heights are the same because it would be putting in the same amount of energy. It would get to the top of the hill but would not go over it. This is because energy can't be created or destroyed, and the PE at the top of the hill transforms into KE as the coaster goes down. In a frictionless environment, it will put in the exact same amount of energy going down the initial drop as it will going up the hill, meaning it is unable to get over the hill. As for the mass of the car, the higher the mass, the higher the PE at the top and KE at the bottom. This is because there is more of the object going down the hill, which increases energy and therefore speed. In conclusion, there are a few steps you need to follow in order to make the roller coaster ride as fun as possible. Set your initial drop height very high,  make sure your hill height is high but not as high as the initial drop, and ensure your car mass is high.
