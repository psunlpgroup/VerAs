Roller coasters that have an initial drops, and hills make it exciting. This is why, the height of your initial drop relates to your PE at the top and the KE at the bottom. Here is how, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be destroyed nor made. So the amount of energy from the top of the roller coaster is how much energy you have. When you go down the hill all of the PE moves to be KE. So at the top you may have 2,443 PE but then at the bottom of the hill you only have 1 PE. Meanwhile the KE has 0 at the top while 2,442 at the bottom. You also have the relationship between PE,KE and total energy and how it affects the ride. The more the energy you have at the start the better. If you only have 1,000 KE the ride is going to be pretty boring. But if you have a ride with 2,400 that ride is going to be exciting. The less energy you have the more it is going to be boring. Hills are tricky, The hill and the initial drop can't be the same. Because if they are then the cart can't go over. There isn't enough energy to go over the hill if they are the same height. For example if the initial drop is 5m and the Hill height is 5m. It won't make it over it will just go back and forth and go nowhere.Meanwhile if you had a initial drop that was 5m while the hill height was 4m it can make it over. So the initial drop has to more than the hill height otherwise it won't make it. There is also mass. The more mass you have the more energy you will have. For example if your cart weights 40 kg it will have a total energy of 1,958. But, if you cart weighs 60kg it will have a total energy of 2,937. That is all you have to know about roller coaster to make a good design.
