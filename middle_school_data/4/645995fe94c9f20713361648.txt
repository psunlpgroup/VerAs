The height of the drop relates to the PE on the top because the more speed you have the more PE you will have because as you go up the hill before you go down, it starts building up more and more speed. 
Until it finally has enough speed to go down the hill. 
As you are going up it takes a little while, until like I said it needs more speed to be able to go or finish the roller coaster. 
But as you go down you get KE which makes the roller coaster go slower, it starts slowing down. As it slows down the KE comes in. 
To help the ride have a slower stop instead of going really fast, so the people might fall off the ride or get hurt.
The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is that PE is how much speed it needs, the KE is when how fast it is going. 
How much total energy it would need for the ride for it to be able to work, and go fast each time.
