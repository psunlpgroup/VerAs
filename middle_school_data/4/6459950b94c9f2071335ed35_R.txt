Dear the Gonzales family,
I have a few suggestions on how to make your roller coaster, fun, safe, and the best it can be.
The first thing I recommend is that the starting drop height is as tall as it can be, for my research, I used 5m because it was the tallest. Having a tall starting drop is fun for the people riding and has the most energy, helping you get over the hill. An example of this is, when the initial height was 2m the total energy was 977j but when the initial drop was 5m the total energy was 2443j.
I recommend the hill is smaller than the initial drop, this will ensure that the cart gets over the hill. In my research when the hill and initial drop were the same height the cart couldn't get over the hill, but when the hill was even a little bit smaller than the initial drop it went over. This is because, at the top of the initial drop, the energy is all potential energy, not Kinetic energy. As the cart goes down the hill the potential energy switches over to kinetic energy, as it goes back up the hill the two balance out so if there is not enough of both the cart will not make it over. This is because the law of conservation and energy which states that energy can not be created or destroyed. (Examples: hill height-5m initial drop height-5m=2451j total energy, at the top of the hill there was 2451j potential energy and no kinetic energy, meaning the cart was not moving and couldn't get over the hill. Hill height-2m initial drop height-5m=2444j total energy, at the top of the hill there was 1462j potential energy and 982j kinetic energy since there was still kinetic energy there the cart made it over the hill).
finally, I recommend the cart is as heavy as it can be. Because the heavier the cart the more energy when my cart was 40kg on a 5m initial drop the total energy was 1959j, but when my cart was 60kg on a 5m initial drop the total energy was 2939j.
Please use these recommendations when building your new roller coaster.
