Dear Gonzales family, I have collected some great useful data to help you build the best/most safe roller coast for your amusement park. The intentional drop height from my roller coaster started at 5 meters tall. The PE at the top was 2932 joules and the KE was 0. Soon once the cart starts to drop the energy transfers to the other also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy. The PE switches over to the KE at the bottom of the drop but goes back up again when moving up the hill. This shows the PE all differentiates based on the height.   Then once the cart reaches the top of the hill the PE and KE are switched by then. This explains how PE and KE have this strong relationship when dealing with the transformation of energy.  As the cart goes down the hill the energy switch for the 3rd time very similar to the first drop but by now the cart has a little bit less energy due to friction. Also the more Mass the car has at the start the more energy/joules the cart contains. For example when doing the mass data the cart that weighed 45 kg had 1957 joules at the top while the cart that had a mass of 55 kg weighed 2688 joules. Lastly the sum of KE and PE is equivalent to the TE.
