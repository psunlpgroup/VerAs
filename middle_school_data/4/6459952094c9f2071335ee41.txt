Dear, Gonzales family
Our team has amazing recommendations for your roller coaster design. That will make your roller coaster the best in a design way and an exciting way.

One recommendation that we have to you is that the initial drop will affect the TE. Because the higher the initial drop is the more TE it will have which means more KE and more speed from that PE. And, the more PE there is the more KE there will be. Like in a 5m high initial drop the coaster had 2443 PE and at a height of 2m it only had 977. So overall its more fun.

Another recommendation that we have to you is that you will need to make the hill height shorter than the initial drop because if the hill height is equal or higher than the initial drop the car won't fully make it to the end. Because, as the car is going down the hill it won't have enough KE and PE to make it up the higher hill. Like when the initial drop and the hill height were the same the car didn't make it to the end. So overall it means it will be better overall.

Another recommendation that we have to you is the more mass the car has the more TE it will have which means more KE and PE. And the more PE it has the more KE it has so it can get across the length of the track faster and better. Like a car with a mass of 60kg has 2777 TE will a 40kg car only has 1958 TE. So, overall more fun. 

The final recommendation that we have to you is that the law of conservation of energy states that "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can convert from one type of energy to another". Which means the TE will stay the same throughout the whole ride but the only thing that will change is the conversion from the PE to KE. Like it doesn't matter if the hill height is short or high or if the initial drop is short or high no matter what the TE will be the same throughout the whole ride.

In, conclusion these were 4 amazing recommendations my team and I have for you to make your roller coaster be the best and feel the best.
