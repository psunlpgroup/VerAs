I designed a roller coaster that I think will be the safest yet most exciting by using the Law of Conservation of Energy. To start off the coaster, the height of the initial drop will be 5 meters minimum which will have the highest Potential Energy and convert enough Kinetic Energy to make it up the hill. 

This brings me to my next point, the height of the hill. During the SIM, I tested many heights that were valid and found that the hill must be less than the initial drop in order to make it to the end. 

The relationship between PE and KE is that they always shift back and forth but the total energy always stays the same.  Normally, the Potential Energy is determined by the initial drop. For example, when I tested the drop height to 3 meters the PE was 1446 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased to 2443 Joules. 
This also applies to the total energy being a dependent variable on mass. Mass will dictate if the PE + KE is higher or lower. For example, when the car Is 40kg, the PE at the top of the initial drop is 1955, and the KE at the bottom is 1945. Then, I tested a 60kg car, and the PE at the initial drop was 2932 and the KE at the bottom was 2927. This shows that the more the car mass, the more PE and KE there is. 

Next, there is a direct relationship between PE, KE, and total energy. How I know this is that the PE will always be the amount of total energy at the initial drop because that is the amount of energy that it will produce throughout the entire ride. The KE will always be less than the potential and total but the potential and kinetic energy together will always equal the total energy. The  Law of Conservation of Energy states that when one form of energy is transferred to another now energy is created or destroyed in the process.
