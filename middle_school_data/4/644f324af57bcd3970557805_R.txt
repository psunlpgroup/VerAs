Dear Gonzales family,

We have tested multiple heights, drops, and loops and finally found the correct measurements and hill heights for your new roller coaster we also understand that if we increase our heights our P.E. will also increase in case we need to add adjustments. First, we should start with our ID ( Initial Drop ) height. We decided on the size of 3.35m we chose this because we believe that if the Initial Drop is more significant than the Hill Height and loop height the car will make it to the end of the coaster we also want to make sure the height is safe. At this point of the ride, the coaster will be at its highest amount of P.E. because the more mass or height an object has the more P.E. it obtains. Next, we chose the Hill Height for this we decided on the height of 2.75m, because as I said the Hill Height needs to be smaller than the ID height we did recognize that this height was similar to the ID but we believe it will still work because when the Hill Height is higher or lower then the ID height the KE is higher than zero. Then, we chose the Loop height for this we decided on 2m because we knew that this height would have to be shorter and decrease from the others because if any height is larger than the ID height the car will not make it to the end because it’s mass would weigh it down and it would fail if you added friction.
Lastly, we chose the car mass of 55kg this will make sure that the car will reach the end of the coaster. The law of conservation states that, Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but…it can convert from one type of energy to another.” So when our car reaches the end of the coaster its P.E will convert into K.E and then it will turn into T.E in the end.
