Dear Gonzalez Family

Me and my team have conducted some experiments to figure out the best design for the new roller coaster with it being safe and still very fun for the customers. To first start off the initial drop has to be the tallest point on the whole roller coaster. One of the experiments we conducted, we had the initial drop point set at 4 meters and the first hill at 4 meter and the cart did not make it up. With the 4 meter drop the potential energy started off at 1646 joules and the kinetic energy at the top of the 4 meter hill was also had a kinetic energy of 1646. But when we dropped the cart from 3.5 the cart had no issue of getting over the hill. The starting potential energy was 1646 because that doesn't change and at the top of the hill it was 1437 because there was still movement for there to still have some kinetic energy. As well, the higher the mass the higher the kinetic and potential energy that the cart has. When there is no friction the energy stays the same when it transforms from kinetic to potential energy, and the totals of both of the energy stay the same. But once you put on the friction the cart's total energy won't be the same as the potential energy to start or the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill. The kinetic energy at the start is always 0 while the potential energy will be the highest the number will ever be. Once the cart makes it down to the bottom of the hill all of the potential energy then turns into kinetic energy. Then potential then gets turned into 0 energy but the total energy is the potential energy at the beginning or the kinetic energy at the bottom which is the same number. The Law of conservation of energy law states that no energy is lost or gain while an object is moving. We can apply that to our experiments because no kinetic or potential energy was higher then the other.
