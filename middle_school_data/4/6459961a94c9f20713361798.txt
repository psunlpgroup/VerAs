      To make the best and most fun roller coaster they would want to make it very tall. Another thing they would want to do is make the slopes not as tall as the initial hill. lastly they would want to make the car heavier.
      The first thing they should do is make it very tall. The reasoning to this is, the higher the drop the more potential energy and kinetic energy there will be, meaning the cart will be faster and making it more fun.
       The next thing they should is is make the slopes not as tall as the initial drop. This is because if they build it that way the cart will not have enough kinetic energy to make it over the slope. As the cart begins to climb in altitude again, kinetic energy is lost and potential energy is restored. Once the kinetic energy runs out and has not yet made it over the slope, it will fall backwards and get stuck in between the initial drop and the slope. 
       The last thing they should do is make the car heavier. I believe they should make the car heavier is because the more the car weighs the more potential energy there is, the more potential energy is the more kinetic energy there will be. This will make the car way faster and more fun. 
        Those are my three suggestions to making a better and more fun ride at the Gonzales family.
