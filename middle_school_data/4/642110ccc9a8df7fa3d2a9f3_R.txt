My recommendations for the new roller coaster is 5m drop height 4m hill height and 60 kg of car mass. With 5 m of hill height you will have lots of potential energy this is because height and PE are a direct relationship. at the top and lots of kinetic energy at bottom. When I did my trial I had 5 ft of hill height my PE at the top was 2443 J and at the bottom zero because KE and PE switched. With more PE at the top of the initial drop you will have more KE at the bottom. More KE results in more speed. This is because to find KE you need velocity more velocity= more speed. The total energy is PE and  KE added together. 

Another recommendation is to have 4 meters hill height. This is because some of the energy will be converted to heat due to gravity. As the PE of the top of the initial drop was 2443 J at the top of the hill 1964 J the Roller coaster did make it to the end. With more KE you will go faster. 

The mass of the kart should be 60 kg this is because at the top of a 5 m drop it had 2932 J of PE at the top and 2930 J of KE at the bottom meaning it went fast.
