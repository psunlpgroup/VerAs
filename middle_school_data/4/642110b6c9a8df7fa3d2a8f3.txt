During the initial drop lab I saw that the car would go down the hill faster when the initial drop was taller. This might be because there is more energy being added then going down a flat hill because it is harder for a roller coaster to move when sitting on a flat surface. When there is a bigger hill there is more force pushing it down the steeper hill. So when I create my roller coaster I am going to make my hill steeper, but not to steep because I do not want there to be to much force that my car falls of the track. Another thing that I could add to my roller coaster that I noticed in the mass and energy lab is that the heavier or more mass the car has the faster it goes down. I think this is because there is less gravity acting on heavier objects so it is easier to pick up speed and it moves down the hill smoother. To add extra KE to my roller coaster I will make my car heavier maybe by adding things to it. Like coins or other things that could help add weight to my car. Finally during the add a hill lab when you make your design to complicated and you add to many hills it takes away KE from the roller coaster. I could not make it up the last hills because I did not have enough energy left in my coaster. So something I am going to do is make my roller coaster less complicated and not add so many hills that I run out of energy and are not able to make it to the end.
