We decided to pick 3.35m for the initial drop height. We decided to pick it because it isn´t too high or too low, it also is high enough for a hill to be a good height. At the bottom of our Initial Drop, the KE is 1342 and the PE at the top of the Initial Drop is 1638. We chose 2.75m as our hill height so the cart can make it over the hill. When the car is going down the hill the KE and PE change into different numbers, but if you add them together it equals the TE which is 1713. We chose to make the Initial Drop higher than the Hill Height. The car wouldn´t make it over the Hill if the Initial Drop was lower than the Hill Height so the cart wouldn't have enough energy to make it up.

We chose a hill height of 2.75m. We needed it to be lower than the initial drop so the cart can make it over the hill. The PE at the top of the hill is 1350. The KE at the top of the hill height is 362J. The TE at the top of the Hill is 1713J. The cart will make it to the end of the coaster with a Hill Height of 2.75m.

We chose a car mass of 55kg. We chose this car mass because it won't be difficult to make it to the end of the coaster. When the car mass was at 55kg the cart did make it to the end of the rollercoaster. When the mass of the cart was higher it made it to the end of the rollercoaster but it didn't go as fast. So it wouldn't be as fun for the riders to ride the coaster. It also wouldn´t draw much attention to your park.
