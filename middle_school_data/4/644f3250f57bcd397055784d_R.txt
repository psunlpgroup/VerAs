Dear Gonzales family,

I’ve made a roller coaster design for your amusement park. It is safe and exciting for your guests. The initial drop will be 5m and the hill height will be 3.30m so the roller coaster car can go over loops and hills quickly and easily. Because when the hill height is taller than the initial drop it won’t have enough energy to go through the track. When a force is applied to the roller coaster car the energy turns from potential energy to kinetic energy. The roller coaster car's mass is 55 kg because the bigger the mass of the car the bigger the momentum and force you need to go around the track. Because the more mass the more kinetic energy. Depending on the motion of the roller coaster car the kinetic energy changes back a forth from potential energy to kinetic energy.
