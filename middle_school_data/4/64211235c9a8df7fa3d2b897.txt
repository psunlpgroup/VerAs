Dear Gonzales family, here are some recommendations for the best roller coaster design. The relationship between the drop height and the hill height is very important. If your hill height is taller than your drop height the car will not have enough energy to get over the hill. But if your drop height is taller than your hill height the car will have enough energy to get over the hill. This is because the initial PE at the drop height will depend on the amount of energy needed to get over the hill. The height of the drop relates to the PE at the top and KE at the bottom because however much PE you have will help that car get down the hill. But once at the bottom, the KE will take over that energy helping it get up the hill. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy will also be very important to the best roller coaster design. This is because if you think about PE and KE in our car when the car is at the top of our drop height it will have the most PE. But once it goes down the hill it will lose that PE and gain KE. But what about the total energy? The total energy will have no PE but all KE because the total energy will be at the bottom of the hill. Energy transformation involved is PE swapping with KE while going down a hill and KE swapping with PE while going up a hill. PE will always be stored while KE will always be in motion. The relationship between the mass, PE, and KE also all depend on each other. Depending on how much the mass is, can definitely affect if it could get up the hill. The higher the drop height is the more PE the car will have which could give a car with mass more energy to get down and up the hill. But the lower the drop height the mass would not have to be so big because it would not need as much energy. I think that these recommendations will largely affect our roller coaster design.
