At the start of your roller coaster, you will have the initial drop. The higher the initial drop becomes, the more potential energy there will be at the top of the ride. The amount of potential energy depends on the gravitational pull. When more height is gained energy is gained as well. This rule is similar to kinetic energy. At the bottom of the initial drop, we can see that because the cart is in motion, the cart has kinetic energy. The higher the initial drop the more kinetic energy there will be. For example, at the bottom of the initial drop we can see that there was 977 J of kinetic energy when the release height was 2.00 meters and that when the height increased to 5.00 m, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J. To find the total energy we can add the potential energy and the kinetic energy. The total energy is the same as the potential energy at the top of the ride and the same kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop. If we add friction then this is altered but otherwise, this rule is kept constant. Along with that, we can see that the potential energy transfers to kinetic energy due to its motion. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that the total energy of a system stays the same. The next thing we notice is the relationship between the kill height and the initial drop height. Because of the transfer of energy the hill height has to be shorter than the initial drop. If it is higher the amount of kinetic energy will not be able to make it up the hill. In an experiment I did, I noticed that if the initial drop was 4.00 meters the hill height had to be 3.99 meters or less. This shows how we need to have the initial drop height be taller than the height of the hill. We do notice though that if you increase the cart's mass there will be more total energy.
