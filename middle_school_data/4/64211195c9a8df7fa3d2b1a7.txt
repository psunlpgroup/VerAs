My initial drop is 5 meters and the which makes the PE and KE higher because there is more room to fall.
PE and KE at its highest point combined is TE.
As your cart goes down the drop the KE increases and the PE decreases
Energy is never made or lost but can transform.
The drop height has to be slightly higher than the hill height for the cart to be able to go over the hill because when it goes down the initial drop and loses energy as it goes up the hill.
the more mass the more PE and KE because it can get moving faster easier.
