                                         Rollercoaster Essay #1  

Dear Gonzales family,
My company and I have decided on a design we think you will like. We are sending this in letter form because we were unable to meet in person.  

ID Hight 
The drop height of the design is 5 meters exactly this is because of the height and energy. The Total energy at the ID (initial drop) Is 2444J this is because the potential energy of the PE at the top is 2444J but when we get to the bottom the KE will be 2444J. When the Car goes down the ID the KE starts to pick up but on the incline back up the hill the PE starts to puck back up again. 


Hill Height 
I know you wanted the hill to be taller than the drop but when you put the drop lower than the ID it canÂ´t make it over the hill. Because the hill wont have enough potential energy PE to make it over the hill.
