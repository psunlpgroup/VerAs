I would recommend to make the initial drop 5 m because then the PE will be higher, meaning more PE at the beginning the same KE at the end. We tested 4 heights 5, 4, 3, and 2 meters. The drop height of 5 m had a PE of 2492 J at the initial drop. The height of 2 m had a PE of 997 J. From this information, the higher the release height the more PE at the initial drop at the top. Since there is no friction the KE will be what the PE is at the beginning because there is no thermal energy changing the energy into energy we can't use. PE is the energy ready to release and when the cart starts moving it slowly starts changing into KE which is energy when the cart is moving. If there is no KE then there is no velocity. When the cart is at the end it was 0 PE and whatever the PE was at the initial drop. The Law of Conversation of Energy says that energy cant be made or destroyed. Since there is no friction that law is true but if there was then it would turn into TE which is energy we can't use to make the cart move. When all the energy is TE then the cart is at a stop. For the hill height i would recommend a height that is lower than the initial height because it would have enough KE to get over. From out data we tested 5 m and 3 m. For the initial drop we decided on 5 m. First we tested 5 m for the hill height and it did not go over because the PE was the same as it was on top of the Hill. For the 3 m it went over because the PE on the initial drop was more than the PE on the top of the hill. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is the more mass the more energy/KE/PE. We tested 3 masses 51 kg, 45 kg, and 40 kg. For 51 kg it was a PE of 2484 J and for the car mass of 40 kg it was 1956 J. As you can see the lower the mass the lower the PE and KE.
