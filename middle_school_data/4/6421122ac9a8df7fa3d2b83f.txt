I believe the initial drop should be higher than the hill so that it can get over the hill successfully. I know that the hill must be shorter because if it is higher or the same height the cart will not have enough energy to pass over it. With this being said the higher the initial drop the more total energy the cart will have, and therefore the more kinetic energy at the bottom and potential energy at the top. This is because the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy always equals the total energy. This effects the ride because we need more total energy to go over and through parts of the ride. The Total energy is also effected by the mass of the cart, the more mass the cart has the more total energy it has as well. When the cart travels downwards its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. This is because, as the law of conservation of mass states, mass cannot be created or destroyed.
