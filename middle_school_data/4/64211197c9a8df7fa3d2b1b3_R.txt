I would recommend a starting height of 5 meters and a hill height of 3.5 meters to have the most amount of fun and actually get you across the ride. 


The PE and KE depends on the mass and height of the car and initial drop. It depends on the initial drop because the drop will determine how much PE the coaster has at the top and how much KE it has at the bottom of the drop. The mass determines how much PE energy there is and how much KE there is at the bottom of the drop. for example on of my tests with a drop of 5 meters had the most PE then the other hills allowing the ride to have more energy to go further and go faster.

The total energy depends on the PE and KE, for example the higher the PE at the beginning the higher the total energy will be and if the initial drop is lower then the PE will be lower resulting in a lower total energy.

The low of conservation of energy applies to this because the TE always equals the KE + PE and energy cant be created nor destroyed.

That is why i recommend a higher height and a medium size of the hill height.
