The best roller coaster needs to have hills but there is certain requirements for the height of the hill and the weight of the cart. The initial drop needs to be higher than the hill. This is because when the car drops down from the first drop, it needs to have enough potential energy still left in order to make it all the way up the hill and to the end of the ride. As the cart drops down the first drop, the PE and KE start to change. There starts to be less PE and more KE. The amount of total energy between the two will stay the same throughout the whole ride. Because according to the Law of Conservation of Energy, energy can not be created nor destroyed. By the time the cart gets to the bottom of the hill. It will have all KE and no PE, which is the opposite of when its at the starting point. The more total energy a ride has, the faster it will go through the ride. The weight of the cart also matters. The more a cart weighs, the more total energy the coaster will have. The weight also matters when it comes to the height of the drops and hills. The heavier it is, the more energy it will take to get up the hills. Which also relates to the height of the initial drop, because the height needs to be high enough so the cart has enough energy to get it up and over the first hill.
