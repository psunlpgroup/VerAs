for starters, it has a 400 ft intial drop that is inverted. then goes into a 300 ft loop and and 200 ft hill after that then going under the ground, and then stoping on a flat serface. The cart will make it to the end because the amount of energey from the intial drop will be enough to go though the loops and, hill even if friction changing enrgey to thermal energey. So the Pe at the top will tranfer to enough ke at the bottom to make it though the loop and hills. the pe and the ke will switch off energy to have it so the total of both always equal the same. And sence force can not be made or destoyed the cart will make it to the end. and the drop hight is 400 ft compared to the loop that is 300 ft. that is a differants of 100ft giving it plenty of energy to make it over. Also in are data the more mass you have the more total energy you have. but it also will take more energrey to get up the hills. like in the experament the car the was 60 kg had more energy then the 50kg car and the 40kg car. but also the 50kg car had more energy then the 40kg car. This is without frction. In the real world the out come would be bifferent because, some of you energy would be turned into thermal energy.
