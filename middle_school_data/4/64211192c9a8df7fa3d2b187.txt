The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.This is because the higher the height the more mass and the more mass is more KE. For example when I tested the drop height of 2 meters the PE was 1172 Joules. When I tested 5 meters it was 2930 Joules.When I increased the drop height to 5 meters the PE increased to 2930 Joules.



Whenever you add more mass you get more PE and total energy.With more mass means the roller coaster will have more potential to go faster and adds more thrill.The relationship between drop height and hill height is that the drop height has to be bigger than the hill or the coaster won't go over the hill.
