hello, Ganzales family I am pleased to say that have found a safe and fun way to spice up your roller coaster.

first, we would start off with a 60kg cart from a drop height of about 5.00 meters and a hill of 4.00 meters high from a 60kg cart and a 5.00 meter drop the potential energy would be 2937 while the kinetic energy would be 0 so that means that the total energy would be 2937.
but if you ever decide that you don't want it to be so fast then you could do 60 kg and 3.0 meters high with a total PE of 1466 and 0 KE at the top would be a lot less fast but maybe better for kids!

if you want your ride to be faster or more fun then you could start at 60kg and 4.0 hill height with a 5.0-meter drop height. but it is 100% your choice
