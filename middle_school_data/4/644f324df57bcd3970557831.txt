     The drop height of my roller coaster design is 3.35 meters. This is because as you increase the height the PE increases and as the PE increases the KE and TE increase as well. For example, When the initial drop height was 2.75m The PE at the top was 1342j and when the height was 3.35m The PE at the top was 1638. Also when the height was 4m, the PE at the top was 1955j and when the height was 4.5m the PE at the top was 2199j. This data shows that when the height is increased the PE increases. The law of conservation of energy states that Energy cannot be created nor destroyed. This means that as the car goes down the drop, the PE decreases because it is changing into KE ( since PE is energy in rest and KE is energy in motion ). So since when you increase the height you increase the energy, you can’t put your height too high because then it won’t be safe enough that is why I chose 3.35m.
    
        The hill height for the rollercoaster I chose was 2.75m. I chose this because the hill height cannot be higher than the drop height because then the car won’t make it to the end. For example, ( when we didn’t change the initial drop height)  the hill height was 2m and the initial drop height was 3.50m the car made it to the end but when the hill height was 4.25m it didn’t make it to the end. Also when the hill height was 2.75m the car made it but when the hill height was 5m it did not make it to the end. When the hill height was the same as the drop height ( 3.50m ) it didn’t make it. This concludes that the hill height cannot be higher or the same as the drop height other wise the cart won't make it, that is why I chose 2.75m as the hill height.
