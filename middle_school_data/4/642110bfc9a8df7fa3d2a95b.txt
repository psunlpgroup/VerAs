Dear Gonzales family,
  I have been working on the roller coaster design for a few days now; this is what my data tells me. for the initial drop, I think it should be as high as possible because we want lots of potential energy and at the bottom we also want lots of kinetic energy to get to the first hill quickly. Because the law of conservation says you can't create or destroy energy we need the bigger hill as the start. We want to get up the first hill quickly so we don't end up stopping or the car starts to go backward and eventually stop altogether. Saying that we also need to make the first hill less than five so once again the car can get up and over the hill without going backward. we don't want to use much energy on the first hill so there is enough energy to make it through the whole ride. The mass of the car should be 60 because the relationship between the mass of the car and PE is a direct relationship so when the mass goes up so does the PE so the cart will go faster. The same with mass and KE because the bigger mass the more KE it has so it goes much faster. since there is no friction the total energy will stay the same the whole way. There will also be PE at the top of the hill but very little at the bottom and same with KE
