Potential energy is the amount of energy something has based on its position and mass. Kinetic energy is how much energy something has while it is in motion. The mass is an important factor in the total energy because the more mass you have the more energy there is to use because there is more stuff to go somewhere. The height of the initial drop affects the potential energy and kinetic energy because it gives more space for the object to use. When my height was two meters there were 1173 joules total and when I did 5 meters there were 2931 joules. When the hill was higher in the simulation the total energy went up. The total energy is just how much energy there is altogether. When the simulation has friction the total energy was the initial potential energy and the end kinetic energy but without friction, the energy stays the same the whole time. The energy can't be created or destroyed it can be changed into different types of energy though. When friction comes into play the potential energy can be turned into thermal and sound energy so the end energy is less that doesn't mean it was destroyed. The drop height has to be larger than the hill height because there is nothing to propel it up the hill if it is higher because you would need more energy.
