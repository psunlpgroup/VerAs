Rollercoaster Essay #1 
Dear, Gonzales family
I think the best Initial drop height should be 5 
Meters tall. My reason why, is it will have more total energy( PE and KE) so it will have a greater percent chance to make it to the end of the ride because it will have more energy to make it to the end. My evidence is in trial #1, the drop height was 2 meters and the total energy was only 969J, and in trial #5 the drop height was 5 meters and the total energy was 2443J. That's why I think the Initial drop of the roller coaster should be 5 meters tall.

I think the best Hill height should be 3.5 meters tall. My reason why, is it will have enough energy to make it over the hill to make it to the end of the ride.
