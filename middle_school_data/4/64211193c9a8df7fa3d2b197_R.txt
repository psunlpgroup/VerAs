Dear gonzalas family, The drop height of my roller coaster is 4 meters, this is needed because you have to have enough energy to get through the rest of the coaster. The amount of ke and pe are the same through out the coaster. The more mass of the car helps the coaster go faster because when you drop it from the top of the hill it will have more momentum. When you start the drop higher and the hill is long and steep you will get lots of speed. the more mass you have then you have more pe and ke. In the end the more mass and the higher you start you will have more momentum to get through the rest of the track.  The drop height of 5 will have 2440 jules at the top of the initial drop. thanks for your time.
