My recomendation is to start with a 5m so we have the greatest amount of PE at the top and the greatest KE at the bottom. We know the as height increases so does energy. We can see this in our initial drop trials when the PE is 782 J (in trial 1) the KE is also 782 J. When we increase the height of the hill the PE is 1173 J (in trial 2) and so is the KE. This proves that height of the drop relates to the PE at the top and the KE at the bottom, we can also tell from these trials that the PE, the KE, and the TE (total energy) have the same values in each trial. In the initial drop height trials also we know that PE changes to KE as the coaster car goes down the ramp. In our initial drop trials the PE at the top of the hill was 782J the same can be said for the KE at the bottom of the ramp this means that PE transfers into KE.  The amount of mass the car has the more energy our evidence for this is in our mass and energy trials, in the data we can see that when the mass of the car was increased from 40kg to 50kg. When we changed the mass the energy of the car when from 1957J to 2446J, thus prving that mass has a direct relationship with energy. We have decided to give the car a mass of 40 kg. After the initial drop we will have 2 loops, then I hill with a height of 4.5m. The height of the hill is intentionaly slightly lower than the initial drop, this is because the car cannot go up a hill that is higher or the same height as the initial drop. We know this because of our Hills Data, in those trials the car only went up the hill when the hill height was lower than the drop height. At the End of the coaster there will be a bank that goes up 5.5 M. The goal of the ride is for the coaster car to just barely not make it up the hill and then fall back down and do the coaster again but this time backwards. At the end of the ride the car will end up back at the begining then come to a stop using a brake mechanism.
