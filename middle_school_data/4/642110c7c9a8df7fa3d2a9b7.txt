Dear, Gonzales family I would recommend that you increase the mass of the car and make your initial drop somewhat higher so energy can build for all of the hills and loops. This will benefit the ride because friction will already push against the car so you need to have enough energy and mass to get through the whole ride. With more mass, the kinetic energy will build so at the bottom of each hill or even the initial drop there's enough speed to make it over the next. This also includes lowering each hill so gradually making each hill shorter than the one before. Doing this will keep the PE and KE drop significantly decreasing.  One last suggestion would maybe start with a loop so you have enough speed to get around it then continue with hills following it.
