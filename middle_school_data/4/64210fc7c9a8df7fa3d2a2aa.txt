As we start our roller coaster to the height of 5 meters. The potential energy is always going to be more than the Kinetic energy at the top of the initial drop. when I measured the PE at the top of the initial the the PE was 1221 and the KE at the top of the drop was 3. The total energy of the drop between PE and KE was 1222. jewels  When the car was going down the drop PE went down in energy and KE went up in energy. When the PE went down the energy converted  into the KE. The drop height has more energy than the hill height because it has to be smaller than the initial drop to get to the rest of the roller coaster. when the roller car goes down the coaster the PE energy converted into the kinetic energy.
