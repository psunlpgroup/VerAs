Our best roller coaster design will be exciting because its motion will continue. The potential energy will rise and the kinetic energy will fall leaving the kinetic energy with less mass. Because the roller coaster is falling and the potential energy has more mass carrying the cart on the track causing more mass on the track of the rollercoaster. The roller coaster will continue to make it to the end of the ride because of how much mass the cart has and the motion of the track. The cart is heavy and the tracks will run along with the cart to keep it on track and not falling off. This energy from the track is going to transform into/onto the cart leaving the cart to follow the moving tracks, for a safe environment for riders riding that rollercoaster. And keeping it a safe environment but also a fun exciting experiment. The relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy is that they both need a force to be pushed up or down. The relationship between the initial drop and the hill height is different because the initial drop is stronger than the height of the actual hill. The energy that is transformed and the law of conservation is a pushed force pushing onto the pulled force. The total energy ends up being 1244 with the mass x height x volume all added up together creating a force.
