Hi Gonzales family, I think I've figured out the perfect kind of roller coaster you want. I've decided this through scientific trials and learning about energy.
    To start, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Height relates to potential energy and kinetic energy, because height is included in the equation for potential energy. If there is more height, there's more potential energy, because height is part of the equation for potential energy. If there's more potential energy there's more kinetic energy, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, there's going to be the same amount of total energy. Total energy is equal to the sum of potential and kinetic energy.
    As the car goes down the drop, the potential energy will be transferred to kinetic energy equally, keeping the total energy the same. If transfers because if the farther down it goes there's less height, so less potential energy, but that energy has to go somewhere. It becomes kinetic energy. Since all the energy will be the same throughout, the height of the hill must be less than the height of the initial drop, since it needs enough energy to get over the hill. If there isn't enough energy the cart won't make it over. This is shown in my hill trials, where the initial drop is 5. When the hill is 3 m high the car is able to go over it, but when the hill is 5 m high the car can't go over it.
    More mass would also be beneficial to a good roller coaster. Mass affects the total energy, and more total energy means it will go faster, making the roller coaster more fun. As you can see in my trials, when the car weighed 40 kg the total energy was 1955. When it weighed 60 kg, the total energy was 2933, proving what I just said.
    If you'd like to consult me further, I'll explain what heights of hills this points to and would be happy to give suggestions.
