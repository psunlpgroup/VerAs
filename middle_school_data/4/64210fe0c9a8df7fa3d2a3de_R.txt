Our chosen initial drop height is 5 meters because when your initial drop is taller, you have more potential energy, which will help you get to the end in a more fun, safe way.  I know that because when my simulation was at 4 meters, the PE at the top was 1564 Joules.  When I simulated a 5 meter drop, the PE at the top was 1955 Joules.  Showing that when the height goes up, so does the potential energy.  
PE and KE's relationship is that they switch gradually during a roller coaster.  For example, in a frictionless simulation, when the total energy was 1173 J, the start PE was 1173 J and the start KE was 0 J.  Within the drop, those roles were reversed and the end PE was 1 J and the end KE was 1172 J.  
In one of my simulations, the total energy was 782 J, but my PE was 0 J and my KE was 781 J.  This is an example of how energy may seem like it goes away, but due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, it can't and it just transitions into a different kind of energy.  
We wanted to have the highest possible drop height because, to make it all the way, your hills and loops have to be smaller.  For example, when our drop and hill height were 5 meters, our car didn't make it to the end and just kept going up and down the hill.  
Also, when the car has more mass, the energy goes up as well.  This was proven in our simulation when the mass was 50 kg and the TE was 2445 J and the mass was 60 kg and the TE was 2934 J.
