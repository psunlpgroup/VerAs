The energy keeps the roller coaster moving. If there is little energy the cart wont go very fast or be able to go over many hills.
An example of this is when the initial drop height was 5.00 and the hill height was 5.00 the cart did not make it to the end. The hill height always has to be less than the initial drop height, if its not the cart wont be able to go over the hill and make it to the end. 
When the cart is at the top of the initial drop and the height higher the PE will greater and the KE will be 0J because the cart is not moving. At the bottom of the drop the KE will be the PE at the beginning -1J because the PE can never be 0J. An example of this is when the drop height was 5.00 the PE at the top was 2443J, the KE at the bottom was 2442J and the PE was 1J. 
 When the car is moving down the hill the PE will get lower and the KE will get higher. This is because the car is moving and the faster the car is moving the higher the KE will be. The Law of Conservation of Energy states "energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can convert from one type to another". The KE + PE = TE . The PE and KE added together will always have to be the TE because like the Law of Conservation says that energy cannot be destroyed. An example of this is when the drop height was 2.00 the PE at the top of the drop was 977J the KE was 0. At the end of the initial drop the KeE was 976 and the PE was 1. So the KE and PE always have to add up to the TE.
When the mass is higher the TE will be higher. An example of this is when the mass was 60 kg the TE was 2937J and when the mass was 40 kg the TE was 1958J. As you move down the hill the KE will be getting greater and the PE will be getting smaller. This is because when you are going faster you will have more KE. 
So in conclusion the roller coaster depends on the KE, PE, and TE.
