Dear Gonzala family, the drop height of my roller coaster design is 5m this is because there will be more energy and if we don't have enough height the car will not make it over the hill. This is because the higher the drop the more total energy. For example when I tested the drop height of 4m the PE 2054j. When I increased the drop height to 5m, the PE increased to 2594j. The more the mass the more the energy we know this because in our data it showed that when we had our mass at 52kg the TE was 2594j but when we increased the mass to 60kg the TE increased to 2937. If we were to increase the mass of the car then it might not make it across or it might not be as fun same with the hill height. The reason why we won't go lower with the ID is that it needs to go over the hill and it will have more energy. We didn't go lower with the car mass is because it needs to stay on the track and be heavy enough we also did not go down with the hill height because the car needs to get over but it is still high enough to be fun.
