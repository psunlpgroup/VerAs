Dear, Gonzales family I would recommend that you make the initial drop bigger so then you have more PE going down, therefore, it is more fun for your riders and data shows that the bigger your initial drop the more PE and KE you have. My data shows when I had the car start at 5cm the PE was 2443 and when you started at 2 it was only 977 so starting with a bigger drop gives you more energy and it will be more fun for your riders. Height and PE are a direct relationship when ones go up the other one goes up my data shows when the height was 3m the PE was 1466 and then when we made the height 5m the PE was 2443. The total energy will stay the same throughout the whole ride no matter what either transferring through PE to KE or with friction it will have some energy transfer to thermal energy. The energy transformation and law of conservation of energy tell us that energy canÂ´t be created or destroyed so the TE will stay the same no matter what. The relationship between PE and KE is to be able to transform into each other. So at the top of the rollercoaster the car has only PE and then throughout the ride the PE transforms into KE and then it goes back and forth it is a never-ending cycle.
