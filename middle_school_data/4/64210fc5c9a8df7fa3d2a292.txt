We should start the roller coaster at 5 meters for the initial drop. The initial drop should be 5 because that is the highest it can be for the roller coaster to be fun and safe. It should be the highest possible because as the law of conservation of energy states "Energy cannot be created or destroyed." This means that if we have a initial drop of 5 meters than the hill or loop that comes after that has to be less than 5 meters due to friction (heat, and sound energy.) When the initial drop was 5 meters there was more potential energy at the top of the drop  and more kinetic energy at the bottom so that means more total energy than the smaller drops. There for from my data I can say the greater the initial drop the greater the energy. 
The best decision for the height of the hill would be 4 meters and here's why. If we made the hill 4 meters people would have the most fun and still a very safe ride. Since the hill has to be shorter than the drop it should be 1 meter below 5 meters which is 4 meters so it has the most momentum. This means that it will go for the longest and the fastest because it has the most total energy. 
The mass of the cart should be the biggest possible again 60 kg because the bigger the mass the greater the energy. Also for the mass of the cart there will be more total energy which means more kinetic energy and potential energy if the mass is the greatest it can be. Of course this is all in a friction-less scenario but in the real world there will be friction. 
The best option for the Gonzales family would be 5 meters for the initial drop, 4 meters for the hill, and finally 60 kg for the mass of the cart. This will give their passengers the best most fun experience as well as a safe ride.
