Over the last week or so we have been studying what will be the best roller coaster and we have come up with some things that have limits before there are opposite reactions.

Initial drop has to be bigger than the hill so that it can make it to the end. The potential energy should be the same because you use the same drop height.The greater the mass the bigger the total Energy. 
The lower the mass the lower the Energy.

My ride would be better than any ride. Because it starts at a drop and does a loop and goes straight and goes fast up a hill which is smaller than the drop, because then it would not make it up the hill and then you just be rocking back and forth.

 PE and KE changes when the car moves down the hill is different and depends on the car weight but it does not change that much but it does change.

I learned that the higher the roller coaster  the higher the total energy it will be. For example the 3.98 m roller coaster will have a 1946 J of energy but the 5.00 m roller coaster had 2443 so that proves the higher the roller coaster the bigger the energy and vise versa.

That mass and energy are related and can be changed from one to the other.

That concludes that there is a lot that goes into a roller coaster like how high is your drop, are there loops,are there hills and they can't be taller then the Initial drop or it wont work. I believe that my roller coaster is the best roller coaster out there please pick mine!
