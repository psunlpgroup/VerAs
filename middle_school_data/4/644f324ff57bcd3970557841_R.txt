Hello dear Gonzales family

My engineering company has worked hard to come up with a design for a safe and fun roller coaster for your theme park. The drop height of the roller coaster design is 2.75 meters and the hill height was 2.25m. Also, the car mass should be 44 Kg. 

The ID height is 2.75m. This allows enough energy for the roller coaster to make it to the end.  The amount of potential energy was 1184J.  Potential energy is the energy that is stored in the object due to where the car is located on the hill. The higher the height increases the amount of PE. For an example when I had tested the drop height of 2m, the PE was 977j. When I increased the drop height to 3.75m the pe increased to 1839j. I increased the drop height by 4.00 and the pe increased by 1715j. The amount of pe at the top of the Drop is exactly the same as the ke at the bottom of the Drop.  In addition to those two energies being the same, total energy is equal to them too. Here's my evidence. The first trial the pe was 977j.  Then the ke and total energy stayed at 977j. In the second trial, the pe was 1839j and the ke was 1839j. Total energy was also 1839J. Then for the last trial, the pe was 1973j and the ke was 1973j. The total energy is also 1973j. The pe at the top of the drop always will stay the same as the ke at the bottom of the drop.
