Rollercoaster Essay #1

	Dear the Gonzalez family



	Our construction company believes the initial drop height should be around 4.5m. We came to this height because when height goes up, energy goes up and we donÂ´t want too little or too much energy in the coaster. 

	For example, when I tested the drop height of 3m and the hill height stayed at 3m, the car did not make it over. This is because it had too much PE and not enough KE. The reason this is a problem is because the car requires KE to make it over the hill.

	The next initial drop height we tried was 3.5m. We came to the decision that we should not do this height because with enough real-world-friction, the car did not make it over the hill.

	Another height we considered was 4m. We scrapped this height for the same reason we scrapped 3.5m. Without any friction, it made it over without any problem, but with real-world-friction, it did not make it over the hill.

	The fourth and final height we tested was 4.5m, which was ultimately what we chose for the coaster. We came to this height because the cart made it over with enough PE to make it over another hill, which the other heights failed to do.
