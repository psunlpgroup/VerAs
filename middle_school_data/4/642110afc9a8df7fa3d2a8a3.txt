I think that the height of the initial drop should be 3.5 or 4 because that has been the most successful trial.the data shows that there is a direct relationship between the drop and PE because the PE goes up as the height goes up.There is a indirect relationship between the KE the KE goes down as the height goes up.Going down the drop the PE goes down but the K goes up.The mass of the car should be 50 because that is not too low or too high because that has shown that it does the best 60 is too high and 40  is too low.The hill height should be between 3-4 because it works the best when the drop height is a little bit biger than the hill so the car can use the law of conservation of energy.Also the car can accerlerate up the hill and drop.The more mass there is the more energy.the relationship between drop height and the hill height is that the drop has to be bigger or the same height as the hill otherwise the car will not make it over the hill
