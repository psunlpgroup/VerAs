I believe the initial drop should be higher than the hill so that it can get over the hill successfully. This is because potential energy is directly related to height and so the more height the more potential energy the coaster will have. I know that the hill must be shorter because if it is higher or the same height the cart will not have enough energy to pass over it. This is because if the hill was higher it would require more energy to get over and as the law of conservation of mass states, mass cannot be created or destroyed. With this being said the higher the initial drop the more total energy the cart will have, and therefore the more kinetic energy at the bottom and potential energy at the top. This is because the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy always equals the total energy. The total energy is how much energy the cart has in total and always stays the same unless a factor is changed like height. This effects the ride because we need more total energy to go over and through parts of the ride. The Total energy is also effected by the mass of the cart, the more mass the cart has the more total energy it has as well. When the cart travels downwards its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. This is once again because, as the law of conservation of mass states, mass cannot be created or destroyed.
