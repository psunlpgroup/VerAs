I would start with a height of 5 meters and i would want to have total energy of 1955 because it would be the fastest because the car would be the heaviest the energy would end up 1 potential energy and 1954 kinetic energy. The energy changes from kinetic to potential. when it goes down the drop and come to a stop     the higher the drop hill is the more the drop will effect the total energy because the way it changes from kinetic to potential. The realationship between mass and kinetic energy is when the mass goes up the kinetic energy goes up and with potential it goes down.
