The first item is when the initial drop is taller, the car will have more potential energy at the top and more potential energy. This means the car will have more kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. The energy will shift throughout the drop from potential to kinetic. The reason the energy transfers is because of the Conservation of Energy, which states that energy can't be created or destroyed. So there will always be the same amount of total energy throughout the ride. We also know the potential and kinetic energy equals the total energy. The drop height has to be taller than the hill height or else the car will not make it up the hill because potential energy depends on height. The larger the mass of the car is the more potential can kinetic energy there will be.
