 Hello Gonzales family! I'm mailing you my essay about how my roller coaster would be the most popular attraction and how it would run flawlessly without any problems with it's design. 

 First it has a fast initial drop ,at 5m, down into a tunnel then in slowly climes a hill, gaining 2937 PE to make it over a 2.5m hill. Once it drops converting it all into 2933 KE and allowing it to make it over the hill and into a drop. With a inversion and then slowing down into a flat area keeping the total energy the same because all the PE turned into KE when it went down the initial drop. 
 The cart will be 60Kg because through out my research that's the weight that gave me the most PE(2937) and KE(2933) energy in all my simulations.  Like in my first simulation 50 kg and 5m initial drop, it only had 2448 PE and 2444 KE at the end of the initial drop. Showing that 60 kg is the best weight to use
 And the reason why the initial drop is double the size of the hill is because if the the PE on top of the hill is the same as the PE on the top of the initial drop then it won't go over. Like in one of my experiments where the hill and initial drop were both 5m and they coaster didn't make it over the hill, making in roll back and fourth. The flat area also shows that the total energy is 2933 which is just all the PE and KE connected. Another reason why I chose this coaster is because it had the most total energy in all my simulations, the closest one was at 2448 which is a good distance away from the best one.
 And all energy in this model is just PE and KE converting into each other once they go down a drop or up a hill. 
 And that Gonzales family is why I know my roller coaster will out preform and work better than any other roller coaster you might see.
