After I have gone through the experemnts, I have found what works best for the perfect roller coaster that makes the ride safe and enjoyable.

Starting off with the drop of the roller coaster, the inital drop will be 5 meters high and, I choose this because this is the highest im able to make it go. I also believe that this is the best choice for the coaster because with the highest will drop on the coaster will give lots of PE. it starts to have lots of energy and gets KE when going down and thermal energy starts to hit becaus eof the heat againts the tracks and car.

The hill is 4.5 meters high because the hill is still high to gain energy going up but is still able to make it up the hill, the speed of the inital drop makes the the . Once you get to the hill, the PE starts to balance up and KE goes down and total energy hits. Then you go down the hill rapedly fast to a finsh and the energy turns into Laws of Conservation of Energy because the speed stays the same.

Lastly with the cart, I have the mass as 57.5 because the more mass you have the faster you will accelorate forward. I wanted the mass to be heavy but still leave room for the mass to not be at the maximum so it can make it over the hills. With the mass being heavy the inital drop will go faster down the hill it will acelorate up the hill and go rapidlly fast down the hill ending with a fast finsh to end the roller coaster.

Thankyou for your time reading my perspective of a perfect roller coaster.
