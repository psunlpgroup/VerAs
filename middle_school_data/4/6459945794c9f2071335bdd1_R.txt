I would tell the Gonzales family to have the initial drop at 4.00 m. Because the drop is at 4.00 m the hill height can be either 4.00 m or anything under that because of the drop. Regarding the mass of the cart, I would say to have it at 55kg because you have more PE at the top of the hill. Once you go the KE at the bottom of the drop is the same number as the PE at the top of the drop. Because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states energy can not be created nor destroyed, the energy gets transferred as you go down the drop. In one of my trials, the initial drop height was 4.00 the TE was 1955, the TE of the hill height was 1959 and my car made it. The mass of my cart was 40 kg. So you should make your initial drop at 4.00 m. Your hill height should be at 3.69. And the mass of your cart should be about 40 kg. The more mass the more energy your cart will have. And the more height you have your drop and hill the more the total energy will be. The total energy is made up by adding your PE and KE. The higher your initial drop height is the more PE you will have at the top of the drop.
