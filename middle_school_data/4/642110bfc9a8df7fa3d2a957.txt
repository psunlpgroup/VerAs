I've been working on you roller coaster and so far I think you should have 5 meter drop height so that your coaster can have maximum energy going through. The reason I say this is because in my experiments I found that the higher the drop the more PE we would have at the top and the KE and TE we would have at the bottom.  I also think we should have a 5 meter initial drop is because of the conservation of energy. It states that energy can not be created or destroyed meaning that the hills and loops have to be smaller than the initial drop in order to have enough energy to get past everything and get to the end. Then after our initial drop we should have a hill that is 4.75 meters high because in my trails I found that the hill just has to be smaller that the initial drop for the coaster to get over but with the 4.75 meter hill we can get an increase of energy going down the hill to later use for the rest of the track. Finally I think we should have the mass of our car be 60 kg because my experiments showed that the more mass the car has the more PE and KE it gets from the drops.
