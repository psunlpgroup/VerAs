Hi Mr. Gonzales, my team and I have made a roller coaster to be the best. This is the science behind the roller coaster and how it works The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the more height our coaster track has the more energy it has. For example, 5 meters will have more PE than an 3.5 initial drop.For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 2,199 joules. when I increased it the drop height to 5 meters the PE increased at 2443.  

Our total energy has been the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop. For a car with 40kg as its mass it had a PE of 1,959 Joules and A car with 50kg of mass had  a PE of 2,448 Joules. This shows that a car with more mass has a higher KE and PE than one with less. Total energy should always be the same and PE. 

The Law of Conservation of Energy states,  “Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but…it can convert from one type of energy to another”. So PE and KE are always transferring back and forth. Also, the drop height has to be higher than the hill height because if the drop height it 4 and the hill height is 5 the car will get stuck at the top or wont be able to go over the hill. Thank you for your time.
