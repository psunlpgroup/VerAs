The science behind our roller coaster that will make it exciting is that the mass will be 70 kg and it will be heavy which mean the heavier the roller coaster the faster it goes which will make it fun and safe and we will have stoppers to slow it down. and our roller coaster will be the best for the gonzalez family and here our some of the trials from my data the mass is 70 kg and the pe energy is 1529 and the ke energy is 1588 and the total energy 3117 and it will make the ride fast safe and fun.  the more pe there is the more likely it is to go faster because pe goes into the ke and it will combine  to go faster. when the cart goes down the hill the pe goes into the ke.


The Law Of Conservation of energy. energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can convert from one type of energy to another.  energy=1/2 x mass x velocity2 (ke= 1/2 mv2
