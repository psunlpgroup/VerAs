I think the should use the highest intial drop of 5 meters and 4 meters for the hill height. I also think they should use a higher number for the car mass like 60. The 5 meter start height will give the car enough energy to not only finish but also do it faster than it would if it were shorter, the car mass being 60 will also ad more velosity and make the ride more exciting. the hill height being 4 meters will also add more excitment while also being shorter than the intial drop allowing the car to make it the whole ride. In all of the expriiments we did the drop height increasing increased the potential energy and the same with the car mass.
