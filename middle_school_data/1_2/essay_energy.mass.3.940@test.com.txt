1. The initial drop height should be 3 meters because it won't produce that much energy but it will produce enough to make the ride enjoyable.
2. If you have a higher drop height the more energy you will have.
3. The height relates to PE at the top because when I started with an initial drop of 3 meters the PE was 1759 joules.
4. As roller coaster went down, the KE went up.
5. PE and KE have a indirect relationship.
6. At the top of the initial drop with 3 meters I had 1759 joules of PE and 0 joules of KE.
7. As the roller coaster went down I only had 1 joule of PE and 1173 joules of KE.
8. My total energy was 1173 joules.
9. This shows that the PE at the top and KE at the bottom equal the total energy.
10. The Law of Conservation of Energy states energy cannot be created or destroyed.
11. For example if I started off at the top of the rollercoaster with 100 joules of PE, halfway down the rollercoasater I would have 50 joules of PE and 50 joules of KE and at the end of the rollercoaster I would have 100 joules of just KE.
12. No energy was being created or destroyed the energy just transferred into a different form.
13. The more mass you have, the more energy you will have too.
14. My car mass was 40 kg and my total energy released was 1957 joules.
15. Then I changed my car mass to 60 kg and my total energy released was 2446 joules.
