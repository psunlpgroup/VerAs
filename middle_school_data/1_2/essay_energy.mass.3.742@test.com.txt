1. The height of the drop relates to PE at the top because they have a direct relationship, the larger the height the bigger the PE.
2. Also, KE and height have a direct relationship so when the car is at the bottom the KE will be bigger if the drop height is bigger.
3. In my simulation when the drop height was 4 the PE was 2267 Joules and the KE was 2266, but when the drop height was 5 the PE was 2834 joules and the KE was 2833.
4. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is when the Car is at the top of the initial drop the PE is always the same as the total energy and the KE is always 0.
5. When the car is at the bottom of the drop the KE is the amount of the total energy if there is no friction, but if there is some of the energy gets turned into nonusable energy and KE is less than the starting total energy.
6. When the car is at the bottom the PE is always 0.
7. The changes in PE and KE going down the drop is when the car starts accelerating it changes from PE to KE.
8. The energy from PE doesn't get destroyed it gets converted into KE.
9. That's why at the top of the drop the PE is the total energy and the KE is 0 and at the bottom of the drop the PE is 0 and the KE is the total energy or total energy that is usable.
10. Energy transformation happens when the PE converts to KE this is because The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.
11. So when the car goes down the hill the energy changes from PE to KE.
12. The relationship between the drop height in hill height is that the initial drop has to be higher than the hill.
13. In the simulation, I found that when I had both the initial drop and hill height at 5 the KE was only 29 joules at the top of the hill and it wasn't enough to make it over.
14. But when the hill height was 4 and the drop height was 5 the KE was 559 at the top of the hill and was able to make it over.
15. This shows the hill height must be less than the initial drop.
16. The relationship between mass PE and KE is when the Mass is more the total energy is more.
17. In the simulation, I found that when the car mass was 50 the PE at the top of the hill ( total energy ) was only 2449 Joules and the KE at the bottom was 2444 joules.
18. But when the mass was 60 the PE at the top of the hill was 2938 Joules and the KE at the bottom of the hill was 2895 joules.
19. This shows that mass and energy have a direct relationship.
