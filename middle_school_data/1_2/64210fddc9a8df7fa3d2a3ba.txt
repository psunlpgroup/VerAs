The drop height of my roller coster is going to be 5 meters. This is because the more height the car has the more potential energy. For example, when my drop height was 2 meters the potential energy was 977 joules. When I increased the drop height to 3 meters the potential energy increased 489 joules. When the car got to the bottom of the drop, the kinetic energy was greater the more height it had at the begining. 
Kinetic energy and Potential energy add up to the total amount of energy. The conservation of energy law states that energy cannot be created or distroyed. At the top of drop the potential energy has the total amount of energy, but as the car goes down the drop it tranfers into kinetic energy. Once it is at the very bottom, potential energy has 0 joules and kinetic energy has the total amount because kinetic energy is involved with velocity.
Potential energy is based on three things, one of them is height. The greater the height the more potential energy. When the car starts 3 meters tall the potenial energy is 1466 joules. If you put a hill that is 4 meters tall then there will simply not be enough to get over the hill. The energy can't be created or distroyed, the car only has enough to get up 3 meters. Also the more mass the car has the more energy because potential energy is height x mass x gravity. The greater the mass the greater the energy.
My roller coster will have an initial drop of 5 meters and will have a hill right after that is only 2 meters high. The car will make if over easily expecially because the mass is 50 kg. After the hill the car will be able to go farther will hills, loops, ect. So it is really fin and fast but it is still safe.
