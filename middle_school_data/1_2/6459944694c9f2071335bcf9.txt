Dear, the Gonzales Family 
I have been doing a lot of research on roller coasters. I believe that my idea would be a great addition to your park, attract a lot more people to come to your park. 
       The first thing is height everyone is looking for a tall, fast, stomach-dropping ride. I came up with is the ride will have a 4.05(m) release height. At the top of the release drop the PE will be at 1585(J) and the KE will be at 0(J). At the bottom of the release drop now the PE is at 1(J) and the KE is at 1584(J). 
       The total energy changes from PE to KE, Many times throughout the ride. This makes it speed it and slow down
 
  
sorry i didn't finish it completely slipped my mind
