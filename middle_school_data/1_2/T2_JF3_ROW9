Roller coasters are full of fun and excitement but it is not that simple to make, there are lots of components when it comes to making roller coasters.
First is you need a big drop, and the big drop will have lots of potential energy if the drop is high enough.
And if the mass of the cart is heavier then there will be more potential energy, so if the car is kg it will have joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, than a car that weighs kg will have joules of potential energy at the top of the drop.
Now as the car goes down the drop the potential energy will start to convert to KE, but the total energy will not change because energy cannot be created nor destroyed.
Now we have to add a hill to the ride, but the hill cannot be higher or the same as the initial drop otherwise the car will not make it over the hill.
For example, when the drop was .
meters high and the hill was also .
meters, the car did not make it over the hill.
But when the hill was .
meters high the car successfully made it over the hill.
Finally, the Gonzales family should have a high drop and a hill that is no higher than the drop so the roller coaster can be fun and successful.
