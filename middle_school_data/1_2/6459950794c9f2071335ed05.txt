dear Gonzales family
I think you should have a high hill the highest you can. cause it has more potential energy at the top. And a lot of ke at the bottom and more total energy in my studies the tallest was the best. and if you did it too small there would be no speed no energy it would not be fun. in the middle height, you just won't have enough energy as the highest one. if you are going to add a hill do it 3/4 up cause it has more pe energy and ke and you can't do it too high cause then it will just go back down the hill. if you do it too small it just won't have as much energy. for the weight of the cart. you want to make it as heavy as you can cause that has the most energy pe and ke and total that will bring you the most. the smaller it is the least the energy the bigger it is the more the energy. pe is energy that turns into ke and it will make the cart go faster. than if it had a lower ke.
