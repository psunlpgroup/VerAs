If I were to design a roller coaster for the Gonzales theme park, i tell them the height of the initial drop must be higher than the hill that comes after it because if is not, the amount of total energy would be the same for both hills and with all the Potential energy, it still wouldn't be enough to get to the top of the hill. The relationship between kinetic energy and potential energy is at the top of a hill there will be more potential energy than Kinetic but as the car moves down the track the Potential energy and Kinetic Energy flip and at the bottom of the hill is where the Kinetic energy will be more than the potential energy. So if the hills were the same height it wouldn't have enough total energy to get to the top of the second hill, which is why the initial hill should always be higher than the additional hill. 
I would start with a higher initial hill so the higher it is the more total energy it will have and then it will go faster and be able to clear the additional hill in front of it.
