There are certain factors to consider, the mass of the cart and the height of the drop and hill. The cart should be dropped from the highest height with a smaller hill. The higher the drop the more potential energy it will have, if the height of the hill was the same as the drop it would not have enough energy to make it up the hill. For example, In our data the initial drop had been at 5 and in the first trial and the hill at 2. It made it to the end and the kinetic energy at the top of the hill had been 1173 J. At the last trial the hill had been the same height as the drop, it only had 7 J of kinetic energy and did not make it to the end. The total energy will always be the same as the potential energy at the top of the drop giving it a higher total energy. Therefore the hill needs to be a bit less than the height of the drop, so it is still able to keep going if needed making it a more exciting ride. Mass of the cart is also very important. Depending on the ride the mass of the cart should be somewhere in the middle rather than lower or higher. In our first trial the mass was at 40 kg and the potential energy was at 1956 J, this gave it around the same kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop because energies cannot be completely eliminated only transfered. At 60 kg it had 2934 J at the top of the initial drop. In the middle, 50 kg would be perfect for a fun ride if loops and hills are the final goal design. It will have just enough energy to make it to the end of the ride. These are the current suggestions I have provided for the roller coaster that is desired.
