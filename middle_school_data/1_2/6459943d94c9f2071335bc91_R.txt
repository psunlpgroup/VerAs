Greetings Gonzales family as you know I have made a design for your roller coaster. I think the initial drop height should be 5 m, then have a hill that is 4 m tall, then a loop 4 m tall, and at the end a hill 3 m tall.  And the car  mass should be  60 kg.  In this essay I will explain why I made my design like this.
You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster so I made the drop height 5 m.  You said you wanted an exciting ride so I put the drop height as 5 m.  Because it was the highest it could be and it had the most energy.  For example when I had a drop height of 2.5 the PE at the top was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.  At the bottom the KE was 1221 J and the PE was 1 J.  It had a total energy of 1222 J.  But when I had a drop height of 5 m the PE at the top was 2443 J and the KE was 0 J.  At the bottom the KE was 2442 J and the PE was 1 J.  And it had a total energy of 2443.  So the 5 m tall drop had 1221 J of energy more than the 2.5 m tall drop.  
Then there will be a hill of 4 m.  The reason I have the hill as 4 m is because a hill has to be shorter than initial drop height because otherwise there won't be enough energy to go over the hill.  For example when I did an Initial Drop height of 5 m and had a hill height of 5 m it didn't go over the hill because it did not have enough energy.  Because at the initial drop the PE was 2450 J and the KE was 0 J.  But then at the top of the hill or close to the top of the hill the PE was 2449 J and the KE was 1 J.  And because of this it wasn't able to go over the hill because it didn't have enough energy.  But when the hill height was 4 it was able to go over.  Because at the initial drop the PE was 2448 J and the KE was 0 J.  Then at the top of the hill the PE was 1959 J and the KE was 489 J and had enough energy to go up the hill.  
The amount of total energy depends on how much PE and KE there is.  Because PE and KE added together equals the total amount of energy.  And the initial drop affects the amount of PE because the higher the drop height the larger amount of PE there is.  And the more PE there is at the top the more KE there is at the bottom of the drop.  This is  because all the PE from the top transfers to KE.  This happens because the Law of Conservation of Energy which means that energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be transferred.  So since the total amount of energy is the PE and KE combined the total energy never changes because the energy is only transferred.  For example when I had a drop height of 2.5 m the PE at the top of the drop was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.  At the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1221 J and the total energy was 1222 J.  When I had a drop height of 5 m the PE at the top was 2443 J and the KE was 0 J.  Then at the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1442 J and the total energy was 1443 J.  
Then there will be a loop and the reason it is 4 m is the same reason as the hill.  The same rules apply,  it has to be shorter than the initial drop so it can make it over and to the end.  Then I have a hill of 3 m to end it off.
The car should be 60 kg.  Because the larger the mass the more energy.  For example when the car mass was 40 kg the total energy was 1985 J.  But when the car mass was 2937.
All of this is why you should choose my design for an initial drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 4 m.  Thank you for your time.
