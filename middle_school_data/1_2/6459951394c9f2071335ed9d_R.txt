Dear Gonzales family, 

I believe it's in your best interest for your initial drop height to be higher than your first hill, in my research 5m resulted in the best chance of making it over the first hill while 2m had the lowest chance of making it over the first hill, along with it being boring, it just doesn't work. The roller coaster will not have enough potential energy to make It over the hill if it is higher than the initial drop height. The higher the PE at the top of the initial drop, the higher the KE at the bottom. The reason for this is that energy cannot be created, so if your drop height is low, the ride isn't going to have enough PE and KE through for it to be exciting. 

The reason why I explain PE and KE is that these two things create the total number of energy. For example, in my research, I found that the higher PE let's say the initial PE is 2443 and the initial KE is 0. At the top of the hill, the PE will only be 833, and the KE will rise to 1611. The reason for this is most of the PE was used up on the initial drop and no KE was used. However, at the top of the hill, the KE is used because of the drop changing the PE to KE. 

I also recommend a heavy cart. My reasoning for this is that the cart will go faster down the hill, resulting in a higher speed and more excitement for riders. For example in my trials, 60kg resulted in the highest amount of total energy at the end, while 40kg resulted in the lowest amount of total energy in other words, less speed. 

I hope you will consider my advice. Best wishes, your roller coaster designer.
