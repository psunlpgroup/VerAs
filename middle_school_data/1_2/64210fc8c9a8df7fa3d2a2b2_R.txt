Dear Mr and Mrs Gonzales, our design team has been working hard for your roller coaster and we came to a consensus about the design, the height of the initial drop will be 4.5 Meters witch in our tests had a total of 2410 Jewl's of PE witch changes into KE at the bottom of the drop. 

in our ride we want as much PE as we can have without being dangerous because the more PE the more speed/velocity witch makes fun the PE transfers to KE throughout the ride but the TE always stays the same.

 when the car is going down the hill the PE is rapidly changing into KE and on top of the hill most of the TE is PE. 

the law of energy states that energy cannot be made or destroyed only changed so when energy changes it turn into a different energy witch could be potential energy or  kinetic energy or heat or light energy etc but it changes.

the initial drop height has to be higher than the hill so the car can move over it, also mass changes how much energy their is because the more mass the more PE witch turns into KE mass is also in the equation for velocity.
