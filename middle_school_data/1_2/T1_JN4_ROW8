What I recommend for the Gonzales family to be able to have the best roller coaster would be having the height of the drop be high.
When my simulation had the drop height of m it gave me the most PE and KE out of my trials.
If you were to compare my first trial to my last it would be m high with the PE of the initial drop being J and for my last trial, it would be m high with the PE at the top of the initial drop being J.
The higher the height of the drop the more PE there will be at the top and the more KE there will be at the bottom, so I recommend making the drop height high enough so it can release enough PE to make it to the end of the coaster.
PE and KE relationship relies on the amount of energy that is given.
If you have a J of PE at the top of the hill then that same amount of energy would transfer to the KE at the bottom of the hill.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can change, this has to do with the PE and KE because the amount of PE that you have when you go down a hill transfers over to the KE at the bottom so no energy is gained or lost as the car goes down the hill.
The more mass a car has the more PE and total energy it is going to have.
When I compared the mass of a kg car the PE was J at the top and at the bottom, the KE was J, but when my car had a mass of kg the PE was J at the top and the KE at the bottom was J.
So the more mass the car has the more potential energy it will start with and the more kinetic energy it will end with.
So for the Gonzales family to have the best roller coaster they need to include a high drop height in order to build up all that potential and kinetic energy so that the roller coaster makes it through the turns and to the end.
