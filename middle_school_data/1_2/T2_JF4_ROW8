My roller coaster called Scream attracts people of all ages.
Scream is a ride that is safe but fun at the same time, Scream is a roller coaster that is well thought out and makes a lot of sense in building, and let me tell you why.
The cart in my roller coaster holds kg, the more mass that you fir in the car the more potential and kinetic energy that you will have so having kg will create a high amount of potential and kinetic energy.
which equals out two grown adults.
You first start out going straight forward smoothly while you are feet in the air.
You start to creep over the edge and see a huge drop you then start flying down and the potential energy you had before is now turning into kinetic you're going so fast you can barely tell where you are.
All of a sudden you go up into a loop and away this is safe is that you have the over the shoulder seat belts so that you won't fall out of the cart and the loop is smaller than the initial drop so there is no reason for getting stuck upside down while you are in it.
After you make your way around the loop you then get to the next hill from the loop you have slowed down and then start slowly going up the hill you then are making your way to the top and then you shift gears and start going full speed down the loop is about feet in the air so you are high up but not too high up while then you get to the bottom you start to slow down but no worries the ride isn't over yet, you start to have a little jerk of speed and go up a really small hill but its only feet in the air.
Then you start to slow down and come down to a flat surface which then the potential energy that you had at the top then transfers to the kinetic energy and the joules you had at the top are now all transferred to the bottom you now have, and you didn't even realize the ride was over cause you couldn't stop screaming.
