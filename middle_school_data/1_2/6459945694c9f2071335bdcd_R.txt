during my proposal to the Gonzales family. If increase the initial drop height, the total energy will increase too. The potential energy converts into kinetic energy as the car goes down the hill. Also, for example, when testing the drop height of  3.68 meters the pe was 1979 but when I increased the drop height to 4.45 meters the pe was increased at 2391 joules. Also, The total energy of a system, including a roller coaster, is the sum of its potential and kinetic energies. It represents the overall energy content of the system at any given point during the ride. The law of conservation of energy principle ensures that the total energy of the roller coaster remains constant throughout the ride, neglecting any energy losses due to friction or other external factors. This means you cannot create or get rid of energy. The total energy will stay the same throughout the ride when there is no friction. Also, the drop height of my roller coaster design is  4.45 meters this is important because it makes the roller coaster fast and goes up the hills and making it fun and not a boring ride. The more mass the car has, the more energy the car will have. This will make it fun and make it to the end.
