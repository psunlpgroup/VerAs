Hello, Gonzales family I have a roller coaster proposal for you guys I want to bring my amazing Ride of terror to your amusement park so here is why it is a good idea.
First, the ride is obviously terrifying but it is a ride where you have no time to think about anything it is what it sounds like terrifying so it will bring a lot of fun, and in the end, people might want to go again!
But to get into some data we found that if the cart is kg then the KE will be around at the bottom of the drop, so if we do sharp twists and turns then you will gain KE preventing the cart from stopping in the middle of the track.
We found that every kg added to the cart's mass then it gains around more KE.
We wouldn't want it to stop in the middle of the track so that helps it from doing so.
The changes of going down the drop between KE and PE would be gaining the KE and the PE would be making it through the whole ride gaining the PE and KE preventing stops or loss of speed throughout, we are trying to calculate the total mass that the cart can hold without stops or speed loss which we are testing with heavy mannequins increasing the mass and seeing if the speed continues to go down or rise calculating the mass that the cart's capacity.
The drop and hill heights will first be a huge drop at the start getting a lot of suspensions but then there will be a loop and after hills and drops getting gradually smaller and smaller preventing the cart from losing the speed we need it at, we will make many drops and hills but all throughout they will get smaller and smaller.
I hope you at least think about the proposal and I think this will be a big start for your amusement park's popularity!
Hope you think about the proposal!
