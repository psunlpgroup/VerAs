Dear Gonzales family, we found that the best ID is 3.57m because it is fun and its max speed is 8.4m/s which is just below the safety limit so we can't go higher and it will be at its max speed and it will be safe. The mass should be 56kg because the more the mass the more the PE and if there is more PE it will be more likely to make it over. The hill height should be 2.5 because the KE increases also it will be more likely to make it over.
