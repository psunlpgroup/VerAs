The initial drop of my roller coaster is 3.5 m the loop is 2m and the last hill is 0.7m. The mass of our car is 50 kg. I choose these heights because the roller coaster cannot go over 8.4m/s. All of these heights will not go faster than 8.4 m/s. For my data when the initial drop height was 3.5 meters the speed was 8.16m/s. If the initial drop height was larger the speed would be too fast. The mass of the car was 50 kg because you want the most people to get on the roller coaster. Mass and Speed have no relationship when the mass of the car was 40 kg the Speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 m/s. When the mass of the car was 60 kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 m/s. When you have more height your PE increases and KE increases. So does your total energy this is a direct relationship. When the PE and KE increase so does your Total Energy because of PE+KE=TE. With more height, you have more velocity. With more velocity, you have more speed. Mass also has a direct relationship between PE and KE. When mass goes up so do PE and KE. Mass does not impact the speed of the roller coaster. PE KE and TE all have direct relationships. The more PE you have the more KE you have. This affects the roller coaster because having too much PE or KE can make the roller coaster unsafe. Having too little can make the roller coaster not fun. The law of conservation of energy affected design decisions because some energy will be transferred into different energy if the hill is a tiny bit smaller than the initial drop height the roller coaster will not make it. Height and PE have a direct relationship because when Height goes up so does PE
