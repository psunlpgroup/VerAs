Hello, I am your lead researcher for the roller coaster project. Here are the decisions my team and I have made. We chose a 3.5-meter initial drop because it will make the car go at the fastest speed without the roller coaster being dangerous. In our testing, our results show when the initial drop is 3.5 meters tall the maximum speed is 8.27 m/s, this is just under the lethal limit. When the drop height is increased to 4 meters the maximum speed was 8.83 m/s, this is over the lethal limit. We suggest a mass of 60kg for the car mass because it will give the car the maximum amount of energy. Our research shows when the initial drop is 4 meters and the car mass is 40kg the TE was 1564J. When the mass was increased to 58kg the TE increased to 2267J. We also considered how the height and mass impact the PE, KE, TE, and speed of the rollercoaster car. When the height increases the PE, KE, TE, and speed of the car increase. When the mass of the car increases the PE, KE, and TE also increase, but we found no relation between the mass of the car and the speed of the car. The conservation of mass affected the way we designed our rollercoaster. We chose to have each loop/hill gradually decrease in height throughout the ride. We chose to do this because some of the PE at the beginning of the ride will turn into thermal energy and take away energy from the car, slowing it down.
