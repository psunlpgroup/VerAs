I have observed that the mass does not affect speed, so I would recommend having the car be 60 kilograms. I would then suggest that the roller coaster have a 3.5-meter high initial drop which would increase speed and potential energy. I have learned that potential energy is stored energy, but when the object goes into motion, the potential energy becomes kinetic energy. The potential energy at the beginning of the ride would be 1,470 joules, which would transfer to kinetic energy as the car goes into motion. If you add up the potential and kinetic energy you find the total energy of the roller coaster. 
The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed. The speed, caused by gravity pulling the car down the drop, would be 8.27 meters per second at the bottom of the initial drop. This also ensures that the ride will be fast but not dangerous. 
The hill would be around 2.5 meters high, this is lower than the initial drop height so that there is enough speed and energy to continue until the end. The speed at the top of the hill would be 4.4 meters per second. This has enough speed to keep the object in motion until it begins to drop, where it would then gain speed. At the end of the hill, the speed would be around 8.27 meters per second. It would be possible to add a small loop if wanted because there is enough velocity and kinetic energy.
