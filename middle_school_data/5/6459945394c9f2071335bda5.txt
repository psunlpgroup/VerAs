My coaster is the best choice for the Gonzales family because it meets all the expectations and safety hazards. First off my coaster does not go over the speed of 8.4 mps its max speed is 8.30 mps.
The initial drop of my coaster is 3.52 meters tall because the higher the initial drop the higher the top speed
since the coaster is at a speed of 8.30 its not too fast were people will get hurt but just fast enough were it is scary enough. The initial drop has to be higher than another peak on the coaster that is why the hill is 3.0 and the drop is 3.52 other wise it wouldn't be able to make it up the hill and finish the coaster. 

The mass of the roller coaster car raises the total energy of the car going down the coaster however the mass does not effect the speed of the coaster the initial drop height changes the speed.
The relationship between PE and KE is when the car is not moving and or at the top of a hill or peak the potential energy is higher than KE but when the coaster is moving and going down the PE transfers to KE.
Total energy is KE+PE and lets say that equals 1724 J that energy would be transferring back and fourth through PE and KE because of hills and drops. 
in conclusion i believe my coaster is the best choice for the Gonzales family because it doesn't go above 8.4 Mps and carry's enough.My coaster is fast enough were it will let people have a fun time but no injure anyone.
