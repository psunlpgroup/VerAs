Our coaster is the best because of the speed of the coaster. at the initial drop of the coaster is 5m and the coaster weights 60 KG so you start with about 2932J of PE but that energy will soon transfer to KE. Going down the hill you build up lots of KE at about 2932J. Then the coaster will use that kinetic energy to get up the second hill at the very top. Some of the kinetic energy will shift to PE but then going down again will turn all the energy to kinetic. As you come down the second hill your speed will clock in at about 9.89 MPH the you go through the loop the loop. Coming down to a screeching halt at the end of the ride. This is one of the fastest rides in america through the hills and the loop the loop and those are the reasons why you should pick our coaster
