Our design will have a 6m drop and a 3m hill height for an optimal mix of safety and fun. The reasoning behind the height being 6m is the more height the more PE and that leads to a higher KE and total energy. Evidence of this is shown in our simulations where  on a 5m drop there was a speed of 9.88m/s where on a 6m drop there was a speed 9.89 m/s of  Same leaning with the hill however we didnt make it 5m for the reasoning it wouldnt be able to make it up the hill. and to the fact of the shorter the hill the more fast you will go once over it making it more fun. Mass is irrelevant to speed but can lead to a higher PE and KE  which is why we are going with 60Kg. Pe and Ke are so important are because they go hand in hand as potential energy is the energy stored in an object and Kinetic energy is that energy expelled while its in motion this is called the transfer of energy. This is due to the law of conservation of energy which is no energy can be created nor destroyed however can be transferred into different types.
