We chose 50kg for our mass because it's not too light & not too heavy. We got data and found that no matter the mass, it won't affect speed but it will affect the PE and KE (and TE). The more mass you add, the more PE there will be at the top, and the more KE there will be at the bottom.
We put the drop height at 3.6 because the drop height however will affect the speed. The max speed is 8.40 but after some trials we found when we set the drop height to 3.60 the speed was 8.39 just making it safe and fun. Just like the mass, the more height you add the more TE. We put the initial drop height as high as it could go because when we add the loops and hills we will have to make them smaller then the drop height so that they can make it over/ around.
