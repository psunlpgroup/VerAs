Dear Gonzales family,
           I believe you guys should use my design for your roller coaster, because it has some befits to it like, safety and speed,  your initial drop should be 3.33, and hill height should be 3 meters. This is important because the initial height has to be higher than the hill height. Another interesting thing I found out about speed is that no matter what the mass is the speed will stay the same, so no matter how heavy the car is the speed will stay the same. Here are two examples  a mass of  car of 50kg had the speed of 7.96j, and a car mass of 55kg had the speed of 7.95j. The hill height needs to be lower than the initial drop for it to be successful over a hill, for example when the hill height is 5 meters the PE energy was 2445j, When it was 4 PE energy was 2448j. Something I learned about drop height and speed is that the initial drop height effects the speed so the higher you make the drop height the faster your cart will move, for example when the drop height is 5 meters the speed will be 9.89j, and when the drop height as 3 meters the speed was 7.67j. One last thing you should know is energy can not be created or destroyed. I hope you take my ideas into consideration and build a fun and safe roller coaster.
