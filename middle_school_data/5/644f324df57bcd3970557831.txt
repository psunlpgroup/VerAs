Dear Gonzales family, I have created measurements for a rollercoaster so they can be fun and safe as well.
      The drop height of my roller coaster design is 3.35 meters. This is because as you increase the height, the PE, KE, and TE increase as well. For example in trial 1, When the initial drop height was 2.75m the PE at the top, KE at the bottom, and TE were all 1342j and in trial 2 when the height was increased to 3.35m the PE at the top, KE at the bottom, and TE also increased to 1638j. Also in trial 3, when the height was 4m, the PE at the top, KE at the bottom, and TE were 1955j and in trial 4 when the height was increased to 4.5m the PE at the top, KE at the bottom, and TE increased to 2199j. This data shows that when the height is increased the PE, KE, and TE increase. The law of conservation of energy states that Energy cannot be created nor destroyed. This means that as the car goes down the drop, the PE decreases because it is changing into KE ( since PE is energy in rest and KE is energy in motion ). So since when you increase the height you increase the energy, you can’t put your height too high because then it won’t be safe enough, that is why I chose 3.35m.  

       The PE and the height have a direct relationship because The PE depends on the height of the drop. In other words, as you increase or decrease the height of the drop you are increasing the PE ( at the top of it ).  For example in trial 1, when the height was 2m, the PE at the top of it was 977j and in trial 2 when the height was increased to 2.75m the PE increased to 1342j. Another example was in trial 3 when the height was 3.35m, the PE was 1638j and in trial 4 when the height was increased to 4m the PE increased 1955j. This data shows that as you change the height of the drop you affect the PE as well.
      
     The hill height for the rollercoaster I chose was 2.75m. I chose this because the hill height cannot be higher than the drop height because then the car won’t make it to the end. This is because the initial drop height chooses the total energy. If the hill height is too high then there will not be enough total energy for the cart to go over. For example, ( when we didn’t change the initial drop height)  the hill height was 2m and the initial drop height was 3.50m the car made it to the end but when the hill height was 4.25m it didn’t make it to the end. Also when the hill height was 2.75m the car made it but when the hill height was 5m it did not make it to the end. Also when the hill height was the same as the drop height ( 3.50m ) it didn’t make it. This concludes that the hill height cannot be higher or the same as the drop height other wise the cart won't make it, that is why I chose 2.75m as the hill height.
   
     I believe the car mass should be 55kg. The car mass does not affect the speed because the equation for speed is distance/time but it does, on the other hand, affect energy. While we did the trials as we increased the car mass the energy increased as well. For example, In trial 1 when the car mass was 42kg, the total energy was 1654j and when we increased the car mass to 50kg, the total energy increased to 1958j. Also when the car mass was 55kg the total energy was 2160j and when we increased the mass to 60kg the total energy increased to 2350j. In this data, you can see that the car's mass affects the energy.
