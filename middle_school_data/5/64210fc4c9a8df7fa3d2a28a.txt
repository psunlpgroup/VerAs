Me and my group said that the best height would be 4 for the initial drop and 3 for the hill height. Height affects KE PE and TE because the higher you are the more TE you have. With the more PE you have that means you have more KE because PE and KE together make up TE. When there is PE at the the top of a drop it turns into KE as it goes down.If there is no friction all of the energy will turn into KE but if there is friction the KE will be less.the law of conversation of energy Impacts the coaster because there will always be the same total energy.
