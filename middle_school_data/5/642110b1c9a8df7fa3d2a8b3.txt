Dear Potential person i am selling this to you if you find this message because its more fun than anybody else .My height of my roller coaster is 3.5 m the reason why I made this height is because at the bottom of the drop is 8.27 speed and at the top of the hill is 5.73 speed this is the reason why i made this height. Because on my data its says its safe and it also can be fun for other people.After the drop there is a 0.7 meter high loop it will make the car go slower so it doesn't hurt any passengers.After the loop there is a hill that is 0.8 meters tall to make the cart go even slower so it can stop the cart at the end so no passengers get hurt.At the start of the roller coaster the PE is high and the KE is 0, once the roll coaster is at the middle of the drop height the PE is going downwards while the KE is going upwards. the same thing is happening  before its going into the loop its the PE is going up and the KE is going down. When it hits the loop the PE is going upwards and the KE is going downwards. As the roller coaster is almost at the bottom there is a drop to slow the coaster a little bit down and the PE and KE is the same. The reason why its the same is because it has stopped at a flat surface. After the drop there is a small hill that the PE and KE is the same because at the top of the hill there is sort of a small flat surface for the cart to stop.cx and maybe just maybe after the drop there could be 1 last loop that is 1.2 for the height to make it a little bit more fun at the end and if the loop is there the PE is going upwards and the KE is going downwards. lastly there slightly might be a one last hill at the end to stop the cart and the last hill is 0.7.The mass for my cart is 40 kg i picked this mass because the mass does not affect my speed.The reason why i picked this is because i do know why this is safe and fun because it did get to the end and i checked every place where no passengers will not get hurt.
The law of conservation of energy state provides that the amount of conservation energy the PE starts at the top and the KE starts to go down but when the PE goes down the KE goes up because its being converted into thermal energy.
