The hight of my coaster will be 5m. The more hight the more PE and KE. An When the hight was 5m the carts PE at the top was 1952 and KE was 0.The more hight the more PE. When the cart was at the bottom of the hill the PE was 0 and the KE was 1952.The relationship beetween PE and KE is that combined they have to equal the total energy.The total energy has to equal PE+KE in a frictionless world. When the cart is at the top of a hill the pe would be (for and example) 1950 and the KE would be 0. when the cart moces down the PE converts into KE.
The inital drop has to be more than the hill hight becase the KE and PE would be the same the cart could not get up the hill. Mass efects the PE because the more mass there is the more PE there is. IN my data the mass was 40kg and the PE at the top of the drop was 1952, but when the mass was 60kg the PE was 2929. This also aplies to KE.
