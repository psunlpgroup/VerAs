Hello Gonzales family, I've been working on your roller coaster. I think the Initial drop height of the roller coaster should be 3.5m,  and the car should weigh about 60 kg, and we made the loop 2.5m and we have two bumps after the loop. The first one is 2m and the second one is 1m, we decided on each of these heights and mass because it's safe and fun it's safe because it doesn't go over 8.4 m/s/. Height and mass impact PE because the higher the hills are or the heavier the car is the more PE there is going to be which means the faster the car is going to go. And height and mass are in the formula for PE which is HxMxG. And it affects KE because the KE of the object will be higher if the object is placed at a greater height or the car has more mass. And it affects my total energy because My PE+KE equals my total energy. And total energy is the total energy that remains constant. And there is something called Energy transformation and Law of Conservation of Energy and it talks about how energy can't be created and destroyed.
