Hello Gonzales family I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to propose a roller coaster design that could sustain movement until the end of the ride without any abrupt stops. First, we need to start with the roller coaster car. I propose that the car be 50 pounds because though the car mass doesn't affect the speed, the car mass does affect the amount of energy that is exerted and transferred throughout the ride. Now onto the rollercoaster itself, I propose that the rollercoaster would have a drop height of 3.5 ft, because though the drop height doesn't affect the speed of the rollercoaster, how high the drop height does affects how much potential energy and energy as a whole can be used throughout the whole ride, having a drop of 3.5 ft allows the rollercoaster to have the energy needed to finish the ride without any abrupt stops. The next part of the rollercoaster would be the hill. The proposed hill would be 3 ft, this allows a fun high hill while still having enough potential energy to get to the top. After the first hill, I propose a 2.75 ft loop, thought you could substitute this with multiple hills on repeat with each hill shorter than the one before it. This pattern of hills would make sure the car had enough kinetic energy to get through the hills to the end of the ride and not be stuck somewhere. We could not have any hills higher than 3ft because due to the conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. We cannot create more potential energy to get over the hills, we can only use the kinetic energy left over to get over the shorter hills. Finally, in the end, the rollercoaster would have a steady drop from the slope and traction treads so some of the energy could be absorbed. I hope you consider my idea and have a nice night!
