You need to have a high enough drop to get up a loop and/or hill that is in the track. You also have to watch the mass because if you have to much mass you could make it down the hill. but you could not make it back up at the end Height affects PE,KE,total energy and speed because the height affect's the PE and Because the higher it is the more PE that you will have.then the PE transforms into KE when moving.Then the total energy is the when the energy was at the heist point while going down. the more Height the more speed because it have more time for gravity to pull you down because you are in the air longer.
Mass affects PE KE and total energy because the more mass that the cart has it will give it more PE. Then when the cart starts to move then the PE transforms into KE because KE is the energy while moving. and the mass affects the total energy because it makes the KE and the PE higher so then the total energy gets higher. The mass affects speed because if you have more mass then you will go faster because the more weight it will be .pulling you down at a faster rate The relationship between PE,KE ,Total energy is when you have PE it will transfer into KE. But PE will only transfer into KE when the ride starts to more. and the total energy is when the energy is at the highest point in the ride.The law of conservation of energy affects your design because. one reason why is you have to have a higher drop then your hill of loop to fully make it around or up. That is because you have to have enough energy and speed to make it up the loop and/or hill that the cart has to go up.
