My inital drop hight is 3.50 m/s because if I would go any higher it would not be safe for the people riding the roller coaster. My car mass is 50kg because mass doesn't afect speed so I will make it that we can get as many people on the roller coaster at once as possible. Height affects PE, KE, total energy, and speed by the higher the inital drop the more speed and total energy there will be, the higher total energy there is the higher PE, and KE there will be. Mass afects PE, KE, and total energy because the more mass there is teh more energy there will be but mass doesn't affect speed which means no madder how much mass the car is the speed will stay the same. During the roller coaster PE, and KE keep on tranfering back and forth for example when the car is at the top of the hill most of it's energy is PE.But when the car is at the bottom of the hill most of it's energy is KE. The total energy is what KE and PE are when they are added to each other so that means the more the more KE and PE there is the more total energy there will be. The law of conservation of energy is figuring out how to have a consistant change in speed, KE, and PE throughout the whole roller coaster and make it safe for people to ride on.
