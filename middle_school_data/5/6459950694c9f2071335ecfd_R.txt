Dear 
the Gonzalez family  
I am here to inform you about my official findings on roller coasters. 
first off we have to know that the human body can't withstand 8.4 meters per second so we have to understand that the initial height makes the potential energy for the speed. Not the mass of the cart.  The mass of the cart doesn't matter.  If you want to add features they have to be smaller than the initial drop.  So for an initial drop height that is 3 meters, you would have to put the hill and the loop or loops at less than 3 meters they also can't be the same height as the initial drop. If you have too big of an initial drop you will have too much speed and you will exceed that limit of 8.4 meters per second.  My measurements for the coaster are 3.30 meters for the initial drop.  3.25 meters for the hill. And 3.25 meters for the loop in total the total speed for the coaster comes out to 8.03 meters per second just under the 8.4 limit. you also need to know that mass doesn't affect energy. and the height of the initial drop produces the pe at the top and the pe turns into ke at the bottom of the initial drop. we also learned that pe + ke = total energy for the ride. so to make the most energy you need a big drop because energy can't be created or destroyed. So my final measurements are 3 m for the hill 3.25 for the initial drop and 3 for the loop.
