The height should be 3 meters because if it is any higher there will be too much potential energy and the car won't be able to stop. On the other hand, if it is not at 3 there won't be enough potential energy to make it through the hills and loops. This was proven during our experiments with mass and speed. 

  Potential energy is directly related to height. The higher the height the more potential energy. When the cart goes down the hill the potential energy will turn into Kinetic energy, and when reaching the bottom of the hill will result in there being no more potential energy. The total energy will be the potential energy before the drop without friction.

The law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed but converted, When I looked at my data the total energy was the same amount as my potential energy. When I added friction to my carts I noticed that my potential and kinetic energy was no longer the same. This was because the friction changed into an external source of energy that can no longer be used. 

Mass does not affect the speed at all. this was proven in our experiments when we used 60kg,50kg, and 40kg. We found that the speed at the bottom of the drop stays the same(7.66). The speed at the top of the hill stayed the same(4.40) and the speed at the end of the ride was the same(7.66).

In conclusion, the drop height should be 3 meters so the cart will be able to go over the hills and loop more efficiently. The weight of the cart should be 40kg because it needs to be able to stop at the end.
