Hello Gonzales family, my roller coaster design is both safe and exciting, according to my data. The drop height, hill, and loop all make the ride fun, yet safe. Here's why. 

My drop height is 3.6 meters. I chose this drop height because it provides enough energy to keep the coaster moving through the ride. My original plan was to have an initial drop height of 5 meters. That didn't end up working. The speed was too high to be safe, with a max speed of 9.88. I then tested and experimented until I got the height of 3.6 meters. The max speed this time was 8.84, which wasn't too fast that it was unsafe. The drop height of the roller coast also effects energy. The more height, the more energy. For example, when my height was 5 meters, the PE at the top of the drop was 2932 Joules. When my height was 4 meters, the PE at the top of the drop was 2352 Joules. When the car goes down the drop, the energy transforms from PE to KE. The PE and the KE added together are always the total energy, when there is no friction. 

The hill height I decided on is 2.5 meters. I chose this because it is less than the drop height, so the car can make it over the top of the hill. The drop height effects this because when the drop height was 5 meters, and the hill height was also 5 meters, the PE at the top of the hill was 2935 Joules. The PE at the top of the drop was 2940 Joules. These numbers were nearly equal, meaning that the car couldn't make it over the top of the hill. The hill effects the speed by being fast enough to make it to the end of the ride. 

My car mass was 60kg. I decided this because it increases the total energy. It doesn't effect speed, though. This is because when calculating the speed, the mass cancels out, making it not matter how much the car weighs. 

In conclusion, my roller coast with a drop height of 3.6 meters, hill height of 3 meters, and car mass of 60kg, is safe for riders and fun for everyone.
