The roller coaster is a thrilling ride with an initial drop height of 3.5 meters, a hill of 2.7 meters and a loop of 2.5 meters then the second hill for the very end of the ride with a height of 1.5 meters. The initial drop gives the roller coaster enough energy to complete the rest of the track. A higher hill would slow it down by too much to make it through the rest of the ride.

When the roller coaster drops down the first hill, riders feel excited. As the roller coaster enters the loop, riders feel weightless as they go upside down. then they climb up the second hill which is slightly lower than the first. They then experience a thrilling sensation as they reach the top and drop back down.

The roller coaster seat, which has a weight of 60 kilograms, experiences a series of forces that make the ride exciting. As the roller coaster drops, the seat speeds up and gains kinetic energy. When it climbs the second hill the seat dows down and gains potential energy. When the roller coaster enters the loop, the seat experiences a force that keeps it in place as it travels upside down. 

Total energy refers to all the energy that something has, including kinetic energy, potential energy, and thermal energy.

Energy transformation is the process of changing energy from one form to another. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed, only hanging from one form to another. Mass is the amount of matter in an object. Energy is the ability to do work or make things happen. It can take the form of light, heat, or motion. Energy can be transferred from one object to another, and it can be converted from one to another.

In conclusion, the roller coaster with a drop of 3.5 meters, a hill of 2.7 meters, a loop of 2.5 meters, and a second hill of 1.5 meters is an exciting ride that leaves riders feeling thrilled. The coaster's design ensures that rides experience a range of forces throughout the ride.
