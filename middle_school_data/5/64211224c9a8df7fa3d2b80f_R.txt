The height of the initial drop should be 3.5 m as at 4 m the speed exceeded 8.4 as it was 8.84. The hill height should be 1 m as in our testing we used a 2 m hill and at even a initial drop of 4 m the speed at the top of the hill went under 6.7 and the speed at the bottom of the drop was over 8.4. The mass does not affect the speed because it is canceled out from being in both equations. In our testing the speed at the bottom of a initial drop of 3.5 m the speed was always 8.27 no matter what the mass of the car was. An increase in height lead to an increase in PE, KE and total energy. This is because height is part of the equation for PE. Also because of the law of conservation of energy that energy cannot be created or destroyed. In a friction less environment the starting PE is equal to the ending KE because as the car goes down the hill the PE will transfer to the KE. If it is friction less the starting PE will equal the ending KE. All the energies added together is the total energy. In a friction less environment is the total of the PE and KE added together is the total energy. Mass creates the same affect as it is also part of the equation for PE and therefore if the mass would increase so would the PE, KE and total energy. Height also changes the speed, in our tests we found at the bottom of a 5 m drop the speed was 9.88 and at the bottom of a 3 m drop the speed was 7.66. Therefore an increase in drop height leads to an increase in speed. The law of conservation of energy plays a role in our design because in a friction less environment the starting PE is equal to the ending KE.
