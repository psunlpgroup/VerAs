My roller coaster will be the best for the Gonzalez family because my roller coaster is fun and safe, I know this because during testing I made sure it had as many features as possible while still staying under a speed of 8.4. Another reason my roller coaster is good for the Gonzalez family is that it makes it to the end safely. This was done by having each feature be shorter than the drop height so that it can actually make it over the hill and loop. The height of the drop is 3.60m, The height of the hill is 3.38 and the height of the loop is 3.04. I decided on these heights because in order to stay under a speed of 8.4 you have to have specific heights, The mass of the car is 50kg but any mass works according to our trials.

Having a higher height will affect PE, KE and TE because the higher up the drop is the more PE you have, And the more PE you have the more KE you have. And TE is just PE and KE added together at the end of the ride. due to the law of conservation of matter, every feature has to be shorter than the last, If this wasn't true we could make this ride a lot more exciting but unfortunately, we can't. 

After all that I've stated I believe that my roller coaster is the best for the Gonzalez family because it meets all of their requirements.
