Our design has an initial drop of 5m, 2 loops the first loop being 4m the second being 2m, and one 3m hill. This is so we have enough energy to make it to the end of the ride while still making it fun. Here's the science behind our design choices. We chose a 5m drop height because this way we can a lot of Potential Energy (PE) so we have more Total Energy (TE) and more PE to turn into Kinetic Energy (KE). We can also get a speed of at this height to make it through the first loop of 4m at 9.88m/s while this speed is to fast for a roller coaster our group has concluded that when friction is applied the speed will decrease to a more safe speed. Since friction is a force that resists motion and causes energy to change to non-useful forms of energy. We chose the cart to be 60kg to get more PE to transfer to KE while the cart goes through the track. Since mass does not affect speed we can't have a higher speed from the mass of the cart. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed but can transfer between energy types. Our design shows that by having hills and loops lower than the drop height so the cart has enough energy to make it to the end.
