Dear Gonzales family, after many discussions my group and I have come to a final agreement on these heights for our roller coaster. The height of our initial drop is 3.5 meters. The height of our second hill is 2.5 meters.  The height of our loop is 2.25 meters and the height of our last hill is 1 meter. Throughout this ride, the roller coaster car is 50 kg. I choose these heights because they are all heights where our riders can have fun but are still safe. They will get enough momentum and velocity throughout the ride where they will still be going at a fast pace. I and my group tested all of these heights in our simulations and after many trials, we came to a conclusion about the heights that are listed above. The potential energy in our roller coaster is affected by the initial drop of our hill height, the higher the initial drop is the more potential energy will be at the top of the ride. The mass is not affected by the potential energy because even if you have less mass going down one hill and another car with more mass going down the same hill. The speed will not change, and the car mass has no effect. The kinetic energy affects the height by the amount of speed it has. Throughout the ride potential energy transfers into kinetic energy. So the bigger the hills and loops are the more speed our car gets making it have more kinetic energy. Same thing with kinetic energy with mass and potential energy with mass it doesn't affect it. The total energy stays the same throughout the whole ride. Potential energy just converts into kinetic energy, making the total energy all kinetic at the end of the ride instead of potential at the top. Energy can not be created or destroyed just converted and that is the case with the potential and kinetic energy of our roller coaster.
