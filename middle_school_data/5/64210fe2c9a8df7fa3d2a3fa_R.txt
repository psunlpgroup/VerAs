The initial drop height for my roller coaster is 3.5 meters, the loop is 3.5 meters, the hill is 3 meters, and the mass is 60kg. I chose those heights because for my first experiment, the initial drop was 5 meters, and the speed at the end of the ride was too dangerous with the ending speed of 9.88 m/s. I chose a mass of 60kg because the mass of the roller coaster does not affect the ride's speed, so it didn't matter what the mass was for the coaster. For height and mass, the kinetic energy of the object will be higher if the object is placed at a greater height. The amount of potential energy is dependent on mass and height. On my roller coaster, energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times over the course of a ride. The law of conservation of energy says that energy is neither created nor destroyed. The law affects my design because energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times over the course of a ride. All moving objects possess kinetic energy, which is determined by the mass and speed of the object. The height of this first drop also determines the speed of the coaster cars.
