Dear Gonzales family,

First of all. the relationship between PE and KE. Is PE converts into KE. and KE converts into PE. and back again. also, energy is never created. or destroyed. 
I and my team have come up with a final design. The drop height of my design is 3.50 meters. this is because when we tested this worked the best and it's safe and fun. here are the tests. in trial one we started with 2 ID. The speed at the bottom was 6.19. The speed at the top was 0. And the speed at the end was 6.25. In trial 2 the ID was 2.75. the speed at the bottom was 7.10. the speed at the top was 2.19. the speed at the end was 7.32. And finally, in trial 3, it was 3.50 ID. the speed at the bottom was 8.20. the speed at the top was 4.41. and the speed at the end was 8.27.

For the hill height, We decided on 2.5. We made this choice Because in trial 1. we started with 2.5 and the PE (top). was 1277J. and the KE (top). was 485J. and the car can make it over the hill. 3 also works the PE (top). for that was 1474J. and the KE (top). was 240J. and the total energy for both. was 1714J. We want to go with 2.5 just to be safe

For the car mass, it doesn't really matter. But we want to go with 45. Because like I said it doesn't really matter, but in trial 1 for speed at the bottom we got 8.27. For the speed at the top, we got 3.81. And for speed at the end, we got 8.27. the law of conservation and energy impacted the ride so we had to make it a certain way.
