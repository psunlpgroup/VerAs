I think that the drop height should be 3.59m. This is because this drop height will give the passengers a safe experience on our ride, while still going fast. I know that when drop height increases the PE will increase so there will be more PE to convert to KE. I know this because when I tested a 3m drop the energy was 1,759J, but when I tested a 5m drop the energy was 2,932J. I also know that the higher the drop height the more speed. I know that the mass of the car does not matter in a frictionless world. For example, when I  tested a 40kg car it went 8.38m/s but, when I tested a 60kg car it went 8.3m/s as well. I know that the hill height needs to be less than the initial drop. I know this because if the hill height and drop height are the same the car will not make it to the end, this is the same for loops. my ride is the safest option to add to your theme park, and it will make it to the end of the ride because the loop height and hill height are the same.
