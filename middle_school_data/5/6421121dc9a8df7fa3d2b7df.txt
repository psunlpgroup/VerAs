My idea for the roller coaster is a starting drop of 4.2 meters that way it is in the speed limits of 6.7 and 8.4 meters per second that way it is safe and fun. For example in trail 1 we had a height of 5 meters and the end speed was 9.3 meters per second too fast and on trail 4 the height was 4.2 and the car moved at a speed of 7.9 meters per second. something interesting is that the mass of the car does not change the speed of the car for example in trail 1 the car had the same speed as the car in trail 4 even tho it had a mass 1.5 times greater then it the only thing that went up is the total energy.
All of this means that the drop height has to be under 4.2 and the mass of the car does not matter.The hill has to be shorter then the drop for the car to make it over the hill and a loop has to be shorter then the drop for the car to make it over it.
