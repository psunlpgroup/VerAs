Dear gonzales family.
We have made our final decision for our ID, hill height, and loop. Our ID will be 3.5, our hill height will be 2.25 and our loop height will be 2.25. Our speed is 8.27 at the end of the ride and on our roller coaster. We know our speed is a good speed because the speed is 8.27 and the highest our speed can go is 8.4 and 8.27. When we tested our trials our speed performed well and was fast that's how we know our speed is a good speed. When we tested our final trials we increased the mass by 5 every time but the speed stayed the same that is because mass doesn't affect speed. Mass doesn't affect speed because when we did any trial with us changing mass the speed would stay at 8.27 at all times. In our final trials trial, number one was 40kg but the speed stayed at 8.27, and in our final trial which was 56kg our speed still stayed the same. We now know that mass does not affect speed. Then when we did our mass and energy as we increased the mass the Pe energy increased our first trial was 40kg and our pe was 1175. When we did our last trial the mass was 50kg and the PE energy was 1616. So when we increase mass the PE will change as well. The PE at the top of the ID was  1711 and the KE at the bottom is 1711. Because in our final trial, the PE was 1711 so was KE at the bottom of the hill because when the cart goes down the PE transfers energy to KE. Because in the law of conservation, energy can't be destroyed or created but transferred so PE transfers energy to KE but in a different form.  Our ID is 3.5 because the cart needs speed but not so much speed in our final trial the speed was 8.27 and the ID made the speed 8.27 that's why we decided to choose 3.5 as our ID. In conclusion Gonzales family this is why we decided to do these heights for our final preparation.
