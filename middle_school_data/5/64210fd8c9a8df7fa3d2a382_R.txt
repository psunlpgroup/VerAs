For starter, I have designed a safe and fun roller coster. it starts with a initial drop that is 3.6 meters high. this will be fun and safe because it will have a max speed of 8.4 which is fast and safe. Because the high the hill the more energy there is because there is more distence for the car to gain speed. also the weight of the car is going to be 50kg so that it is safe. the weight of the car does not change the speed of the cart. the 60 kg car had the same speed as the 40g car. but the weight does change the energy. For example on the same track the 60kg car had more pe at the top then the 40kg car. so the more wieght the more te, pe, and ke.   Next we have a loop and a hill that are both 3 meters high making it so that the car has enough energy to make it to the end. Because if the hill and loop was over 3.6 the hight of the initial drop, then it would not have the energy to make it to the end of the track. the higher the track the more energy because there is more distance to gain energy. at the top of the drop the pe would have all the energy and the ke would be 0. but at the bottom ke has all the energy and the pe is 0. this is because as the car goes down the pe turns into ke. And when the car is going up the ke is turning into pe. And total energy is the combind total of ke, pe, and other types energy. So total energy= ke + pe. and because energy can not be created or destorded the total energy always stays the same
