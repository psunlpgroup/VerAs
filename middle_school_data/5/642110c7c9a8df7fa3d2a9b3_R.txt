For my initial drop, I chose the height to be 3.5 meters. I chose this since height and speed have a direct relationship, when height goes up speed goes up. 3.5 is the tallest it can be for it to be fun, and safe. I tested this out in the simulation and 4.3 meters had a speed of 9.13, which is too fast/dangerous. Then, when I decreased the height and set it at 3.5 meters, the speed was 8.27, which is safe and fun. Height and potential energy have a direct relationship because when height increases, PE increases. PE and KE convert to make the total amount of energy. Potential and kinetic energy have a inverse relationship, when PE goes down, KE goes up. During the roller coaster, PE converts to KE and KE converts to PE, this is because of The Law of Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is why, in a friction-less environment, KE and PE will always equal TE. 
For the mass of the car, I decided it to be 50 kg. Mass and speed do not have a relationship, therefore, I chose 50. At 60 kg the speed was 8.27 and at 50 kg, the speed was also 8.27. This is because mass and energy have a direct relationship because when mass increases, energy increases, like I saw in my data.
