   Dear Gonzales family, I believe that the drop height for your roller coaster should be 3.5 meters. This is because a drop height of 3.5 meters will give the cart an optimum speed without surpassing the speed of 8.4 m/s and keeping all passengers safely inside the ride. For example, when the initial drop height was 4 meters, the speed at the bottom of drop was 8.75 m/s, meaning that it exceeded over the limit of 8.4 m/s, but when the initial drop height was 3.5 meters the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.06 m/s, meaning the speed stayed below 8.4 m/s.

   Based off the information above, I believe that the best mass for your cart will be 50 kg. This is because mass does not affect the speed of the ride. For example when the mass of my cart was 40 kg, the speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 7.61 m/s, and when the mass increased to 55 kg, the speed at the bottom of the initial drop remained at 7.61 m/s. So based off of that information, the mass of cart does not affect the speed of the roller coaster, it does however affect the safety of the passengers. That is why I believe that the mass of the cart should be 50 kg.

   Roller coasters use many different types of energy such as mechanical, thermal, sound , potential and kinetic. The energy's of potential and kinetic transfer back and fourth as the ride moves but the energy that they use is never destroyed or lessened, this is because of total energy and the law of conservation of energy. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy can be created nor destroyed. This affects our ride by showing us how the energy between kinetic energy and potential energy transfers between one another but is never destroyed and will always equal the same amount of total energy. The total energy is the complete amount of energy that the roller coaster has between the amount of potential energy and kinetic energy.
