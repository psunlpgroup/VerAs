The Gonzales family should use our roller coaster as their new desgin. The design I have created is fast, with a big hill and a loop, and the car will make it to the end of the ride.
The faster the roller coaster goes, the more amusing it will be to the riders. Who doesn't love a fast roller coaster. But It won't be so fast that it is to much for the riders to bear. I learned that a car has to have a speed of 6.7 - 8.4 m/s. Any slower would just be boring and anything faster would cause injuries and even death. The mass of the car does not affect the speed at which the car travels at, so I decided the best mass for a car would be 56kg. 
When there are hills and loops it also entertains the riders more and is more exciting. So I chose a desgin with a big hill that leads into a loop. As they go up the hill they build potential energy, then as the riders are released down the hill, that PE turns into KE. As they start going through the loop the KE goes back to PE. Since the law of conservation of energy states energy cannot be destroyed or created, the total amount of PE and KE together will stay the same and equal the Total Energy. 
Lastly its important for the car to make it all the way through to the end of the ride. I have created a design that will take the car all the way to the end. To do that you have to make sure the amount of energy you have is enough to get it up and through all the hills and loops that you create. One way to do that is to make sure that your hill height is shorter than your initial drop height.  Or you have a chain pull to get up the first hill. Then there has to be enough energy built up by the time you get to the top so that it'll have enough energy to make it through the loop(s).
In conclusion I think the gonzales family should use my design as their new roller coaster because it's fast, has a hill and loop, and the car will make it all the way to the end of the ride.
