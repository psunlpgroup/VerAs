My recommendation for your roller coaster will make it fun but also safe. 
First off your hill shouldn't be taller than your initial drop because the car wont be able to make it all the way over and would just get stuck. I would make your hills tall but not too tall that your passengers get injured.  
Next your PE and KE are dependent on the height of the initial drop. 
The more height there is the more PE there will be at the top and more KE there will be at the bottom.
 As the car goes down and comes to the stop PE goes all the way to 0. The greater amount of height there was more total energy released in the end. 
 Following that mass wont effect your speed because of gravitational pull although, your mass shouldn't be huge but not too small so the car can go over the hills and loops. Also your energy will stay consistent throughout the ride, the energy changes from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy again until you come to a complete stop. Lastly the more mass there is the more total energy there will be at the end of the ride. Lastly the law of conservation of energy tells us that energy can neither be created or be destroyed. That shows your roller coaster at the bottom of the hill was dependent on the hill height.
