The mass of our car will be 50 kg, height of our initial drop will be 3.5 meters, the height of our first hill will be 2.5 meters, our loop will be 2 meters, and finally our last hill will be 1 meter. We chose our initial drop to be 3.5 meters because it will offer a safe ride while it still being fun. For example, the speed at the bottom of the initial drop for 3.5 meters is 8.27 m/s which is still safe and fun. Because for the coaster to not be safe, the car has to be going faster than 8.40 m/s and for the coaster to be fun, it has to be going faster than 6.7 m/s. We also decided that our first hill will be 2.5 meters because it will allow the car can get over it without stopping. For the loop we decided that it will 2 meters because it will contain enough potential energy for the ride to be fun and safe. And finally for our last hill, we decided that it will be 1 meter so the car will get over it at a fast pace so the ride will turn out fun. The height of the initial drop has a direct relationship with PE, KE, TE. Also the height of the initial drop has a direct relationship with speed because the longer an object is travelling downward, the longer it has to accelerate. Mass and speed have no relationship. When the car is travelling down the initial drop, the PE energy decreases because the elevation of the car is decreasing. But when the car is travelling down the initial drop, the KE increases because the car is going faster and creating more energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy affected how we decided the height of our hills by knowing that a hill can't be taller than the hill before it. This is because energy can't be created or destroyed.
