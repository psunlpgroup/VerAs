Dear Gonzales family,

I’ve made a roller coaster design for your amusement park. It is safe and exciting for your guests. The initial drop will be 5m and the hill height will be 3.30m so the roller coaster car can go over loops and hills quickly. Because when the hill height is taller than the initial drop it won’t have enough energy to go through the track. When a force is applied to the roller coaster car the energy turns from potential energy to kinetic energy. As much as you change the car's mass, the STH and SER won't change. The roller coaster car's mass is 55 kg because the greater the mass of the vehicle the greater the momentum you have to go through the track. Because the more mass the more kinetic energy. Depending on the motion of the roller coaster car the kinetic energy changes back and forth from potential energy to kinetic energy.
