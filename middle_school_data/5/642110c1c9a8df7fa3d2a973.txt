Hello, the rollercoaster design that we have chosen will have an initial drop of 3.5 meters, a loop of 2.5 meters, a hill of 2 meters, and a final hill height of 2.5 meters, and finally, the car's mass will be 50 kg. We decided to make the hill height and mass based on our trials because our car made it all the way through and it would probably give most of the customer's thrill and make them want to ride it again. The height and mass have a direct relationship with PE, KE, and TE meaning that if we make the hill and mass greater, then the PE, KE, and TE will become bigger. Hill height impacts speed, but mass does not. PE, KE, and TE have a direct relationship with my hill heights and loops. This made us want to make sure we do not make the hills too high because we want to make sure it is a safe ride. Though at the same time, we want to make sure they are not too low because we want to make sure they are fast. The Law of Conservation has helped us realize that all the  PE transfers to KE without friction, which has helped us to make sure that the hill heights and loops aren't higher than the initial drop.
