Dear Gonzales Family,

My roller coaster design would be highly appealing and functional. It begins with an exhilarating big drop, instantly captivating riders. Following the drop, there is a loop that provides a weightless sensation, yet maintains enough speed to ascend a hill. 

The design's viability was tested in a trial run, where the largest drop resulted in a potential energy (PE) measurement of 1585 Joules. This PE was adequate to navigate through the loop and ascend the subsequent hill until the end of the ride. It is important to note that the initial drop's height directly impacts the energy of the roller coaster. At the top of the drop, the PE is 1585 Joules, and at the end of it, it remains the same, converting from PE to kinetic energy (KE). Both forms of energy are significant for the roller coaster, as sufficient PE is required to ensure that it doesn't halt before reaching the end of the ride. As the roller coaster progresses along the track, energy undergoes a transformation. When stationary at the top, potential energy is being stored. The law of conservation of energy dictates that energy cannot be created or destroyed but can transition from one form to another. Thus, as the roller coaster moves from the top of the drop, the stored potential energy is released, transforming into kinetic energy, which is synonymous with speed and velocity. The initial drop height and the height of the subsequent hill are crucial components of the roller coaster design. A mere 2-meter drop followed by a 5-meter hill would prove inadequate, as it lacks the necessary potential energy to surmount the hill. To address this issue, designers, including myself, opt for a larger initial drop to ensure ample kinetic energy for conquering the hill and loop, ultimately reaching the end of the track. 

For the ride to be consistently fun the ride will have to be going at least 6.7 m/s but it can not exceed 8.4 m/s otherwise the passenger would die so to keep it fun the ride will be going at above 6.7 m/s throughout the ride. Something that we have discovered is that weight or mass does not change the amount of speed or velocity the cart has. we discovered this by using a simulator with 0 friction with multiple trials the mass does not change throughout the ride so in each trial the speed was the same no matter how heavy or light the cart was. 

Based on these considerations, I strongly recommend that the Gonzales family select my roller coaster design. It promises a consistently enjoyable and without the concern of peoples safety at risk. These are all the reasons on why my roller coaster should be picked.
