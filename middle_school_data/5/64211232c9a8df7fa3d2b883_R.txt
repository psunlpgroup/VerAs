After running tests on different heights and weights, I figured out the perfect height and mass of the cart and initial drop. For the initial drop your height will be 3.5  because it's not going to make your ride too slow and boring for your customers or too fast and dangerous for people to ride. The cart mass can be anywhere between 40-60kg because whenever you set your cart mass, the ride's speed will always be the same looking at my trials. PE and KE are added together to make the total energy and if you keep your initial drop at 3.5 the PE will stay the same because of the drop height. The relationship between PE and KE is when the cart is going up you gain PE and when the cart is going down that PE turns into KE. If the cart goes down you gain KE and when you go up the KE turns into PE. The speed depends on the drop height because the bigger your drop height is the faster your car will go. Or start on the ride and you should make your cart have more mass because objects with more mass have more PE, and since that changes to KE, it will give the cart more speed.
