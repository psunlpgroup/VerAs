Dear Gonzales family

These are my roller coaster ideas for you.  For the ID we are going to put it at 3.50 so it's not too high and not too low. The way I know how PE is related to the top of the ID is the car's position and that is where the stored energy is. After the car gets to the bottom the PE will turn into KE as its energy converts. The way how PE and KE affect my ride is that the PE is the way the car can move and the KE is how fast it goes and with the PE and the KE it makes the TE. For the law of conservation, energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can convert from one type of energy to another. The ride will have enough PE to make it to the end of the ride, and the PE at the top of the ID is 1711 and the KE at the bottom of the ID is 1711. Something I found is that the hill height must be lower than the ID height otherwise the car will not have enough PE to make it over the hill. Now for the car mass, it does not matter in the speed part of the ride. For the speed, the height will have a role the higher the ID the more speed you will have. The reason I will not go higher is because if I go higher the speed will go over the speed limit of the ride and the reason I won't go lower is because then the ride will be boring.
