First to start of the ride were making the initial drop 4 M because, we need enough PE to get over the hill.
Second we make the hill 3 M because, then the car can go over the hill and maintain a speed to go down after the drop. third we need to make the loop 2.75 M so the car still has enough speed to go around the loop. after the car has made it around the loop were going to end the ride. we need to make the end of the drop longer so the car has more time to slow down. if we do not make the end long the energy that is still built up will push it farther and crash. the mass of the car needs to be 50. if the cart is 60 then it will not make it around the loop. thats the good idea for the coaster
