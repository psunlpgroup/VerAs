Rollercoaster Essay #2
Dear Gonzales family,
The drop height of my rollercoaster design is 3.70 meters tall. My reason is that it will PE to change into KE to make it the end of the ride and not have an overwhelming amount of speed to make the ride unsafe. My first piece of evidence is in trial 1 when the height was 2 meters tall and the PE at the top was 969J and at the bottom of the drop the KE was 969J. My second piece of evidence is from my last trial, the height was 5 meters tall and the PE at the top was 2443J and the KE at the bottom was 2443J. That's why the drop height should be 3.7 meters tall.
The Hill height of my rollercoaster design is 3 meters tall. My reason is, it is a tall hill but it isn’t super tall and not taller than the drop because if the hill is taller than the drop the car won’t make it over the hill to finish the ride. My first piece of evidence is in trial 1, the height of the drop was 3.5 meters tall and the hill was 2 meters tall and there was enough PE to convert into KE to make it over the hill. But in trial 5, the drop height was 3.5 meters tall and the hill was taller than the drop at 5 meters tall and there was not enough TE (PE and KE) to make it over the hill and reach the end of the ride. That's why the hill height should be 3 meters tall.
The car mass of my rollercoaster design is 50 kg.  My reason is, it has a good amount of energy to make it to the end of the ride but not an overwhelming amount of mass to make an overwhelming amount of TE. My evidence is in trial 1, the mass of the car was 40 kg and the TE(PE and KE add up anywhere on the track without friction on the track) was 1955J. In my 5th trial, the car mass was 60 kg and the TE was increased to 2933J. That's why I think the car mass should be 50 kg.
Through the letter I showed you why the drop height should be 3.7 meters tall, the hill height should be 3 meters tall, and the car mass at 50 kg.
