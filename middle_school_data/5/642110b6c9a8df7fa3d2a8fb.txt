Our roller coaster will have an Initial drop of 3.5 five meters which will be safe and fun. Then a hill of 2.5 meters, A loop of 2.25 meters, and another hill of 1 meter. This will work as long as there is 0 friction because each hill or loop is bigger than the next meaning there will be enough energy to keep going. We are going to keep the mass of the car at 50 because It does not affect the speed of the roller coaster and it's right in the middle. But mass does affect KE, PE, and TE. Meaning that it will help the car go farther. Also, the heights have a direct relationship with PE, TE, KE, and speed. meaning the higher the initial drop the faster it goes and longer it goes. PE, KE, and TE have an interesting relationship. If there is no friction, No matter where you are on the ride PE + KE= TE. For example, if the car was on top of the initial drop and the PE was 1000 and KE was 0, The TE would be 1000. And if the car was in the middle of a drop and the PE was 500 and the KE was 500 it would still be 1000. This affects the coater by the PE and KE always adding up to the TE. Another factor that proves our design is key is the law of conservation. This law states that energy can not be destroyed or created. Meaning that all of the PE we have at the initial drop just turns into KE.
