Dear Gonzales family, 
When you are building your new roller coaster you will have to build a safe but functional roller coaster that many people enjoy riding. You will have to start your drop at 3.63m and your hill should be 3.00m. Even though the weight of your car doesnâ€™t affect the speed you should make your car weight 50kg. You will have to follow the Law of Conservation of Energy meaning that the PE+KE=total energy. 

Your new roller coaster needs to follow the Law of Conservation of Energy. When a car is dropped at 3.50m the PE was at 1710j and the KE was at 0j. As the car moves along the roller coaster the PE transfers into KE. Once the car gets to the bottom of the roller coaster the KE is at 1710j and the PE is at 0j. This shows us how more energy is not created as you go along the roller coaster and it's not taken away either. Since you cannot get rid of or gain total energy the hill has to be lower than the drop point of 3.63m. In order for the roller coaster to be safe it cannot have a speed above 8.4m/s. The best hill height that will work with a drop of 3.36m is 3.00m. This allows the car to be able to make it over the hill and to the end of the track without reaching a speed over 8.4m/s.

When building the new roller coaster you will have to create a drop point of 3.63m and a hill height of 3.00m. Since the car mass is 50kg the car will be able to make it over the hill when staring at 3.63m safely. Since the speed of the car can not exceed 8.4m/s the drop has to be higher than the hill height. When I dropped the car at 4.00m the amount of speed at the end of the ride was 8.84m/s. This mean that the ride was unsafe and the coaster would have to start lower than 4.00m. When the car was dropped at 3.63m the speed at the end of the ride was 8.4m/s. This means that this is the right drop for a hill of 3.00m. 

The car that had the most mass will have more total energy than the cars with a smaller mass. When the weight of the car was 45kg the total energy was 1964j. The car that weighed 60 kg had 2642j of total energy. This proves that the more mass you have means that you will have more energy. The higher the drop point affects how much PE and KE you have while on the ride. When the drop height is lower than the hill height the car will be unable to make it over the hill. When I drop the car at 5.00m height the PE at the top was 2443j. At the bottom, the KE was 2442j. Another drop point was 2.50m the PE was 1222j at the top and the KE was 1221j at the bottom. This proves that the higher the drop point is the more energy the roller coaster has. When the drop height was 4.50m and the will was 5.00m the car was unable to make it to the end of the track since the hill height needed more energy than the drop. This helped us decide the hill height, the mass of the car, and the drop height. 

When you are building the new roller coaster make sure that the hill height is smaller than the drop. You will also need to keep in mind that energy cannot be created or destroyed. The total energy is affected by the independent variables. The car mass, hill height, and drop affect how your rider's experience on the ride goes.
