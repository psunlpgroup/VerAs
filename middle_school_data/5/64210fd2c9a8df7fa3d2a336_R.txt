Dear Gonzalo Family, the drop height is going to be 5 meters because the total energy is substantial to the height of the hill. When the car mass is 50 the PE top of the initial drop (5m) would be 1958 J and KE bottom of Drop would be 1955 J. The total energy would be 1958 which would be good because the car would not need friction to get over the kill which would make it very fun for customers. No energy is created or destroyed so what happens to the mass at the bottom? It transfers to thermal energy. The height and PE are related because the higher the height the greater the PE will be at the top of the hill. The height and hill height of the track is related because the drop is a measure of energy and the hill is a measure of PE. KE and PE are the amount of energy in the sim, which means the mass depends on KE and PE. The relation between PE and KE is at the top of a hill the PE will be higher than KE when the car goes half way down the hill then the KE and PE will be the same. At the bottom of the hill the PE is none because there is none left to be used it transfers to KE and if it's not a Friction world then the leftover energy goes to Thermal energy. Mass is not related to speed because because the mass of the car in a friction world is not related. Height and PE are related because the amount of PE depends on the height of the drop.
