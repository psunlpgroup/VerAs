Rollercoaster Essay #

Dear Mr. Gonzales family, I have a proposal for the roller coaster design at your theme park. So I was thinking the Id height should be 3.50 because the PE at the top of the ride is 1715J. And  the KE and the bottom of the ID is 1706J so I think this is the perfect I'D height because also for the speed at the bottom of the hill, it is 8.26 which is fun and exciting but it is also safe and it does not go over the limit which is 8.4.

Next is when the car moves down the hill, the KE starts to go up and the PE starts to go down to 0J. Now we will be talking about the ID height and the hill height, so my crew and I were talking about the ID height should be at 3.50 and the hill height at 3.00 because if the hill height was higher then the ID the car would not be able to make it over so we were thinking that is the best hill height and the best ID for your rollercoaster. So the height of the roller coaster affects the speed of the car because the higher the rollercoaster the more likely the car will over but if the speed of the hills is bigger than 8.4 or less than 6.7 it won't be fun or safe so I think 8.26 is the perfect amount for the speed. So These are our ideas about the rollercoaster Mr. Gonzales I hope you take these ideas into consideration.
