The Gonzales family should have a hill with a height should be 3.00 and a hill for a safe rollercoaster. They should stay in a range from 6.0 to 8.4 for their speed. 
              They should have a hill with a height of 3.00 and a speed of around 7.8 for a nice simple ride. if they wanted a more attractive-looking roller coaster they should add a loop and then they would need to up the speed and the height to make it through. 
         The family should make Innovations and most important .attracting customers to theme parks. The best roller coasters. the feature saw before ideas. These elements can include inversions., such as loops., that leave riders breathless. so having a new and never .seen before design.is super important for sales.    
        but first, we have to .start with making things. like that possible having enough. force to have. the ride going the whole time is. super important. having heavier seats help them get over. hills and loops with less .energy and more speed. and that's why having more. mass will help the ride go smoother. So there should be more kinetic energy than potential and then gravity will do its work on the way down the hill and the drops to help make it over. The total energy goes .back and forth from potential to kinetic. the higher the drop the more energy. it will keep which maintains. the law of conservation of energy. it cannot be created or destroyed.
    so the Gonzales family should. consider those things too. attract attention to their park. even if it cost more money. it will be worth it in the. long run with the number of customers .and thrills they will have much more running length times and more fun with this idea of a roller coaster.
