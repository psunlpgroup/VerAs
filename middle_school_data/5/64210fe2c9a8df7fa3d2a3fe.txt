In order to have a safe and fun roller coaster the drop height should be of 3.7 meters, a hill height of 3.5 meters, and a loop height of 2.5. This is because anything above 3.7 meters has too much speed and isn't safe, but anything below that doesn't have enough speed and won't have enough energy to make it through the rest of the ride and over the hill. for example in the data I collected; when the initial drop was 3 meters the speed at the bottom of the drop was 7.65 meters per second which is fine, but the speed at the top of the was 4.41 meters per second which is to slow. However when the initial drop was 4 meters the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.8 which is too fast, but the speed at the top of he hill was 6.25 meters per second, which is a good speed. 
 The mass of the roller coaster car should be 40 kg because that is all the mass that is needed to make it over since mass does not have an affect on speed. This can be proven by the testing I did; when the mass was at 40 kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.14 meters per second. When the mass was increased to 50 kg the speed was still 8.14 meters per second. Although having more mass does increase the amount of PE and KE, 40 kg is enough to get it to the end of the ride so increasing the mass is not necessary. 
This is why having a drop height of 3.7 meters and a hill height of 3.5 meters is the best option for a fun and safe roller coaster. because it will have enough total energy to make it through the rest of the ride even though this as done in a friction less environment, adding friction will not change the total energy. because law of conservation of mass states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed only transferred to other forms. Which is why at the top of a drop you have a certain amount of PE and no KE but at the bottom you have all that in KE but no PE.
