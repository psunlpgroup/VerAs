Roller Coaster Essay #1 - REVISED
Dear the Gonzales family, my design is a great choice for the roller coaster that you are building. You will love my roller coaster design because it is safe, speedy, and most importantly fun!!

The parts of my roller coaster are all measured correctly, but are still a fun speed, and track.

Obviously the initial drop is first. The height of that is 3.28 because it cant be to high for safety reasons, for example if its 5.00, the coaster would be way to fast, and would be very dangerous. But if its to low it wont make it up the first hill, so therefore 3.28 is the best initial height.
 
The first hill height is at 3 because in order for the coaster to make it up the hill, it has to be lower then the initial height other wise the coaster wont make it up the hill. If the hill height is super low like 2.00, it would be fine but it would just not be very fun for the people on the coaster.

The loop has to be shorter than the hill because than the coaster wouldn't make it all the way up. 2.83 is perfect number because if it were to high like 4.00, than the coaster it wouldn't be good, but if its to short than the coaster will be flying, and its not safe.

The mass of the roller coaster should be 55 m. Because it cant be light otherwise it will fly of the tracks. If its to heavy like 70-100 mass the car wont make it.

The relationship of PE, and KE is important. Total energy splits between them on different parts of the roller coaster. 



I learned when I was testing different roller coasters that the heavier the car the better. 


The KE at the bottom are all one less than the  PE at the top. Also the total energy is the same as PE at the top of the hill. For example 977 is the PE, and 977 is the total energy.

Overall you should choose my roller coaster!!
