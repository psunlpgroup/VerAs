I recommend. a High roller coaster with I slightly smaller drop high so it can go over it hill and maybe a couple of loops to make the ride fun. To make this happen. You need a good mass of the car I would recommend 50 for the mass of the car. You can make the drop height as long and as High as you want but just make sure the Hill height is smaller then the drop high and the loops smaller then the hill height. to make this ride happen you need a lot of KE and PE energ.y PE for when your going up the hill. because you need lots of PE for KE to happen Because PE then it hits the drop starts to disapar so KE and Happen. Last Thing you need is speed the speed is importan.t up hill so that downhill you make more speed. And you need speed uphill so that the second down hill speed it a little less so that when you get to the loops the car slows down and the ke and pe energys are even. Thats all I have for nyou Hope your ride goes well and your theme park too.
