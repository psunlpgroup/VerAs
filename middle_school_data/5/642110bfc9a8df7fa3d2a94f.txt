My roller coaster design has an initial drop of 3.5m and a hill of 1.5m because more height equals more PE relative to mass and more speed (KE). I tested the maximum height that went through speed constraints, and it came out to 3.5. Since we don't know the friction coefficient and some energy is lost to heat, I want the hill height to be small enough that we can guarantee that the marble gets over. If the roller coaster is going faster and on a sharper hill, then the roller coaster will be more exciting. I will also have my roller coaster's weight be whatever the engineers of the car need it to be, as mass doesn't affect speed.
