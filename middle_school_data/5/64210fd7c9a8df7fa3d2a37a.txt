This roller coaster will be good for the Gonzales family because the height gives more energy and speed the higher your drop height the more energy you have My data says when the hill height is at 9 and the speed is 9.88 . You want to have a smaller hill height so your cart can make it over the hill because if it is to high the cart wont make it over the hill if your cart is not going at a good speed. When you have a higher drop height u will have be able to make it over the hill height. The car mass has nothing to do with how much energy you get. If the car mass is heavier it may not go as fast but if the car mass is lighter it may go faster. Car mass is 40 and the speed was 7.52. I think this ride is going to be safe and fun, the speed is under the maximum speed. There are some loops that I think people will enjoy. The hill height will effect the speed so the higher the hill height is the faster you will go so this ride will be run to those that like loopy roller coasters.
