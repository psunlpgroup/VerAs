The roller coaster I have constructed for the Gonzalez family will have an initial drop height of 3.5 and a hill height of 3. The car's mass would be 50 kg. I will construct it this way to maximize the effects of potential and kinetic energy. The initial drop height must be higher than the hill height because of the energy transfer. The higher the initial drop, the more potential energy it has. The amount of kinetic energy and speed at the bottom is dependent on the amount of potential energy at the top. If the hill is higher than the initial drop, it would require more kinetic energy than possible. This would cause the car to lose its speed and kinetic energy, and not make it to the end. I would also construct the car to a have neutral mass of 50 kilograms due to the fact that mass cancels out and does not effect velocity.
