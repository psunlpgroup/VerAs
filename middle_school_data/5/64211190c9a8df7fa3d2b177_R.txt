Gonzales family,
Here is the roller coaster you should use in your park. The drop height of my coaster design is 4m. This is because the higher the height, the more KE and PE it has. We don't want it to be too high, though, or the speed will exceed 8.4 m/s. The higher the drop height is, the more potential energy there is. The higher the drop height is, the more kinetic energy there is. This is evidenced by when the height was 2, the total energy was 2346. For example, when I tested the drop height of 5m, the speed was over 8.4 m/s. When I did the drop height as 2.75m, the speed was under 8.4 m/s. However, when there was 0.05 friction, the drop height of 4m didn't exceed 8.4 m/s. I added a loop and a hill, 2m and 2.25m respectively. This is for a more enjoyable ride. My car mass for the design was 50kg, but mass doesn't affect speed or energy. When I tested 40kg, 46kg, 52kg, and 60kg, the speed was the same at 9.88 at the end of the ride. The hill height has to be lower than the drop height because otherwise, the car won't be able to make it to the end. According to my data, at any height lower than the drop, the car will make it over. At the end of the ride, the energy wasn't all in PE or KE, since it transferred into other energy like thermal and sound, as well as to each other. This is because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that no energy will be lost, it will just be transferred.
