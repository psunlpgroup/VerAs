Throughout the design process my team has found some strategies that will help us build a faster, safer, and stronger roller coaster . This includes the initial drop when the initial drop is taller there is more PE at the top of the drop for it to go down a steeper slope. If the initial drop was a short slope there would be less PE at the start of the ride and KE going down the slope because of less force being applied when going down. Our roller coasters design has a initial drop height of 3.5 which we made sure is higher then our other drops and hills throughout the roller coaster. We did this so that a lot of the cars PE came from the beginning of the ride. 
Making the hills steeper also helps with the amount of KE and force added to the ride which increases the speed. We need to make sure that the height of the slopes and hills have somewhat of balance in between them so our coaster does not go over the speed limit and keeps  it safe for riders. 
Having a heavier car mass helps with increase of energy throughout the ride and helps the car go down the ride smoother and faster because there is less gravity acting on heavier objects. Having a heavy mass slows down the overall speed. I know this because when I watched the mass and speed experiment I saw that the heavier you made the mass of the car the harder it was so go down the initial drop and gain speed. This means there is less PE at the initial drop when there is a heavier car mass and more PE at the drop when the car has a lighter mass. 
Like I talked about in the begging the higher the initial drop height the more PE and KE the car has going down. Then we need to make sure that the slopes are not to high that they take away from the total amount of energy and makes it difficult for the car to get up the hills. 
Energy cant be created or disroyed during my roller coaster it can only be converted.
