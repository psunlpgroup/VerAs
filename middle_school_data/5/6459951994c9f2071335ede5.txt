hello Gonzales family I am going to give you another reason to let me build you a safe and fun roller coaster. my roller coaster design includes a 3-meter starting drop and a 2.5-meter hill with a loop of 2 meters tall it will be fast but not too fast so it's safe but not too slow that it's boring. at the bottom of the initial drop is about 7.64 meters per second and at the end of the ride, it is about 7.66 meters per second. the kinetic energy is how much energy the car has in motion but the potential energy is the amount of energy it has at the top of a hill or something. the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created nor destroyed but can be transferred so I think that is what is happening to the potential and kinetic energy.
