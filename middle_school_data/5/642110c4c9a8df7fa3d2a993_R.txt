for my initial drop i put 3.5 meters to give it the most PE and KE but also make it safe enough to ride . I think this because the faster it goes the more fun it is but to fast you die.For the hill i put it at 2 meters we have two hills so the second one is 1.5.the initial drop will give it enough KE for it to get over the hill.For the mass I put it at 50 because it is a indirect relationship between PE and KE. Also the Higher the initial drop the more Total Energy it has which mean more PE and KE. By this happening it will create a more fun ride and it will have to also be safe for the people riding.There is going to be friction so the PE will turn in heat and KE this wil make it a bit slower than if it had no friction.
