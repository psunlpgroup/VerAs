My roller coaster design has an initial drop of 3.5m and a hill of 1.5m. The hill is so much shorter because the coaster needs to get over, and real-life coasters have friction. Also, more height means more PE, and height and PE have a direct relationship with each other. This is due to the fact that when calculating PE, height is in the formula. This causes more PE to be turned into KE as the roller coaster goes down the hill. Having more PE at the beginning will also add to the total TE because TE is the sum of all energy involved, and cannot be changed because of the law of conservation of energy.  If the roller coaster is going faster and on a sharper hill, then the roller coaster will be more exciting. My roller coaster's mass doesn't matter, because it doesn't affect speed, as more mass means more energy, but it also takes the same amount more energy to get the car to move. So, a 20kg and a 100000kg car won't affect speed.
