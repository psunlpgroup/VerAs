The initial drop height will be 3.5m the loop will be 2.5m, the first hill will be 2m and the last hill will be 1m, and our car will weigh 60kg. We chose to have our initial height be 3.5m because it is the tallest safe height because it doesn't go above 8.4 m/s. We chose to have a loop height of 2.5 because it is shorter than the initial drop and there is also friction that would slow it down more and is not too long where it would waste the rest of the energy on friction for the rest of the ride. I chose to have hill heights of 1 and 2 meters because they are shorter than the initial drop and there is some room for the energy to be converted to thermal energy and still make it. The law of conservation of energy affected our decisions because we know energy can not be created or destroyed. So it would not be possible to make any of the loops or hills taller than the drop because we can't create energy we can only transform it. PE and KE have a direct relationship so when an initial drop is higher it has more stored energy wich is also another name for PE and when you go down the hill the PE transfers to KE. It is also the same way with weight PE and KE. We want to have  as much PE KE as possible because it will be able to make it up and around loops and hills easier.
