Dear gonzolas family, 

we believe that we found a rollercoaster that works with an ID of 3 meters and then a hill in the middle that's 2.5 meters and then we end it off with a fun 2.25-meter loop, with a car mass of 50kg.

 We think this will be a good option because it's safe, fast, and exciting. The reason we decided to do a loop that's 2.25 meters is that it felt bare with just a hill and a 3-meter ID and when we tried 5-meter ID and 4-meter loops the car would go too fast for it to be safe. In trial one we tried a 5-meter drop but It was too fast so we changed it to a drop height of 3 meters which worked.

Second, we made a small hill in the middle just so it would add some more suspense to the loop. PE converts to KE as it goes down the ID and up hills/down hills so the energy will go back and forth between KE and PE. The more mass a car has the longer it takes to change PE to KE and KE to PE.

PE converts to KE as the car goes down the hill and the higher the hill the more conversion you will have between PE going to KE. The higher the ID the more PE and KE you will have because they will have more energy to use or convert to KE. By adding PE and KE together you get TE. The TE is total energy, total energy is the max amount of energy that the car or object has. 

Mass doesn't change speed because in Trail 1 the mass was 40kg and the speed was 8.27 m/s and the speed was the same for 45kg and of course the same for 50kgs.

PE, KE, and TE are all types of energy, PE is potential energy, KE is kinetic energy, and TE is total energy. They all work to gather to make speed.
