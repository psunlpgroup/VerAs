I would tell the Gonzales family this time. For the heights of all parts of your roller coaster and the mass of your car I would say. Mass of your car you want to have the mass higher because then if the roller coaster is faster your car will go a little bit slower which is safer because the ride is slower safely. If car is littler then the ride will be a little bit less safe and will go at a much faster pace. If the roller coaster is going up hill the roller coaster will have PE. For the heights of all parts of your roller coaster and mass of your car. I say the heights of my roller coaster parts is for hills it is around 3.2 or 2. For mass of car my height is 1. Why you decided each height and mass based on the mass of your car. I say I decided the heights by how much space I have for the hills. Mass same thing based on room and this all has to do with the trials I did in the lab. How height and mass impact PE, KE, and total energy. The speed of your roller coaster car. I would say the height and mass impacts PE and KE and total energy and the speed of the roller coaster car by how height is how high the KE is. How high the speed is and how high the PE is. The relation between PE, KE, and total energy. And how all this affects your ride. I would say PE and KE are relation by how up hill PE takes control and down hill KE takes control. So the relation and how this affects the ride and the total energy is the ride gets taken control when they all are together. Finally how the law of conservation of energy affected your design decisions. The law of conservation of Energy affected my decisions for design. By How when designing and I realized how the total energy. The PE and the KE all didn't really form the conservation of Energy so it didn't affect my design decisions.
