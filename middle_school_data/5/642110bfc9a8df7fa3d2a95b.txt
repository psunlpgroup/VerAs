dear gonzales family,
I have finished the car blueprint and it is ready to give to you. the height of the initial drop will be 3.5 because according to my data that is the safest height you can have it at. the first hill will be 3 because in my data the first hill has to be smaller than the initial drop so this should get up the hill very fast. height and KE and PE in a direct relationship so they both go up and down together.  The total energy is the total of all the energy so it tells you how much energy there is. The law of conservation says that energy can't be created or destroyed so that means to stop the car we need friction to transfer all of the energy into heat.
