Based on my data the initial drop height is 3.5 (m) would make it fun and fast but not to fast so if the initial drop height is 3.5 (m) the speed would be 8.35 (m/s) then at the top of the initial drop 4.25 (m/s) and at the end of the ride the speed is 8.35 (m/s) which is not to boring but not to scary. The mass does not matter because it does not affect anything at all. The Conservation of energy does not mean saving energy. Instead, the law of conservation of energy says that energy is neither created nor destroyed. So As the cart falls its potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases the decrease in potential energy is almost exactly equal to the increase in kinetic energy. The mass does not effect the PE or the KE or even the speed, because No matter how much mass it is the initial drop height will make it faster or slower. To my data at the start of the initial drop PE was the same number at the total energy at the bottom The total energy of a system is the sum of the potential, kinetic, and internal energies. The height changed the PE and KE depending how tall or short it is it will change numbers but the KE will be the same as the PE always. As the height that a car is dropped from the initial drop increases, the percentage of potential energy lost also increases. Potential energy transforms into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy converts into potential energy and then back again. When the of the initial drop height is 3.5 (m) i suggest the length be almost 3.5 (m) wide but that is what makes it be the best. When testing the energy the sped of the cart at the top of the hill was always the same, the hill height will be 2.5 (m).
