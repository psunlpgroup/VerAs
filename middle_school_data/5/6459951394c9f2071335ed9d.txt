Dear Gonzales family,

I have a design that I believe is best for your family. With its drop height of 3.75, it's both fun and safe, it's also best for your initial drop height to be higher than your first hill. In my research, 5m resulted in the best chance of making it over the first hill while 2m had the lowest chance of making it over the first hill. Besides it being boring, it just doesn't work. But make sure that the height isn't too high because it will be deadly, it's a bit of finding the medium. If there's not enough energy, the roller coaster will not have enough potential energy to make It over the hill if it is higher than the initial drop height, but if it's too high it will be deadly. The higher the PE at the top of the initial drop, the higher the KE at the bottom. The reason for this is that energy cannot be created, so if your drop height is low, the ride isn't going to have enough PE and KE through for it to be exciting. 

The reason why I explain PE and KE is that these two things create the total number of energy. For example, in my research, I found that the higher PE let's say the initial PE is 2443 and the initial KE is 0. At the top of the hill, the PE will only be 833, and the KE will rise to 1611. The reason for this is most of the PE was used up on the initial drop and no KE was used. However, at the top of the hill, the KE is used because of the drop changing the PE to KE. 

I hope you will consider my advice. Best wishes, your roller coaster designer.
