Hello Gonzales Family this is why you should buy my roller coaster. I would choose the drop height of 3 meters so then the roller coaster could still be fast and safe. The mass would not matter because the mass does not affect the speed. Height effects the speed KE and PE because the higher the height is the more energy you will have and the more energy means the more speed. Mass does not effect the speed but it does effect the energy. The more mass you means the more potential energy and more total energy. Mass does not effect the speed thought it only effects the energy. The relationship between PE and KE and total energy is all because of energy transfer. PE transfers into KE and the leftover energy from KE and PE would go to thermal energy and sound energy. Law of conservation affects my design because my energy isn't created or destroyed it is transformed into the thermal and sound energy. The higher height you have will mean the more PE you will have and that means that the KE will be higher, the speed will not change though no matter the mass. The relationship between initial drop and hill height means a lot because if your initial drop is not higher than your hill height then the coaster car will not make it over the hill.
