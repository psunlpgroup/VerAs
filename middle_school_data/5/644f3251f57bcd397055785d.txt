Dear Gonzales family Newtonâ€™s Law co has found the drop height of my roller coaster design. 3.50 m because of the state of the relationship between height and energy for example when I tested the drop height of 25 cm, the PE was 15kg J. but when tested I found out we will need to find to increase the ID because the cart did not make it over the hill so. I think if we increased the ID height by a few cm it will work so we raised the ID height by a few and it did work a lot better than the first test. we tested the loop and it was a perfect addition to your roller coaster.
