We have learned that the initial drop height is the greatest factor when determining the speed of the car and its ability to make it to the end of the ride. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but only transferred into new kinds of energy. Using this knowledge, we know that when the initial drop height is 3.5 meters for example, the car has 1,710 joules of potential energy when stationary at the top of the hill. This energy cannot be lost, but it can be transferred into kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is energy an object has due to it's motion, so that determines the car's speed. The higher the height of the initial drop, the more speed the car will have because it has a greater kinetic energy. This also means that the total energy, or the sum of all kinds of energy present, is always the same as the potential energy the car has at the start. 

We also learned how mass isn't necessarily a factor when analyzing the car's total energy and speed. For example, when the car was 40 kg, it had 1,563 joules of potential energy, but when it was 60 kg, it had 2,364 joules of potential energy. However, these masses didn't affect the car's speed. When one car was 40 kg and the other was 60 kg, both cars had a speed of roughly 8.27 m/s at the bottom of the drop. This means that height affects the speed of the car because it increases it's total energy, but mass does not affect the car's speed. 

Using this data, we had decided to make the initial drop have a height of 3.5 meters to not only make the ride fast and fun, but prevent the passengers from experiencing dangerous amounts of Gs. We have also decided to make the car 60 kg because we learned that mass does not affect the car's speed. Using these numbers will ensure the car has enough potential energy to transfer into kinetic energy so the car is able to make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
