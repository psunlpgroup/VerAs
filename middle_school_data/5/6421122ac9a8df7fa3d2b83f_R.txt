I believe the initial drop height should be 3.5 meters because my data shows that the m/s is right in between 6.7 and 8.4 which was our target area. The hill height should then be lower than the 3.5 because the hill height must be lower than the initial drop sue to the conservation of energy. The hill height and inital drop height relate because the hill height must be lower than the initial droop height. With that being said height affects PE, KE, total energy and speed. Height affects these things by increasing them when height is increased. The higher the object the more speed and energy the object has. This is because the higher the object is, the farther from Earth it is and the more gravity is pulling on it. I also believe that the mass does not matter because mass does not affect the speed and only increases the PE, KE, and total energy. Mass affects the types of energy by them increasing when mass increases. These different kinds of energy all relate through energy transfer. The sum of PE and KE will always add up to TE. PE and KE switch depending on the position of the object and will always add up to TE proven by the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects the design of our roller coaster because we need our height and mass to give us enough energy to clear the ride because energy will never be added and rather will only be transferred. Drop height relates to speed as when height increases so does speed because gravity is pulling on it and the objects accelerates downwards.
