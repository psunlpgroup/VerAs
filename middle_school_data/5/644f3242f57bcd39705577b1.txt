The height of my ID is 3.50 meters. At the top of the hill, the pe is 1,520 and the ke at the end is 1,520 it switches. The relationship between us needs to have a good amount of energy if you want to get to the end. The change in pe and ke when the car is going down the hill will be the pe and turn intake because it uses the pe to get the ke. If you don't have a lot of pe you will not make it because if your hill is height then the id it will not make it. If there is mass it may not make it if you don't have a good amount of pe and a lot of mass it will not make it over the hill you will not make it to the end. If you don't have a good id height it will not have a lot of  speed and it will stop if it hit a hill
