I think that we should use the top height to give it the most PE and KE . I think this because the faster it goes the more fun it is.For the hill i think that we should have it to where it is right underneath the the initial drop because when i've done a roller coaster its more fun when you go up and almost stop then go back down.For the mass i think that we should put it at 45 because its not to light but it also is not to heavy so this will still give it a good amount of PE and KE. Adding onto the initial drop i think that also by putting it higher will make it so then it can go up a higher hill.By thie happening it will create a more fun ride and it will have to slso be safe for the people riding.
