This rollercoaster will first start off with the hill height being at 2.00 because the hill cannot be too steep otherwise the track will never be able to push the cart over the top it would just fall backward. The drop height of the roller coaster would be 3.00 because I need a steeper/bigger drop for the roller coaster so it can collect more speed so can make it over the hill. The mass of the cart cannot always have much so the tracks can use more than the roller coaster cart so it keeps the cart moving fast and nothing goes wrong. The max speed of this roller coaster is 7.7 m/s and perfectly safe for riders there is enough speed and not too much mass pulling on the cart. I added a loop and how I know its perfectly safe is that I added less mass to the cart so the cart can function. Looping over the loop and it gets enough speed from the hill that is right before it letting the loop have easy tracks for speed because the hill is carrying the weight of the cart. The height of the ride can affect the pe and ke because the more the height the less mass you need and the less height you need an equal balance of mass. The law of conservation of energy affects my roller coaster because I need it to be stable and safe for riders riding my roller coaster knowing they won't fly off. The height of the potential energy is 3.00 because the potential energy is the drop of the roller coaster. 
The energy transformed is always much more because you need mass for the energy to form. And over all my total energy would be 488 as the normal force.
