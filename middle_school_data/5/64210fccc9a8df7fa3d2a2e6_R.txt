Hello Gonzales family, me and my group have recently finalized our design for a new fun, and exciting roller coaster for your theme park. To start, I think the drop height of the roller coaster should be 3.5 meters. I think this because this is very close to the max amount of height we can go to still make it safe. This height produces 8.27 m/s of speed at the bottom of the drop making it really fast and exciting, but still safe. This height has a little over 1624 Joules. My group did not have a chance to test exactly how many Joules will be made at 3.5 meters. However, we do know that at 3 meters, it is 1624 Joules of potential energy. Moving throughout the roller coaster, this height still is going at 3.10 m/s making it slow enough for the ride to feel suspenseful but not so slow it is boring. For the mass of the car, my group was thinking 50 kg. This mass produces a lot more potential energy than a lighter car would have. For example, a 45 kg car only produces 2190 Joules of potential energy, but the 50 kg car that I like produces 2448 kg of potential energy. In a frictionless world, the car would keep all of that energy until the end of the ride and the total energy would always be the amount of potential energy we had right before the drop. But, because of the law of conservation of energy, which states energy cannot be created or destroyed, this isn't the case in the real world. Some of this energy will be lost to useless energy, like heat or sound. For speed relating to the mass of our car, we know mass doesn't affect speed so that doesn't matter. So if we have a heavier car it isn't going to go any faster than it already is. The speed at the bottom will always be 8.56 m/s in our roller coaster design. With that said though, This design is still going to be one of the best picks, and probably one of the safest.
