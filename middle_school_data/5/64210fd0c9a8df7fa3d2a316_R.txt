For the drop height it will be 5 and for the hill height it will be 3. The mass will be 50. We chose this because the heights will still make it fun but still keep it safe and the mass doesn't change the speed so we just picked something in the middle. The higher it is the more speed and PE the ride will have. The PE and the total energy is the same but as the cart goes down the more KE it will have and the less PE it will have. Mass does not affect the speed at all friction affects the speed. The law of conservation of energy affects our design because energy can not be created or destroyed and it shows us that because the total energy is the same as the PE and the mass doesn't affect the speed. The reason the PE at the top of the drop is the same as the total energy is because energy can not be created or destroyed because that is what the law of conservation of energy says. If the initial drop is not big enough then the cart wont make it over the hill but if the hill height is to big the cart also wont make it over the hill. The drop height also has to be bigger then the hill height or else the cart won't have enough energy to make it over the hill. The PE and KE combined are the same as the total energy.
