The roller coaster I have constructed for the Gonzalez family will have an initial drop height of 3.5 and a hill height of 3. The car's mass would be 50 kg. I will construct it this way to maximize the effects of potential and kinetic energy. The initial drop height must be higher than the hill height because of the energy transfer. The law of conservation of mass states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. This proves that in a no friction situation, all of the total energy will remain the same. If the hill is higher than the initial drop, it would require more kinetic energy than possible. This would cause the car to lose its speed and kinetic energy, and not make it to the end. The higher the initial drop, the more potential energy and speed it has. The amount of kinetic energy and speed at the bottom is dependent on the amount of potential energy at the top. With a drop height of 3.5, the speed at the bottom would be 8.27 meters per second. I would also construct the car to a have neutral mass of 50 kilograms due to the fact that mass cancels out and does not effect velocity.
