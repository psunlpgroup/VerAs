This is the safest and best roller coaster for the Gonzales family, all of my data will prove it! The drop height of my roller coaster design is 3 meters. This is becuase the higher the drop the more speed the coaser car will have. If the drop height is too high the coast car will go over the 8.4 m/s which is unsafe. For example in trial one the drop height was 5 meters and the end speed was 9.88 m/s. When the drop height was 3 meters the end speed was 7.65 m/s which is still fast and safe. No matter how much mass the coaster car has the speed will always stay the same. For example in trial one the mass was 40 kg and the end speed was 9.88 m/s. But in trial four the mass was 60 kg and the end speed was also 9.88 m/s. So the best mass for the coaster car is 50 kg, beucase it's not too heavy and not too light. The more height the coaster car is droped at the more potential energy it will have. The potential energy and kinetic energy gets transfered. At the top of the roller coaster the potential energy will be bigger then the kinectic but at the end of the ride the kinectic will be bigger then the potential beucase it gets transfered. In the law of consevation of mass it states that energy can change form but cannot be created or destroyed. This affects my roller coaster design beucase as the roller coaster moves along the track energy is being transfered from potential to kinetic energy but the toal energy always stays the same. The mass effects the potential and kinectic energy becuase the more mass the more potential energy there is, also changing the kinectic energy. As the potential and kinectic energy change the toal energy also will get changed. This is why the Gonzales Family should buy my roller coaster!
