I believe that the height of the drop should be 3.25 meters because it would mean that you would be able to make a bunch of hills and loops. Also because when that is the drop height should be 3.25 meters that the speed will be great enough to make it over most of the hills you want it to.  
The higher height is, it would make the KE at the start larger then the PE at the beginning. Accept, when the coaster got to the bottom of the hill. In the end the KE would be 0 and the PE would be what ever the KE was at the start. 
The mass of the coaster should be 50 kg. The mass does not effect the speed but it makes the start faster.  Also there would be a little bit less PE. Also when the mass is 50 kg because when the transfer of PE to KE is happening the would take less time to because it would have less to transfer.
The total energy would be the same as the PE and KE added.This is only because there is not friction. Then as you went down the hill all the PE would be transferred into KE.  
Even though you don't have friction there is not other type of energy that this could form into like heat energy.  This means that it will be able to hit the speeds to still have it be fun but also not to dangerous.
