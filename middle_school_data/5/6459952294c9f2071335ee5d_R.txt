Dear Gonzales family I suggest having a drop that is 150 meters high, and a small loop after that that is around 2/5 the size of the drop, then after the loop a hill that is 4 meters high.

The reason for the high hill height is so that the coaster has a lot of potential energy, which can be converted into kinetic energy, which gives the roller coaster motion, and a lot of PE and KE makes for an exciting ride. The tall height of 150 meters gives the cart a lot of potential energy.

The reason for the loopty loop is it just makes the ride more fun. The coaster will make it to the end because the loopty loop will take its energy and then give it back once it gets out of the loop, giving it energy to climb the hill. This is because of the law of conservation of that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.

The reason for the hill is because it also makes the ride more exciting and because of the energy it still has after the loop it will make it to the end of the ride.

The coaster car should also be not to heavy and not to light, as both have their cons, as mass doesnt affect speed.

Our design is the best for your amusement park, as it is really fun.
