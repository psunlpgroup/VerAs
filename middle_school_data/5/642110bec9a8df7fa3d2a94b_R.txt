Dear Gonzales family, 
We have been working on a couple roller coaster designs for you to install in your park to boost its attendance. 
       The first thing we should cover is the mass of the car. the mass should be 50 kg for a few reasons. first off, the mass of the car won't really have an effect on its speed, so the lighter the better. secondly  having a lighter car will make the ascents up the hills easier.
       Now for the actual roller coaster, the fastest speed your roller coaster can go is 8.5 (that being the fastest speed a human can withstand). if you start your roller coaster with a 3.5 meter tall drop, then the car can reach up to 8.4 ms^2 (a little under 19 miles an hour) with this we can then lead the car into a loop. The loop height we have selected is 3 meters tall, any higher and the car will have a hard time making the full circle. now after that you should have an increase of about .5 meters that then dips down 2.5 meters. this will give the car enough PE to make it up the final hill of about 3 meters to the end. 
       Now let's talk about the science behind all of this data. We have discovered that in order for the car to make it up a hill, it needs to come from a hill that is higher than the one in question. this is because the PE will be converted to KE at the bottom of each hill (PE being the amount of stored energy, and KE being the amount of released energy.) the conservation of energy states that nothing can be created or destroyed, so the car does not use up the energy it only converts it. (PE to KE) 
       These are just some designs that we hope you might take into consideration.
