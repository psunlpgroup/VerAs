dear gonzales family,
I have finished the car blueprint! For the initial drop, I chose to do 3.5 because that is safe and fun. according to my data, 3.5 is the limit that you can have because everything over that means that you will go over 8.4 and that is very dangerous. For the first hill, we are going to do 3 because we want to be extra sure that the roller coaster cars can make it all the way over without any dote. according to my data, your hill cannot make it over unless the hill is smaller than the initial drop so we chose 3 to make sure it gets over safely. Now for the loop, we chose to do 2.75 so the roller coaster car can definitely get over the hill. height and PE have a direct relationship because when the height goes up so does the PE. PE and KE are a direct relationship because the energy is transferred from one to another so when one goes up so does the other. The total energy is the total amount of energy that there is but the total energy will always be the same.  The law of conservation says that you can't create or destroy energy you can just transform it.  The hill height has to be smaller than the initial drop. Because we want to make sure that the car gets ll the way over the first hill the mass doesn't affect the speed but it does add to the energy because it has a direct relationship with PE and KE. The drop height and the speed also have a direct relationship because when the hill is up so does the speed.
