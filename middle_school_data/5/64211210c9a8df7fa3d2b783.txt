I have observed that the mass does not affect speed, so I would recommend having the car be 60 kilograms. I would then suggest that the roller coaster have a 3.5-meter high drop. The potential energy at the beginning of the ride would be 1,470 joules, which would transfer to kinetic energy as the car goes into motion. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy which states that energy can not be created nor destroyed. This also ensures that the ride will be fast but not dangerous. The speed, caused by gravity pulling the car down, would be 8.27 meters per second at the bottom of the hill. The hill would be around 2.5 meters high, this is lower than the initial drop height so that there is enough speed and energy to continue until the end. The speed at the top of the hill would be 4.4 meters per second. This will be enough because the potential energy will shift to kinetic energy so the object can stay in motion. At the end of the hill, the speed would be around 8.27 meters per second. It would be possible to add a small loop if wanted because there is enough velocity and kinetic energy.
