Hello dear Gonzales family

My engineering company has worked hard to come up with a design for a safe and fun roller coaster for your theme park. The drop height of the roller coaster design is 3.77 meters and the hill height was 2.25m. Also, the car mass should be 50 Kg. 

The ID height is 3.77m. This allows enough energy for the roller coaster to make it to the end.  The amount of potential energy was 1310J.  Potential energy is the energy that is stored in the object due to where the car is located on the hill. The higher the height increases the amount of PE. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2m, the PE was 977j. When I increased the drop height to 3.75m the pe increased to 1839j. I increased the drop height by 4.00 and the pe increased by 1715j. The amount of pe at the top of the Drop is exactly the same as the KE at the bottom of the Drop.  In addition to those two energies being the same, the total energy is equal to them too. Here's my evidence. In the first trial, the pe was 977j.  Then the KE and total energy stayed at 977j. In the second trial, the pe was 1839j and the KE was 1839j. Total energy was also 1839J. Then for the last trial, the pe was 1973j and the KE was 1973j. The total energy is also 1973j. The pe at the top of the drop always will stay the same as the KE at the bottom of the drop. The pe decreses and the ke increses. The Law of Conservation states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but can change forms.  At the height of 4m, there was 1715J of potential energy. This means that there was also 1715J of total energy.
When it comes to building a hill the hill height has to be lower than the drop. When the hill was higher or the same it did not have enough energy but when it was lower it had enough energy. for example, in trial 1 the hill height was 0.01 the speed was 7.33. In trail 2 the hill height was 0.02 the speed was 7.97. 
In trial 3 the hill was 0.02 and the speed was 8.27. In all the trials the car went over the hill because it had enough energy to git it over the track. When the hill was higher than the drop it did not make it over the hill. That,s because the rollercoaster did not have enough potential energy to git it over the hill. When the car mass increased the pe also increased. For example in trial 1 the car mass was 40 the pe was 1564. In trial 2 the car mass was 44 and the pe was 1722. In trial 3 the car mass was 52 and the pe was 2035. As the height increased the speed increased. For example, the height was 2.75 and the speed was 7.29. In trial 2 the height was 3.25 and the speed was 7.97. In trial 3 the height was 3.50 and the speed was 8.27.The
