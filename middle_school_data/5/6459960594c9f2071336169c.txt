Roller Coaster Essay 2: 

Mass, Energy and Height are the most important parts of a roller coaster. These forces help it move and gives the rider a fun filled experience. 

The mass of a roller coaster does not affect the speed and amount of Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy as shown in the Mass and Speed section where I tested the different masses. When I tested the different weight with the same drip height the 40kg cart had a equal speed to the 60kg cart both ending with 9.88 meters per second. This shows that the mass does not affect the speed of the cart because otherwise the heavier one would have more potential energy leading to it having more speed.

Energy in a roller coaster is a crucial part of it because its what gives it speed. At the start of the ride it has the most potential energy, but as the ride goes it the potential energy turns in to kinetic energy, but this energy is only converted and is not destroyed. Potential energy is converted into kinetic energy which is highest at the bottom of hills or at the end. This shows that energy is a crucial part of roller coasters because it is what allows it to move.

Height in a roller coaster is what help build up the potential energy. The higher the drop the more potential energy and the lower the drop the less potential energy. The roller coaster is not able to make it over the hill when the initial drop is the same height as the hill.

In conclusion you can see that all these factors that go into a roller coaster affect it majorly like if the initial drop isn't taller than the hill it wont make it. Or, if the mass of the cart is changed the speed stays or whenever the potential energy is a certain number the total energy of kinetic and potential will be the same the entire time.
