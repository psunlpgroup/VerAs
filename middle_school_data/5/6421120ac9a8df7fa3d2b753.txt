Dear Gonzales Family 
My team has designed a roller coaster that I think your costemers will love. I have decided that the height of the initial drop will be 3.61 meters. I decided this because from the test I have conducted the speed at the bottom will be 8.39 m/s. The reason I did not go any higher for the height is because it the speed goes over 8.4 m/s it will be putting unnecessary strain on the person riding. This means that if the speed goes over the person on the ride could end up with a brused brain. Simply put the ride would no longer be safe. For the hill I decided the hill will be at 3 meter. I decided on the because by the time the car reaches this height it will still have most of its speed because it will be able to not lose the speed by going up a super tall hill. Next for the loop I decided the height to be at 2.75 meters because then after going down the drop and up and over the hill it will still have the speed to go through the loop at this height. For the mass of the car I have it at 60 kg because then it will still be able to go through all the hills and stuff but it will end up having more PE and KE. This it becuase of how PE and KE has the equation's set (KE=1/2*M*V^2 and PE=M*H*G).     From this we can see that if I have a bigger number in for mass the PE and KE will both end up having more joules. From this the car will also have more total energy from the law of concervation of mass. The law of concervation of mass states that energy can not be lost or gained but transfered. This means that if I have more PE at the top I will have the same amount at the bottom because it is only moving from one to another. This however is not the same for speed, as you could see in the KE and PE equations (KE=1/2*M*V^2 and PE=M*H*G). Mass is in both equations meaning the when it comes to velocity (speed) it will stay the same because mass is not in the equation for speed/velocity.
