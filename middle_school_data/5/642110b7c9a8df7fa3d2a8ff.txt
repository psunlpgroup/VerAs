The initial drop height should be 3.5 which is the highest you can go and have it still be fun and safe! The loop should be next with a height of 2.5, this is so it can for sure do the loop and still be able to do the hill which should be at 1.5 this way it will also for sure make it over, and the end of the ride. Also if you want to have a little more fun you could do a loop on the initial drop which would only be 1/2 of a meter. The mass for the car doesn't matter so you can make the car as heavy as you want.
