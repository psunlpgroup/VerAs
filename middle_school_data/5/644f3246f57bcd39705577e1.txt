Dear Gonzalas family,

I understand your hopes and concerns about this rollercoaster. There are a couple of things that have to be included in the design of your ride. We have come up with a plan for the design that I hope you will approve. 
The initial drop height of the roller coaster design will be 3.75 meters. 
This is because it is a high enough height that can overpower the hill height of 2.50 meters and still make it over. While going fast to attract more tourists.
At the top of the initial drop height the PE was 1957J (with 10 friction) and the KE at the bottom was 1957J and last but not least the TE was also 1957J. In trial #1 we had the ID (initial drop) at 3.5 meters and the HH (hill height) was 2.0 meters. When the car mass was 50kg the PE at the top of the ID was 1711J and the KE at the bottom of the ID was also 1711J. In trial #2 the speed at the bottom of the Drop was 8.84m/s. In trial #3 the speed at the bottom of the Drop was also 8.84m/s. This proves that no matter the mass of the car if the ID height and the HH are the same the speed will be the same.
For example, when I tested the initial drop height of 3.5 meters, a hill height of 3.25, and a car mass of 50 the car just barely made it over and that is not safe. It's not safe to go slow on a roller coaster because it is possible that you either can stop in the middle of the ride can go backward instead of forward. This is a safe ride because the speed using 0.5 friction was in the range of 6.7-8.4 at a grand speed of 8.12. This ride is safe but fun to attract tourists.
As we know now the larger the car mass or ID height the larger the energy. The PE is what we depend on to figure out the TE and the roller coaster.
Thank you for listening to my letter and reasoning. I hope you will put what I have stated above into the final design.
