we started with the id height as 3.50 we deiced to do this so they would have the momentum to go up the hill .then the pe at the top decreased as the ke increased then at the bottom ke decreased and pe increased the id matters because. it helps the increase of ke then decrease pe 

the changes in ke and pe on the ride is that the top pe goes down and ke goes up. I won't go higher or lower with my id because if I go higher there could be a safety risk. and If I go smaller there could be concerns on the ride like not being able to go up the hill or the car mass. there would be safety and design concern it could go to slow or to fast 
  
height can affect the speed of the car because of momentum and the connection between the id height and hill height. if you have a big hill I think this would be a good design
