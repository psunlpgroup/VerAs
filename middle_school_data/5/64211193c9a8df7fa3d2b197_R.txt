Hey Gonzales family, this is why you should buy my roller coaster. I think the roller coaster i made will be the best and most fun. I found that the best drop height is 3.2 i think this because then you aren't going way too fast to get hurt but you are also not going too slow. The law of conservation of mass states that mass cannot be created or destroyed. The mess of the car does not matter because the roller coaster has 0 friction. Based off of my data any drop height higher than 3.4. based off of my data i noticed that the higher the drop then the higher the potential energy. when you have a higher potential energy then you will have a lower kinetic energy. The mass of you r car does not effect your total energy when the roller coaster is friction less. when you have a higher drop height then you will have more speed. I think that you should consider my offer because This roller coaster is safe and fun! Thanks for your time.
