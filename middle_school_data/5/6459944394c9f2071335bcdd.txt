My proposal is this: you allow my team to give you an idea that could save your business and open a new attraction to your park. My team has been working on this idea for a while now and we think you'll like it, it is called the Top Thrill Dragster. It involves science, technology, and physics and it will be able to make it to the end with pure thrill in the customer's eyes.

 Our starting height of 3.5 m and car mass of 52 kg make the PE at the start 1781 joules. This will make sure it will always make it to the end of the ride even with a hill in the middle of 3 m and a loop of 2 m. This makes it so the ride goes a good speed of 8.27 m/s, which is fast but does not endanger costumers. If it was a higher drop, it could make the ride unsafe because they would go to fast due to the fact that the higher the drop, the more speed there is. It could also be dangerous if you lower the starting height because if the car does not make it over the hill, it would just go back and forth because the amount of energy would not be enough to make it over. The 1781 joules of PE changes to KE when going down the drop because it has nowhere else to go. The total energy of the ride being 1781 J, this does not change because of the law of conservation energy stating "energy cannot be created nor destroyed." Even though PE and KE might change, this does not affect the total energy. The mass of the car, being 52 kg, makes it so it can make it over the hill because, the more mass you have, the more energy you have. But this does not effect speed in the same way though, because mass gets taken out of the equation to calculate speed.

And that concludes this proposal, I hope you take it into consideration, best of luck with your park.
