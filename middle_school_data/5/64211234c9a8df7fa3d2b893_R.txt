Dear Gonzales family,
I propose that mass has no factor in the coaster if it is a frictionless environment. I have found in my research that if the cart does have friction then mass does have a factor. For example, if the starting drop height is 5 meters and has a mass of 50 it will be faster than a cart with a mass of 20. The height of the roller coaster affects the PE and KE because when the cart is up higher it has the potential to go faster. This also means the greater the height the more room for speed or also known as PE. This means because of energy transformation the more height or PE means the more KE at the bottom. This ultimately reflects on the total energy of the coaster. Mass affects PE and KE because more mass means more speed, and the more speed the more energy. Energy includes PE and KE which is affected because this means the cart has more PE at the top of the coaster and more KE at the bottom. The relationship between PE and KE is that they are opposites, for example, when PE goes up the KE goes down. This ultimately reflects on the total energy of the coaster. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is that because of energy transfer PE at the top of the hill transfers to KE at the bottom causing the total energy to also rise. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects my coaster because the more PE stored means the coaster can get to greater speeds. This allows us to raise the mass of the cart and the number of hills and loops. Mass slows the coaster down and so do hills and loops. This is the case because when you first start the hill or loop you have a KE of zero but as you go up the hill or loop your PE increases.  This causes stored energy which the cart can then transfer back into KE.
Thanks,
