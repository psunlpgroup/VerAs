Our roller coaster is safe AND fun. How drop height when changes the potential energy for a example when I had a release height of 5 meters beside 4 meters the 5 meters one had a height potential energy because the higher you are the more potential energy you have. The same is with kinetic energy at the top it is at zero and at the bottom it has the same amount as the potential energy had at the top. The changes to kinetic energy on the way down it is half way the have the same amount. When the energy is being transfer the energy cant be crates or destroy, but it an be transfer in to kinetic energy or potential energy. The relationship between drop height and hill heights. Energy is neither created nor destroyed. Energy changes from one form of energy into another form of energy. The taller the hill the faster you can go  so the initial drop height will matter. Speed is a anther safest thing I had to make shore of because if it went too fast it wood be too dangerous like 9.8 joules and if it whats to slow it wooded be fun like 8.3 joules. So we add an hill that was 4.5 so it wood be just alb to go over it. We all so add a loop and the height was 3.5 so it wood right over it self. We tried 55 Kg for our mass of the car. Mass/weight does not mater because mass/weight can't change speed. One of the things it affects is potential energy. I can prove this because I tested 55 Kg for the mass of the car and I got 9.9 m/s. Then I tested 45 Kg for the car and got 9.88 m/s.
The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy to another.
