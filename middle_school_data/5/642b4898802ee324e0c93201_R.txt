Dear, Mr. Gonzales I have come up with the final design for the roller coaster, I hope you like what I have. 
I have chosen that the initial drop will be 3.5 meters high, the hill height is 2 meters as well as the loop. I chose these numbers because the max speed is 8.4 meters per second and the calculations showed the speed was at 8.3 meters per second. I want to make this ride as safe as possible for all of the passengers. Some of the data that I experimented with was that the more mass you added didn't do anything and the more height you added to the initial drop increased the speed so this is what I've decided on. made me decide the initial drop height was 3 meters, the hill height is 2 meters and the loop is also 2 meters, which will make the speed 8.2 meters per second.  Mass doesn't affect the speed at any means, which will mean that the initial drop height is the only thing that affects the speed. Mass affects the potential energy and kinetic energy by making them higher. It doesn't affect the total energy because it will be the same as the potential energy is. The height of this roller coaster does affect the potential energy and kinetic energy because the higher the initial drop the more potential energy there is which means there's the same amount of kinetic energy as there is potential energy. The total energy is always known if you know what the potential energy is because it's the same thing.  There is no change because energy cannot be created nor destroyed it can only be transformed and that is why potential energy and kinetic energy have a relationship. During the ride the energy will not be destroyed nor created it will only be converted into thermal and sound. The law of conservation shows the more mass the car or object carries or has the more energy it will have and it will conserve it. This is what the law of conservation means.
