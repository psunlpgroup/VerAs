Hello again Gonzales family, I'm reporting back with new, and more information that I think you should know before you build your new roller coaster. First of all your initial drop needs to be the highest hill/peak of your roller coaster. The reason for that is because the car won't get over the hill after the initial drop, or get through the loop without stopping if the hill height is higher than the initial drop. Which means your hill can't be taller than the initial drop, but the hill also can't be shorter than the loop. Also the mass of your car doesn't even effect the speed your car moves at, so the cars can be any mass. Also the initial drop height  should be around 3.5m because 3.5m is below the speed that gives you death, and above the speed that makes the roller coaster boring. Then the hills height should be around 3m because the hill height would then be lower than the initial drop making the car able  to get over this hill, and you will still have a good amount of speed. Then for the loop I think the loops height should be around 2.5 so the loop would still be fun, but the car would be able to get through the loop. Next the height of the hill impacts the PE because the higher the hill the more PE there is going to be since there is going be more KE when the car is moving down the hill. The reason there is going to be more KE is because there is a longer way down for the car to move, so the car is going to have more speed, and KE. Then at the end of the ride the total energy is the same amount of PE at the start. But since there are 3 energy and two appear when going down the hill the PE has less because mechanical energy's using up some of the PE. Lastly the law of conservation effected my design decisions when I was working with what energy was included in the roller coaster.
