 here. i will be listing reasons why you should. use MY design for your roller coaster. with my three main points being that. it is speedy. actually works, and can get to the end.

my first point. is how fast. it can go (without being dangerous). Its total energy. is 1348. and when all of that is kinetic energy. (or ke, for short), it can go pretty fast! most people like faster rollercoasters. so my design uses a relatively. high drop height for maximum energy output. speed relies on velocity. and total energy (and gravity). and the coasters have. a mass of 50kg. plus the initial drop height. is very vertical. which makes. it speed up faster. the conversion of potential energy. to kinetic energy. starts when it starts. to move. and the amount of kinetic energy. determines speed. since energy can’t be created. or destroyed. it has the same. amount of energy. throughout the entire ride--its total energy. both potential and kinetic. it doesn't. go any one number. above that since. you know it’s the total and all. again, no energy is created. or destroyed. simply changed between. potential and kinetic.

my next point. about it actually working. is that it has a large inversion!!! Almost as big. as the initial drop height. actually. But, because. it isn’t as big. it has enough kinetic energy. to make it all the way around. since if it was as tall as the drop. it would have used all. of its energy reaching the top. then going back. down the way it came. but, since it doesn't. it then regains the energy by going. back right-side-up. after rolling back down the other way. because it regains that energy. of the drop. it’s able to go over an equally tall hill. so… it works! It has no friction. which means the rollercoaster. will keep moving on its own. for a long time. as long as it’s not going uphill.

my final point. sort of a continuation of my last one. is about how it gets to the end of the ride. here’s the image for reference.

it starts with an initial drop of 2.75m. it is the highest point in the ride. The hill, inversion, and end are all 2.50m high. see my first statement. this lets the coaster ride with ease. but not too much ease. its top speed is 7.3, enough to be fun but not deadly. this is the section where i get into. the science. of the rollercoaster. its mass is 60kg, which. dosen't really. affect its speed.

Anyways, in conclusion. my rollercoaster is the best. because it is not lethal. but still puts the fun in functional.
