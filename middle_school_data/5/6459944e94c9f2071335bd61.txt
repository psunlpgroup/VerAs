dear Gonzales family 

I do hope you will find my roller coaster proposal interesting. I've run multiple tests and concluded that a roller coaster with an initial drop height of 3.65 meters in height would be perfect for your park. Compared to a height of 2 meters in height, so you understand a little better how a roller coaster works the coaster will start at the top of the drop with something called potential energy PE for short now PE. This means the energy that is stored in an object, energy not used yet, while the coaster is going down the initial drop that PE will turn into kinetic energy KE which means the amount of energy an object has while moving. also adding a larger height will increase and or decrease the PE of the coaster while it travels down, changing the height can also increase or decrease the speed of your rollercoaster. Once it reaches the bottom of that drop PE +KE =TE the total energy and the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Then there will be a hill added of a height of 2.90 meters height the hill cannot be higher than the drop or else the coaster will not pass the hill making that coaster not fun and you will lose money. now moving on mass, mass does not affect the speed of the roller coaster much so it won't matter much but the heavier it is it will have more PE the coaster will have.
