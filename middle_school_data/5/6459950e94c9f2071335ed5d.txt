 think the design should be a tall drop with a shorter hill so you still have the power and energy to go down the hill.Lets say you want the most energy i would pick 5 it has the most energy to go down the hill and to get up and i would pick 3.5 for the hill its a good number in between 4 and 3 and here s why i would pick it.


If you think about it the hill if the height is 3.5 and the height of the drop height it would be and if you make the hill height and the drop the same it wont work.this car mass and the speed will work together but they don t change each other.

i decided to do a drop and a hill then a loop to see what speed i could make it work at it took a tons of trials to even get close to 8 and right on 8.4 where its safe for riders but fun at the same time.This comes from the drop height the drop height has to be in the 3-4 range for it to be safe i started at a 5 drop but then ended up with a 3.4 and it worked right on the dot with 8.4.

when i was doing this i relised all of these things work together. they are tied together when u was changing the car mas to see if the speed would go up in down. the data i recorded showed that it just stays the same so i thought if i keep it at 50 it would be the best and just in between 40-60 so mid range.

The drop height is the most important if the drop height is to tall the speed will end up being way to fast over 8.4 which means not safe for riders at all it reached the end so it has enough momentum to get the riders to the end of the ride all safe and still managed to stay under 8.4 so i think this is a sucsessfull ride for the riders and showed this is the perfect roller coaster
