Dear Gonzales Family, 
Our team has concluded our research and designed the perfect roller coaster for your theme park. Our design will be both fun and safe! Our roller coaster will have an initial drop height of 3.5 meters and a hill height of 3 meters along with a loop that is 1.5 meters tall. In addition, our roller coaster car will have a mass of 50 kilograms. We decided the initial drop height should be 3.5 meters because the velocity that the initial drop will create will be between 6.7 and 8.4 meters per second. This will create more energy because height and PE have a direct relationship. The data I have shown from the trials proves that, because when i tested a 3.5 meter hill the velocity was 8 meters per second.  Because velocity and height have a direct relationship this makes sure the ride is still safe but is fun for the riders. The hill height is 3 meters because the hill must be less than the height of the initial drop in order for the car to be able to make it to the end of the ride. The loop height is 1.5 meters because there will be enough energy left to get the car around a loop of 1.5 meters. These measurements make sense because height and PE have a direct relationship, and KE and height also have a direct relationship. The mass of the car for the roller coaster ultimately does not affect the velocity because mass and velocity have no relationship. However, mass and PE have a direct relationship, and KE and mass also have a direct relationship. This means the higher the mass of the car, the more energy will be created. PE and KE add together to make the total amount of energy. This effects how i designed my ride because the amount of total energy stays the same throughout the ride due to the Law of Conservation of Energy. That is another reason why the height of the features on the roller coaster matter so much. I hope this information has been helpful and that you will choose our roller coaster design for your park.
