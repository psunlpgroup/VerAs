I picked to go with the highest mass possible even though it does not effect the speed it seemed like the most durable version. For the drop height I picked 3.58 because it got to the max speed of 8.4 m/s and for the look I picked width 3.6 m and height 3 m so it goes high but still has speed. lastly for the it was 2.5 m high and 4.25 m in width once again to go high and have speed. When the roller coaster is higher it has more PE, KE, and TE because when the hill is higher the roller coaster can gain more speed therefore showing there is more energy. Mass does not effect anything because no matter the mass the object will go the same speed. When you add up PE and KE it will equal total energy but as the ride moves the PE transfers in KE. Energy can not be created nor destroyed so the energy is transferred from PE to KE because it can not be destroyed.
