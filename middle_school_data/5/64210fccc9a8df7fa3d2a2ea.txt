First of all, The initial drop height would be 5 m. This is so the cart will have enough energy and speed to make it to the end of the ride. I know this because in my data it shows that for a higher initial drop height, there will be more energy and speed. For example, I had a drop height of 5 m and a speed 9.88 m/s, compared to a another test with a drop height of 3.5 m and speed of 8.27 m/s. However, for the mass of the cart me and my team have decided on a mass of 60 kg. This mass is not for more speed, as mass doesn't affect speed (In a friction-less world) it is for more TE (Total energy). TE is the total amount of energy of the cart, with more mass it will have more PE (Potential energy) which will inevitably transfer into KE (kinetic energy) as the cart moves along the track. Since there is friction in the real world, the cart will lose the amount of KE it has. This is because the energy transfers into a non-useful energy causing the cart to slow down. According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. That is how we now the energy just transfers to non-useful energy, because it can't be destroyed.
