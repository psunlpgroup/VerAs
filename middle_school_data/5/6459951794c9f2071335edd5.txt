Dear Gonzales family, in order for your roller coaster to work you need to make sure that your potential energy and kinetic energy equal one another. You will know this because, potential energy transforms into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy converts into potential energy, and then back again. When going up the hill you will notice that your kinetic energy will slowly start to transform back into potential energy.  When you go down a hill potential energy will turn into kinetic energy. Potential energy and kinetic energy equal total energy when on the roller coaster. The Law of Conservation Of Energy says
"Energy can not be created or destroyed, but...it can be convert from one type of energy to another." The relationship between initial drop height and hill is that the cart will be going in the same direction, down. But the initial drop should always be taller. In the data we put the initial drop height at 5.00m and the drop height always had to be smaller than that number, so anywhere from 4.80-1.20m. The equation is Mass x gravity x height= Â½ x mass x velocity, speed is dependent on the height and not the mass.The mass ends up getting canceled on each side. This information is shown on my data. I hope this information helps with the roller coaster, good luck!
