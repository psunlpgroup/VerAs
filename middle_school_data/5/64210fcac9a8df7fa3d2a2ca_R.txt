Our roller coaster design is filled with loops and hills. It goes underground and above ground to create a scary ride for the people. The mass we decided to go with was 50 kg. We tested 60 kg, 50 kg, and 40 kg for our data. The result was surprising, it turns out that with no friction the mass of the car does not affect the speed of the ride. For the height of the initial drop we decided on 3.6 m. We decided on this because our data showed that anything above that is too fast for the rider, which can lead to injuries. Anything below that is just too slow and will make the rider fall asleep. Our data proves this because we tested 3.7 m for the initial drop height and it was over 8.4/s/s, which is too fast. The mass of the cart does not affect speed but it does effect the energy. The more mass the cart has the more potential energy it has. Which means the more KE and total energy it has. Height affects speed and energy. The more height the more PE. Meaning, more KE and total energy for the ride. The height affects the speed because the more height it is the more speed for the ride. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is they transfer from each other. At the start when the cart is not moving it has 0 KE, but it has PE. When the cart starts moving down the drop it transfers into KE until it completely stops. That's when all the KE has transferred into thermal energy which is energy the cart can't use to move. That's if there is friction but there isn't. The law of conservation of energy is a law for energy which states energy cannot be made or destroyed. This affects my design because i can have a hill taller than my initial height or it won't make it. Also if i have too much energy i can destroy it because of the law. Mass doesn't affect speed because there is no friction. The drop height speed affects the speed meaning more speed. The initial drop needs to be taller than the hill or else the cart wont make it over.
