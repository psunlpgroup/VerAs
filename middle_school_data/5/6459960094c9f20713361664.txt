Dear Gonzales family 
I believe you should use my design because it is able to finish it run with no problems.
My first reason is it has a good initial drop it has a height of 3 m that makes it able to get all the Pe it needs and with its weight its pretty good the weight is 60 kg.  
My second reason is it has a hill with the height being 2 m so it is no problem to get over.
then my last reason is with the last thing the best the loop with a height of 2.50 m so its not that hard to finish it.
In conclusion this is why i believe you should use my roller coster
