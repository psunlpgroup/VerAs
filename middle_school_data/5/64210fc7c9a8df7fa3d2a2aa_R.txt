My design is like this. The height of the initial drop is 3.5 meters tall. I picked this height because then It could make it through the whole track without stopping. How height affects potential energy, potential, total energy and speed is When you increase the initial drop the potential energy goes up. When the potential energy goes up then the kinetic energy goes down. I picked 2.5 meters tall because the hill height need o be smaller than the initial drop son then the car can make it over the hill it get to the end. When you change the height the total energy changes to be smaller. That also changes the speed to be faster when you increase the height of he initial drop. For mass I chose 50 grams because it doesn't matter how much the car mass is. How mass effects Potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy and speed is when you change the mass it does not effect the speed of the car. The more mass the car has the more potential energy the car has. The more mass the car has the more kinetic energy it has. the relationship between Potential energy and Kinetic energy. When you go through the roller coaster the energy cannot be created or destroyed but it is only being converted  in the other types of energy. For drop height and speed I chose 3.5  and it went 4.41 m/s/s.
