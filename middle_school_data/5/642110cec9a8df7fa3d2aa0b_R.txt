I think the height of the initial drop should be 3.50m. This is because the Speed at the bottom of the drop would be 8.27m/s. I think the hill should be 2.5m. This is because the speed at the top of the hill will be 4.45m/s. Also, I think the mass of the car should be 50kg. I think this because no matter the mass of the car the speed is the same.  For example, a car with a mass of 54kg has a speed at the bottom of the drop of 8.26m/s, and a car with 50kg has a speed of 8.26m/s as well. Also, height has a direct relationship with KE and PE. So if height increases KE and PE also increase. Also, height and total energy have a direct relationship. Height and speed have a direct relationship. Height increases speed increases too. But mass and speed have no relationship. So mass has no effect on the speed. Mass and PE are a direct relationship. Mass and KE have a direct relationship. Also mass and total energy have a direct relationship.  When the car is on top of the hill the PE is max and the KE is 0. PE and KE have an inverse relationship.  When the car is moving down the drop the PE is converted to KE.  This is because energy can not be created or destroyed. But if the simulation had friction then some of the energy would be converted to thermal energy.
