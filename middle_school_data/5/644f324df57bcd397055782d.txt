Dear Gonzales Family,

I have your new roller coaster design ready for you, let's have a look! Let's start with the drop height is going to be 3.50 meters. Now I will show you how it relates to the PE and the top of the drop and the KE at the bottom. They relate to each other because the PE at the top of the hill is the same as the KE at the bottom meaning they relate to each other.

Next, there is a relationship between the PE, KE, and TE. Because as in the paragraph above the PE and TE relate to each other because they switch places going down the track. Now the TE is made up of the KE and PE doing exactly that but just adding up the KE and PE numbers. Showing that the PE, KE, and TE relate to each other.

The relationship between the ID height and the HH. Is the PE and KE energy going down the ID and going up the hill. When the cart is going down the ID the KE increases but then the PE increases going up the hill. Showing the relationship between ID height and HH.

The relationship between cart mass and PE, KE, and TE. When you increase the mass of the cart, the PE and KE both increase too. The same goes the other way when you decrease the mass of the cart the PE and KE decrease too. And since the PE and KE make up the TE this shows how the cart mass relates to the PE, KE, and TE.

The ID height affects the speed because the higher the ID is the faster the speed is. So if you want to be in that 6.7 m/s - 8.4 m/s range then you can't have your ID too high. But if you have your ID too low then it will also not be 6.7 m/s - 8.4 m/s. Showing the ID affects the speed.

The roller coaster's ID is going to be 3.5 meters and the HH is going to be 3 meters. And the weight of the cart is going to be 50 kg. Making the speed at the bottom of the ID and the end of the ride 8.27 m/s making it in the range.
