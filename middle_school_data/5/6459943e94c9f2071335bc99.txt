Dear Gonzales family,
      In this letter, I will be explaining why my roller coaster is the best design for your park and the science behind the reasoning for why the coaster is the way it is.
        
          The initial drop height for the roller coaster will be 3.60 meters and the hill height for the roller coaster will be 3 meters. The cart for the roller coaster will weigh about 50 kilograms.
    
           When looking at the height speed the roller coaster can go (8.4m/s). The data from the trial in height and speed tell us that the initial drop height shouldn't be over 3.61 meters high. Then to keep the roller coaster going throughout the ride the hill height will be 3 meters. The hill is high enough that the roller coaster will still be fun and faster, but short enough that the car will have enough momentum to get through the whole ride. 
     
          How high the initial drop height is will affect the amount of Potional energy and Kinetic energy this ride will have, that's why it's going to be 3.61 meters. The amount of PE and KE will affect the total amount of energy throughout the ride, dictating whether or not it will make it to the end without stopping. The amount of Potietal energy and Kinetic energy fluctuates during the ride. At the start, there is more PE and not any KE but by the end, there is no PE and only KE. 
     
        Looking at the law of Conservation of Energy helped me make certain design choices. When testing how high the initial drop height should be, I saw when the cart was at the bottom of the initial drop height that it would be the amount of speed the cart would have had for the duration of the ride. 
       Looking at all this data and evidence, it goes to show that my design is the best choice. The roller coaster is both the safest and the most fun. The roller coaster is made so that you are going at the top speed while still being safe and non-harmful, and letting people have fun.
