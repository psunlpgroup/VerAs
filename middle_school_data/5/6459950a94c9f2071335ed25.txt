Dear Gonzales family,

i have come to a final design that i think will make your ride fun and safe. In my trials i have tested speed, height, mass and energy. in my teams roller coaster design the initial drop is 3.05m this way you can still have enough PE which will increase the total amount of energy and enough KE  so the cart can have enough energy to make it over the hill. By having 3.05m as the initial drop it will ensure a fun and exciting ride that will be safe. In my trails where the roller coaster was 5m  the speed was 9.88 which is far over the safe speed  8.4m/s. The hill we added has a height of 3.02m its important that the hill is shorter than the initial drop so their is enough energy for the cart to make it over. 3.02m proved to be the best hill height because when testing this hill height with 3.05m as the  initial drop height the speed only came up to 7.72m/s

Now you might be wondering what about the cart mass but our team has found out that the mass of the cart does not affect the speed at all. This is shown in trail one and two in trail one the car mass was 40kg and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 7.72m/s way under the max speed limit. In trail 2 the cart mass was 60kg the highest cart mass and the speed at the bottom was 7.72m/s as well. This shows that the cart mass does not effect speed but it does effect the energy.Due to the mass of the cart the TE increases because the PE transfers to KE.  PE+KE= TE so the total energy will increase overall this is also known as the laws of conservation energycan not be created nor destroyed. This effected my roller coaster design because due to the fact that energy can not be created nor destroyed my team had to make sure their was enough energy to make it through to the end.

Last but not least me and my team added a loop.We have found that the perfect height for the loop is 2.97m this way the speed does not get over 8.4m/s and it adds more excitment to the ride.
