For what your requesting, I recommend we have a drop height of 3.6 meters. I recommend this for a couple of a different reasons, firstly, at this height, we will get the maximum amount of potential energy and speed while keeping the ride safe and fun. Essentially the higher the drop the more potential energy and the more speed. potential energy shows how many jules of energy the kart and the people in it will have. In order to fully make it through the ride we need alot of kinetic energy, and in order to get this needed energy we need potential energy. Which we obtain by having a high drop height. My second recommendation is a kart mass of 51kg, mass and energy have direct relationship. This relationship is shown in each one of my trials, for example, when the mass was 51kg it had the most amount of potential energy, kinetic energy and total energy. so in order to make the ride fun and safe this is the best way to do it. potential energy and kinetic energy have a direct relationship because when you have potential energy, as the kart goes down the hillm, potential energy transfers into kinetic energy. And in a test with friction energy also turns into useless energy like heat or sound because the energy cant be destroyed. We need the initial drop height to be higher than the hill height. because in one of my test with a drop height of 5m meters and a hill height of 5 meters the kart didnt make it over the hill so we need the hill to be lower than the initial drop. To summarize this,we will have an initial drop height of 3.6 meters for a max speed of 8.4 m/s while still being safe. Secondly a hill height of 3.5 meters because its the highest we can make it before the kart wont make it through the ride. And it will also help maintain this high speed and be still stay safe. In conclusion you should use my design becuase it is scientifically safe and fun.
