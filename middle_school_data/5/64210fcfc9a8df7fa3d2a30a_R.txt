The design I have chosen that will maximize fun while also being safe. I have set the drop height to 3.5 meters to insure that it has enough speed and energy to get through the whole ride. The higher the drop height, the more PE there will be. This is because the car is higher off the ground, and has more potential to gain energy. This will transfer to KE as the car goes down because of the law of conservation of energy. This law helps explain that energy can't be created or destroyed, which proves how the PE will transfer into KE. It also proves how total energy will always stay the same since it is the sum of all other types of energy. However, this depends on the environment. In a frictionless environment, all of the PE will turn into KE. In an environment that has friction, there will be some excess energy after the transfer in the form of heat energy, etc. This means that the total KE at the bottom will be less than the total PE at the top, so make sure that if you have worries about there being too much friction that you up the drop height for more PE. As for speed, the same idea applies. The higher the drop, the more time the car falls which in turn gains speed. In scientific terms, there is more PE which transfers to KE as the car goes down. As for the mass, I would keep it around 50kg. You want it to be enough mass to generate energy because if PE = mass x gravity x height, the more mass the more PE. The same goes for KE (.5 x m x v x v), and TE (the total amount of energy throughout the whole ride). The mass does not effect the speed because it's just changing how heavy the car is without actually applying that energy to speed. All of these things together make it sound like it'll be easy to get the right coaster, but be careful and make sure you don't go over the maximum speed. Setting the drop height to 3.5m, and hill height to 2, and the car mass to 50 will allow you to get the perfect amount of speed.
