 Dear Gonzalas Family,

Today, my company and I will show you a roller coaster design; This includes an ID height of 3.50 meters. A loop height of 2.50 meters. A hill height of 3 meters. And a car mass of 45kg, here is why. 
I picked 3.50 meters for an ID height because the PE at the top of the ID was 1541J. and the KE was 1540 at the bottom which we thought was good. The relationship between PE and KE is that they both depend on mass. and TE is when PE is added up to KE. When the car goes down the ID the PE gets converted to KE because there is motion, and when it goes up the hill it gets converted back. According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, Energy cannot be destroyed but is converted, so when the car goes down the hill the PE doesn't disappear it gets converted into KE. The relationship between ID Height and Hill height is that the Energy gets converted when the car goes down the ID and when it goes up the Hill. The criteria for Hill height is that the hill cant be higher than the ID or it won't make it over.  When you raise the car mass, the more PE, KE, and TE there are. When you raise the ID height there is a bigger chance the speed will go over the limit (8.4 m/s). But when you lower the ID height the bigger chance it will go below the speed limit (6.7 m/s). So we decided on 3.50 because the speed is 8.27 at the end of the ride and at the bottom of the ID so it would stay within the limit and will still be fun. We didn't raise the ID height, Hill height, and Car mass because if we did, the speed would go over the limit, and the car wouldn't be able to make it over the hill. and there would be too much PE, KE, and TE. We didn't lower the ID height, Hill Height, and Car mass because the speed would be too low, there wouldn't be too much fun if everything isn't tall, and we wouldn't be able to fit a lot of people if the car mass was lower. 

Sincerely,

Engineering
