I have some suggestions for the Ganzales family, to make an exciting, but safe rollercoaster. My first suggestion to the Ganzales family, is to make the initial drop higher then the hill. My second suggestion to the Gonzales family, is to make the car lighter. My final suggestion to the Gonzales family is to make the initial drop 3.3 meters to make it the most fun.
My first suggestion suggestion to the Ganzales family, is to make the initial drop higher than the hill. This is because if the initial drop is shorter than the hill the car will not make it over. My data shows this by setting the intial drop to 3m and setting th hill to 5m the car cannot make it over because there is a given total of energy. That means there is not enough total energy for it to clear the hill. 
My second suggestion is to make the car lighter, this is so that it can go faster and make it up high obects faster. My data shows this because when I set the car to a lighter weight, the faster its end speed is. For example i set my car speed to 45kg and it increased its speed. A lighte car is more fun and faster.
My final suggestion to the Gonzales family, is to make the drop height to 3.3 meters. This is because it will still be fast but not dangerous. The final speed was 8 m/s staying under the limit but still fast.
These are my three suggestions to making an exciting, and safe rollercoaster By making the initial drop higher than the hill, making the car lighter, and lastly make the intial drop to 3.3 m.
