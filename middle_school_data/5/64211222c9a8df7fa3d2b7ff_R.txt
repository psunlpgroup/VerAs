I believe that 3.5 meters is the best initial drop height. From my evidence, 3.5 meters had the most speed of 8.27 m/s which is under 8.4 making it safe to ride. I also believe that any mass could be used since mass does not affect how much speed a car has. From my research, a 40 kg car has the same speed as a 60 kg car of 7.65 m/s. Mass affects KE, PE, and total energy, from my research a 40 kg car has 1955 J and a 60 kg car has 2932 J. Height affects PE, KE, and total energy. Height changes PE, KE, total energy, and speed, from my research every time a 5-meter drop increases TE and speed more than a shorter initial drop height total energy are PE and KE added up altogether. The law of conservation of energy states that energy is transferred and not created or destroyed. Using the law of conservation of energy when a car is up on a hill the car's KE is transferred into PE, and when going down a hill the PE is transferred into KE. Using the law of conservation of energy we have to have the right amount of energy because we cannot create any energy. All the energy in an object is what total energy represents.
