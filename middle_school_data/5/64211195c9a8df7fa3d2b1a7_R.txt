Hi Gonzales family, my coaster goes just under the speed of which would cause injury so it will still be the most fun but also safe, My coaster has a high initial drop, a hill in the middle, and a loop at the end. My cart will make it to the end because there is enough energy to keep it going through both of the obstacles. this coaster can make it to the end because the energy and speed that the first drop gives allows the cart to make it over the hill. Then when it is going back down the hill the speed increases again and makes it so it can go through the loop.
