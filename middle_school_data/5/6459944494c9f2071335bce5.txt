My suggestion for your roller coaster would be to make its drop height high but because of our restrictions, I would advise you to not make your roller coaster start higher than 3.6 meters. Any height taller than that would be a  risk for any riders and would be too dangerous. Making its drop height high would not only give it time to build velocity but also let you add more loops or hills to the track after the drop. For example, a track that drops from 3 meters would have a higher potential energy than a track that drops from 2 meters. The velocity would increase because the higher the initial drop height, the higher the amount of potential energy there is. Potential energy transfers into kinetic energy as the car drops from the initial drop height because of the Law of the Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can't be created nor destroyed, so the potential energy becomes kinetic energy. If you decide to add a hill, remember that the hill height must be lower than that of the initial drop because energy can't be created, the car won't gain enough energy to make it over any hills larger than the initial drop. The mass of the car won't change the speed of the car because the mass isn't used in the equation to determine speed, so having a heavy car or a light car won't make any difference. Most importantly, make sure you make the drop height high and never make the hills taller than the initial drop height.
