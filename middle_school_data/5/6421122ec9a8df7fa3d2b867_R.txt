Hello Gonzales family, 
 We have made some decisions on the final design of our roller coaster and here they are. We have decided that the height of the initial drop should be 3.61 meters and the length of the drop is 3 meters. We have also decided that the loop which would be after the initial drop should be 3 meters and the length of the drop should be 3.6 meters. Lastly, the hill height should be 2.51 meters and the length should be 4.25 meters. We also have made the decision on the cart mass which will be 60 kg because the mass doesn't affect the speed in a frictionless environment. All of the numbers and factors put together would equal 8.39 so a very thrilling ride. In both of the equations of PE and KE height is going to affect the end result of energy and speed. The more height you have, the more speed you will have because you would have more time to build momentum going down the initial drop. In the frictionless environment, the mass would matter for the energy because of the equations of PE and KE that determine the amount of total energy involved. But the mass doesn't affect the speed because mass isn't going to matter when the cart doesn't have anything to grab onto. The law of conservation of mass states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So when talking about energy for our coaster, the KE and PE are the total energy no matter where the cart is on the track, the PE and the KE will always equal the total energy. the only time that the total energy wouldn't just be the PE and KE would be if, on the way down the initial drop, the PE wouldn't only convert to KE it might also convert into thermal energy. But again the KE wouldn't be lost, it would just be converted just like when you have more friction on the coaster and then you would have more thermal energy, that also happens when PE is converted into the KE on the way down. The energy isn't lost, it would just be changed into a different form of that energy.
