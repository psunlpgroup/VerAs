Based on some more of our testing, we believe that the roller coaster should have a drop height of 3.5 meters, and a hill of 2.5 meters. This insures that the coaster will be able to get over the hill, and they speed will be at a safe 8.3 m/s. The height of the roller coaster drop is key, because the more height a roller coaster has, the more energy, which results in more speed. The higher the hill, the more potential energy it has. This then transfers into kinetic energy, which is what will determine the speed. We also noticed that the mass of the car does not matter in terms of speed. We tested with cars that have a high mass, and a low mass, and they both had the same speeds. With these different masses and heights, we also noticed the amount of total energy stayed the same. So long as there was no friction, the energy flowed from potential to kinetic, and back. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can't be destroyed, therefore without friction, the energy has nowhere to go. But with friction, the coaster can lose energy, through sound and heat energy.
