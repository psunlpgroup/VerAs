My goal for this roller coaster was to make it both fun and safe. For starters, The drop height of the coaster will be 3 m high. To insure riders will be safe while having fun. The drop will be 3 m because the higher the height the faster the cart will be. For example, when I used a 4 m drop height the speed at the bottom was 8.84 m/s and with a drop height of 5 m the speed was 9.88 m/s. This is because the higher hill the cart is moving down, the more KE can push the cars up the next hill. Next, the hill height will be 2 m high. This is because we need to have a higher drop height than hill height so the car will make it to the end of the ride. This is necessary because KE is transformed into PE. Next, the mass of the car will be 50 kg. This is because KE depends on the mass and speed of the car. So the more mass, the more momentum, which makes it harder to slow down/change the car. The mass does not effect the speed but how hard it is to slow down. For example, when I had a car mass of 50 kg and 60 kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 7.66 m/s for both masses. Next, the faster an object moves, the more kinetic energy it has. But the more mass an object has, the less kinetic energy it has. Next, there is an inverse relationship between KE and PE. The KE and PE change as the car moves along the track. When the car is at the bottom of the hill, it is moving the fastest. This is because all of the PE has been converted to KE, which means more speed.
So the more KE we have the faster the car will go. Next, the Law of Conservation of Energy affected my design choices because I needed to know how the PE to KE transformation would effect the speed of the ride. Lastly, my ride is safe, fun and will make it through to the end of the ride.
