Dear gonzales family.
We have made our final decision for our ID, hill height, and loop. Our ID will be 3.5, our hill height will be 2.25 and our loop height will be 2.25. We chose these because it's not too fast or too slow and its still fun. Our speed at the end is 8.27 which is a good speed. The PE at the top of the ID is 1711 and the KE at the bottom is 1711. The reason why they're both 1711 is that PE transfers energy to KE. our mass is 50 kg because it goes fast but at the same time it's slow. We chose 50kg because  PE and KE will have the same energy PE transfers energy to KE cause of the law of conservation. They said energy can't be broken or created but it can be transferred so PE transfers that energy to KE.
