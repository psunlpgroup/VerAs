Dear Gonzales family our company has been working on your roller coaster design, and this is what we came up with on your roller coaster design so far.
We are changing the initial drop height to 3.5m tall because we found out that it can produce at least enough potential energy to convert into kinetic energy to go over hills and make it to the end of the ride. The hill height will be 3m tall because if it was higher than 3.5m it would not go over the hill so we put it lower than the initial drop at 3m tall so it can at least go fast over the hill. We also chose these options because we found out when we tested this roller coaster design that it was safe to ride because it is dangerous when the ride goes over 8.4m/s, the ride goes at 8.27m/s so it will be fun and safe as it is not fun if it goes below 6.7m/s. The cart mass will be at 50kg because we found out that the cart mass does not affect the speed at all when we tested this. For example, the drop height stayed the same, but we changed the mass and there was no speed difference throughout the ride. So because of this, we decided that we will go just right in the middle of our options and go with 50kg. This mass will also increase the amount of TE because of PE+KE=TE anywhere on the track. This can also be explained by that PE converts into KE as the ride accelerates.
