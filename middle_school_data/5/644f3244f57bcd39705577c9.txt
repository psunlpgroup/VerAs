Rollercoaster Essay #2
Dear Gonzales family. I am here for me and u to talk about your company. We will talk about lh, hh, Id, Pe, Ke, and Te. If the id is 3.5 hh is 2.75 car mass 50 and loop height is 2.25 as the id increases pe will increase and Ke will stay the same on tell the cart goes down the hill pe decreases and Ke increases. 
Now we will talk about Pe, Ke, Te if it was like this in 1721 j if the pe went down all will go down. The id height has to be bigger than the hill height and will go over the more minor hill but if the Second hill is bigger than the first hill it will not go over. If the id and hh are the same and the car is too Heavy it will not go up.	
The relationship between id and hill height is that if the id is not taller than hh it will not be able to go over and if was 4 id and 4 hill height it will still not go over. Now we will talk about hill height, speed, and id if the id is 3.5 and the hill height is 2.75 the speed will be just right for it to be in the range of 6.7 and 8.4 so it will be safe and funâ€¦
