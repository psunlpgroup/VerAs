Okay, Person of interest. Here's my idea.
Now that you know how science works. It's time for my colleagues and me to tell you how in the heck you are gonna build this. Now we took all numbers down by like 5 to 10 times. For ease of calculations, bare with me on this. Now, what you should do is make the drop around 4.5 meters high. And the car around(now depends on the speed of the track but you shouldn't need to change it too much) 40 KG (kilograms) or roughly 80 pounds. Now that's just the initial drop. From there you'd wanna get the car to the ground and give it a loop around 3 meters high. The loop will provide some extra PE you'll need to get over one last hill. 
Questions you may be asking: Where's my coffee? Do I trust this person? How heavy should the car be? and many, many more.

I'll answer one of those üëç.  And that's the cart weight. The reasoning behind it is that it keeps your track in a 'golden zone'. A zone where you'll be within a certain limit and where it'll stay safe while also being fun at the same time. Because I'm totally a responsible adult who knows that safety=\=fun.
And I point this out because well. You don't gain energy while you're on the ride. But you can convert it. So the PE goes into thermal energy and KE. The thermal isn't useful. But the KE is basically what makes it go fast in a sense. Without it, you wouldn't move. And with too much... you'll have people flying all over the place.

Oh, and the loop should be around 3.5 meters tall. Again. PE and KE relate. Want enough KE to get up the 3-meter hill.
