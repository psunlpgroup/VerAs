The height of the initial drop should be 3.5 meters. This is because the car at the bottom of the initial drop will have a speed of 8.27 meters per second. The maximum safe speed for a ride is 8.3 meters per second, the minimum is 6.3 meters per second. 8.27 meters per second is in that limit. The hills and loop all have a height lesser than the initial drop of 3.5 meters. If their height is greater the car won't make it to the end. For the loop, the height will be 3 meters. The first hill's height will be 2.6 meters. The second hill's height will be 2.3 meters. Because each incline is smaller than the last, the car will make it to the end. The mass of the car won't affect the speed. For example, went the mass of the car is 60 kilograms, the speed at the bottom of the drop is 8.26 meters per second. When the mass is 40 kilograms the speed at the bottom is 8.27 meters per second. Showing it doesn't affect speed. The relationship of height, potential energy, and kinetic energy is direct, because of this the car's mass will be 50 kilograms.  To explain, when the car mass is 40 kilograms the potential energy is 1955 joules. When the car's mass is 60 kilograms, the potential energy is 2933 joules. For example, when the initial drop is 5 meters the potential energy at the top is 2443 joules. At the bottom of the 5-meter drop, the kinetic energy is 2443 joules. When the initial drop's height decreases to 2 meters, at the top potential energy is 977 joules. At the bottom of the 2-meter drop, the kinetic energy is 977 joules. The relationship of mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy is direct. The total energy is potential energy added to kinetic energy. This is important because the more energy, the more likely the car will make it to the end.
