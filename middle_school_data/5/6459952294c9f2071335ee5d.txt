Dear Gonzales family I suggest having a drop that is 150 meters high, and a small loop after that that is around 2/5 the size of the drop, then after the loop a hill that is 4 meters high.

The reason for the high hill height is so that the coaster has a lot of potential energy, which can be converted into kinetic energy, which gives the roller coaster motion, and a lot of PE and KE makes for an exciting ride.

The reason for the loopty loop is it just makes the ride more fun. The coaster will make it to the end because the loopty loop will take it energy and then give it back once it gets out of the loop, giving it energy to climb the hill.

The reason for the hill is because it also makes the ride more exciting and because of the energy it still has after the loop it will make it to the end of the ride.

The coaster car should also be not to heavy and not to light, as both have their cons, and mass doesnt affect speed that much.

Our design is the best
