In our groups design we made the initial drop height 3.5 meters, and the hill height 2.5 meters while the cart being 50 kilograms. We were able to make our ride fun, but also safe at the same time. We chose these heights because they made it so the ride was going fast enough so it was fun (8.3 m/s) but just slow enough so it was still safe for the riders. This is how we know that the higher the drop height, the more speed there is. The height affected the potential energy because the more height we added to our drop, the more potential energy our ride had. Our ride was still pretty high and had enough potential energy to the point where it would have a good amount of joules of energy to go fast, but not fast enough to the point it was dangerous. The height and energy have a direct relationship because the more height the ride had, the more total energy there was. We also learned that without air resistance or friction, the mass would not affect and how fast the ride went, therefore making their relationship neutral. We also know that potential and kinetic energy have and inverse relationship. As an example, when the car was going down the track, the potential energy would go down, but the kinetic energy would go up. Meanwhile the total energy would stay the same. So the starting potential energy was just converting into kinetic energy. But once we added friction, things changed and it seemed like energy was getting destroyed because the potential and kinetic energy didn't add up to the total energy. But the truth is the energy was actually also converting into heat/thermal energy. Proving the law of conservation of energy true. That energy cannot be created or destroyed. We also know that the drop height and speed have a direct relationship because we know that the more height the more potential energy. And then when the ride starts, the potential energy will convert into kinetic energy and accelerate. Proving that the more drop height, the more speed.
