My decision for my height is 3.5 because with that height you can have fun without dying and not too low where it's not very fun. For my weight, I am going to have 55 because weight does not matter in relation to speed.
height affects pe, ke, and Te because height is in both equations, so the higher the height, the more PE and KE, and TE is the amount of energy in the whole ride. Height affects speed because the more height the more time an object has to build up speed.
Mass affects PE, KE, and TE because mass is in both equations for PE and KE so the more mass an object has the more energy they have, and TE is the amount of energy in the whole ride. Mass does not affect speed because in the equations speed does not rely on mass to get bigger.

The relationship of PE, KE, and TE is as the object moves down the hill the energy transfers all the  PE to the KE. If there is friction then some of the energy might be taken from the PE and put into thermal energy. For the TE is the total energy for both of the energy added together at the end.

The law of conservation of energy affects my design because if you have too much energy you cant take that way you have to change other variables to get a different outcome of the energy.
