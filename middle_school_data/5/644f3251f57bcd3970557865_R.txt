Dear Gonzales family,

 My engineering group and  I have decided to make the initial drop height 4 meters. This is because if it were to be 5 meters tall it wouldn't be safe, and the cart wouldnâ€™t have enough total energy to make it over the hill. It would then go back down. But since we decided to make the hill also 5 meters tall, the cart had to be a lighter weight to make the cart go over it we had to make the weight of the cart 50 so it could make it over the hill.
The reason we had to decrease the cart weight is that if it's heavier than 40, it would make the total energy would decrease, slowing it down. The reason we made the hill the same length as the drop, was so the thrill was a good amount. 
Our first idea was to make the hill height smaller than the drop so the cart could make it over it, but the problem with that is the speed, the more weight there is the slower it would move. But if we decrease the weight the faster it would go due to the amount of potential and kinetic energy there is. But as the cart goes down the potential and kinetic energy would switch numbers. like if the potential energy was 1714 and it went down to the end of the track, the kinetic energy would then be 1714. And the potential energy would be 0. The reason PE and KE are important to each other is that the potential energy is the stored energy, while the kinetic energy is the energy that is being used. And with that, the total energy would be 1714.
Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, meaning the switching of energy is rather important. The potential energy is all the stored energy that switches to kinetic energy, the energy being used. So the potential energy and kinetic energy is all the energy it will have. We made the drop height 4 meters tall, if it were any taller the cart couldn't make it over and it would go faster than the speed limit. The speed limit is 8.86 and the cart would go 8.84.
