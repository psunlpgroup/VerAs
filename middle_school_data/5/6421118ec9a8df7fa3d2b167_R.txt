Hello Gonzales family, Thank you for taking your time to read this today and see why my roller coaster is a good fit for all theme parks. Based on my data and all the trials I performed. The best drop height was 3 meters, hill height was 2.25 meters, and loop height was 2.5 meters. The mass of the car was 50KG. Which when I tested it the max speed was 7.7m/s. The height affects PE because the higher the drop the more speed there is and if the speed goes over 8.4m/s it makes it a unsafe roller coaster. But if the speed is under 6.4m/s it makes the roller coaster not as fun. Mass does not affect PE and KE because it goes at the same speed every time even though the mass is different. This is because at the end of the ride the speed was always 9.63m/s when I performed the trials with 3 different masses, including 40KG, 50KG, and 60KG. Which every time they all at the end of the ride were 9.63m/s. The relationship between PE and KE is that PE gets change into KE when movement starts to occur. Like say you have a baseball and you throw it, before you throw it there is a certain amount of PE in the ball before you throw it. Then that gets turned into KE when you throw the ball across the field. So when you think about the roller coaster when the car is moving down the hill the PE is getting transferred in KE. This is because of the law of conservation of mass, because if your PE is strong and an object isn't moving there is no KE until the object starts moving. Then the PE is getting changed into KE. But the total energy is the same amount of PE, because that is the amount of energy in the object has and it cannot exceed that amount of energy. Thank you Gonzales family for taking your time to read why my roller coaster is a good fit for any theme park that needs a new roller coaster.
