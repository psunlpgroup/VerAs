Dear Gonzales family

Our building company has been working on your coaster for a long time now! We are super excited to show you our design. We are gonna go over a few things first. The perfect ID height would be 3.50 meters. I know this because we tested many things and changed them since the last time we checked in with you. The numbers didn’t fit into the safety test. We also know that when the ID increases so does the energy. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 977 Joules. When we increased the height to 3 meters, the PE was 1466 joules. When I  increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE increased to 1955 Joules. Which was too high. While we were doing this we noticed that the PE at the top of the Inatiail drop is the same as the KE at the bottom of the Inatiail drop. They would continuously switch going down the Inatiail drop. The PE at the top added to the KE at the bottom equals total energy.
This is because when the height of the ID is greater the energy will become greater.                                                  Moving on to adding a hill we thought 3 was the best height. We know you wanted a hill higher than your ID but whenever you have a hill it needs to have a lower height than your initial drop height. We knew we had to try things lower than 3.50m.  For 3.50m you have 1714 joules so you need a height with less amount of joules. So when we did 2m as our hill height you got 982 joules. That works but we can still go higher. After that, we tried 2.50m as our hill height. We got 1228 joules, again works but we can make it higher. Lastly, we tried 3m which gave us 1469 joules. That fit perfectly. Next, we went to mass and energy. We tried many car masses.  When you increase your car mass your PE at the top and KE at the bottom increase as well. That causes the TE to increase.  In Trail 1 when we did a car mass of 40kg. Our PE and KE were 1762 joules. And then when we increased our car mass to 45kg. Our PE and KE were in 1992. We increased the car mass one more time to 50kg. Our PE and KE increased to 2387 joules. As you can see as our car mass increases so does our energy.    Moving on to drop height and speed. Whenever our drop height increases the speed does too. But your speed has to stay within the safety standards of 6.7m/s-8.4m/s.  To show our claim. In trail #1 our drop height was 2.50m. Our speed can out as 6.99m/s. In trail #2 our drop height was 3m. And our speed was 7.66m/s. In trail #3 our drop height was 3.50m and our speed was 8.26m/s. So we chose 3.50m as your coaster drop height. That gives us a speed of 8.26m/s and that keeps it fun but safe. After that, we moved on to the last thing. Mass and Speed!  No matter how much the mass of the car is the speed will be the same.  In trail #1 we started with a car mass of 40kg. Our speed was 8.84m/s. In trail #2 our car mass was  50kg. We got a speed of 8.84m/s again. We did it one more time to make sure. In trail #3 we had a car mass of 60kg. Our speed was 8.84m/s again.    This shows that no matter what your car mass is it won’t change the speed.
Thank you so much for letting us design your coaster! We have spent a lot of time figuring out the perfect design for your park. Our scientists have found lots of things about roller coasters.

Sincerely
