We have a perfect and safe rollercoaster design for the Gonzales family that is both safe and fun.
First, the initial drop height must be 3.5 and the hill must be 3.25. The height of the drop is big part of the rollercoaster. It affects the energies involved including potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy. it also affects the speed of the coaster car. The higher a drop height is the faster it will go, making sure it will be able to go over the hill. This is because it will have more potential energy at the top of a higher drop height giving it a higher total energy. and according to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed only transferred. Meaning all the PE that it has at the top of the drop with transfer to KE , the total energy will stay constant throughout the ride. Giving it the mechanical energy it needs to have speed. It should be 3.5 because based on our data, the speed of a ride with that drop height gives it a speed of 8.3 m/s. Making it a fun yet safe ride. 
Another thing to consider is the mass. The mass of the coaster car does, in fact give more PE although it does not affect the speed. We have tested this out in our trials, in our first trial the mass had started as 40 kg the speed at the bottom of the hill had been 8.26 m/s. Compared to 50 kg and the speed had still been 8.26 m/s. This happens because Potential energy will equal Kinetic energy. Both equations will contain mass so they cancel out, therefor not affecting the speeds, and only the energies. All of this proves that height is the only thing that is able to change the speed during the ride. 
These are our suggestions and I hope they are taken into consideration.
