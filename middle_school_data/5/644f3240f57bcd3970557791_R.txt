Rollercoaster Essay #

Dear Mr. Gonzales family, I have a proposal for the roller coaster design at your theme park. So I was thinking the Id height should be 3.50 because the speed of the roller coaster can not be over 8.4 and not lower than 6.7 and the ID is at 3.50 the speed is 8.26 so it is just right so that's what I think the ID height should be for you rollercoaster.

Next, when we have the mass of the car I think it should be 54. Because even when we change the mass of the car the speed will always stay the same in trail 1# the mass of the car was 50 and the speed was 8.27 but when I change the mass to 52 in trail 2# it is still 8.27 so when you increase the mass of the car the speed will always stay the same. 
 
Now for the mass and energy when you increase the mass of the car the PE and total energy will both be the same but the numbers of Joules always get bigger when you increase the mass. Like in Trail 1#, we had the mass of the car at 54  and the PE and total energy was 2115.  But in Trail 2# the car mass was 56 and the PE and total energy went up to 2191J so when you increase the car mass the Energy will also increase. 

So now for the ID and the hill height, I think that 3.50 is the perfect ID height and the hill height should be 3.00 because if you have the hill height taller than the initial drop the car will not be likely to go over the hill so I think 3.50 and 3.00 is the perfect hill height and ID height fo your roller coaster. 

 So, in conclusion, I hope you take these ideas into consideration For your roller coaster thank you for your time.
