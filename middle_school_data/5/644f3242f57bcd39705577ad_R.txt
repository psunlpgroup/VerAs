Dear, Gonzales family 
  
My company has a fun and exciting fast roller coaster for you, we made it with nice big drops and loops, and we made the ID height 3.58m because The higher the height the more energy the cart will have so we wanted to make it a reasonable height. For example, when I tested the drop height of 5.00 meters the PE was 2443J. When I decreased the drop height to 3.58 the PE decreased to 1751. If the height of my ID is more then there is more PE at the top of the hill and more KE at the bottom of the hill. The more PE and KE in the ride equaled back to the TE in the ride. And when the cart is moving down the hill the PE at the top of the hill is decreasing and the KE at the bottom of the hill is increasing. It's important to have enough PE to make it through to the end of the ride and it's also important to have enough energy overall and the energy changes that is where the law of conversation comes in. It's very important to have the hill height shorter than the ID because if it isn't you will not make it to the end of the ride. the bigger the mass of the car the easier it is to make it to the end of the ride. The higher the height the more speed it will affect on the car but there are safety precautions and there are speeds and mass and other precautions you have to be aware of for the safety of the ride.
