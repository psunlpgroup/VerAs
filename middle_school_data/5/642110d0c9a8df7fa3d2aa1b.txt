Hello Gonzales family,
The roller coaster that I am designing will have an initial drop height of 3.5 m. I chose this height because 3.5 is the highest you can go with it being safe. This will cause the ride to still be fun but also have a tall initial drop. I choose this height because using my data if I have an initial drop height that is 4 m and a hill height that is 5 m. the cart did not make it to the end of the track because the hill was taller than the initial drop. There is the most amount of potential energy at the top of the initial drop and no KE because it is at rest. After the initial drop I will be adding a hill that is 2.5 m. I added this because it made the ride more fun but it also with the height I chose was still able to get over the hill. I know this because from my simulation when the initial drop height was 4 m, and the hill height was 5 m the cart did not make it to the end of the track. At the top of this hill there would be more PE because the object is on a flat surface. After the hill i'm adding a loop that is 2.5 m tall. I chose this because it is very fun and still shorter than the initial drop so the cart will make it to the end. When the cart is going around there will be more KE than PE because the cart is moving. The mass I will be choosing for my car is 60 kg. I am choosing this because the more mass the more energy. I used my data to figure out that when the mass was 45 the total energy was 1614. But when the mass was 55 the total energy was 1961. And when there is more total energy. This ride will still be safe though because according to my simulation mass does not affect speed. When the car mass is 54 the speed is 8.27 and when the mass is 56 the speed is 8.27. This shows that no matter the mass the speed will stay the same. And because I have a safe initial drop height the ride will not be to fast where it would hurt someone. 

So this is my idea for a perfect, fun, and safe roller coaster.
