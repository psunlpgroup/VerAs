The goal of this roller coaster design is to create an exciting yet safe ride for the Gonzales family's amusement park. To accomplish this, we focused on the relationships between initial drop and hill heights to ensure the roller coaster car has enough energy to make it to the end of the ride. We used the simulation to test our design, which includes an initial drop of 30 meters and a hill with a height of 20 meters. Our design is based on scientific principles, particularly the concept of Brachistochrone curves.
Brachistochrone curves help engineers and drafters design roller coasters that accelerate the car to the highest possible speed in a quick vertical drop. By incorporating a 30-meter initial drop and a hill with a height of 20 meters, we have ensured that the roller coaster car has enough energy to make it to the end of the ride without stopping. We also considered the impact of car mass on energy and speed, which influenced our choice of materials to ensure safety.
One important factor in our roller coaster design was safety. As the maximum speed of roller coasters can reach up to 206 km/h, we had to ensure that our roller coaster was designed and manufactured with safety as a top priority. To ensure safety, we used materials that were appropriate for the load-carrying capacity of each roller coaster component and made sure to follow safety standards during construction. Moreover, we analyzed the load distribution and deformation results of our roller coaster car using the ANSYS program to ensure it can withstand different types of impacts that may
