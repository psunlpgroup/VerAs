The initial drop height for my roller coaster is 3.5 meters, the loop is 3.5 meters, the hill is 3 meters, and the mass is 60kg. I chose those heights because for my first experiment, the initial drop was 5 meters, and the speed at the end of the ride was too dangerous with the ending speed of 9.88 m/s. I chose a mass of 60kg because the mass of the roller coaster does not affect the ride's speed, so it didn't matter what the mass was for the coaster. 
For height and mass, the kinetic energy of the object will be higher if the object is placed at a greater height. On my roller coaster, energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times over the course of a ride. The law of conservation of energy affects my design, energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times over the course of a ride.
