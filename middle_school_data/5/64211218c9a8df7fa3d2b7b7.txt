I think the mass of your roller coaster car should be 50kg because mass doesn't affect speed, it only affects        PE, KE, and total energy. The more mass an object has, the more total energy it has, but more mass doesn't mean faster. Your initial drop height should be 3.5 meters, because that would make the ride very fast and fun, but also keeps the speed below 8.4 m/s so the ride is still very safe. The height of your hill should be 3 meters because it has to be shorter than the initial drop height so the car can make it over and it will keep the ride entertaining. The taller the height of the drop, the more PE and total energy there is, meaning there will be more kinetic energy as well. Also, the taller a drop is, the faster the car will be. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be destroyed, it is just transferred from one form to another. For example, PE is transferred to KE when the car goes down the drop or hill, and all energy adds up to the total energy, which stays the same throughout the ride.
