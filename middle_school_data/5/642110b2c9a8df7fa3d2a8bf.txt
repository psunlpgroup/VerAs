Why our coaster is the best for being safe and fun is because. At the start of the coaster it is 1 m tall, And the mass is 0.5 kg. And the height is great so we can have it be fun for as long as possible to make it enjoyable. And the mass is high because from our testing, the mass will barely affect the roller coaster. And if there is a high amount of mass you can put more people on the carts. And also there is greater friction and G force, as well as greater ability to hold Kinetic energy so it can be active longer because it loses little speed. The reason why the height of the initial drop is 1 and the height of the hills and loops are lower than that is because. The law of conservation of energy says we cannot create or destroy energy. So if the hill height is higher than the initial drop, You need more energy than you can make from the initial drop to make it over the hill. And that is not possible because of the law of conservation of energy. And the total energy is all the amount of energy combined, so that number will not change, because we don't create or remove energy without converting it from another energy.
