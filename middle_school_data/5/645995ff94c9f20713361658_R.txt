To have a safe roller coaster you have to calculate everything in order to built the coaster. A roller coaster requires kinetic and potential energy. Along with mass, and appropriate hills and drop heights.
    Drop height is important for roller coasters. Typically, the biggest hill/drop is the first, so that there's enough energy to finish the roller coaster. Other hills help add on to the first big drop, as well so that it can go to the end of the coaster. This helps so there's enough kinetic and potential energy to make it to the end. With a drop height of 3.50m, my cart was able to make it to the end of the track including a loop and a hill. With a drop height of 2.50m it was not able to make it to the end. This is because the drop height and hill height are the same. Hill and drop height cannot be the same or else it won't be able to make it to the end. Adding hills is very helpful and makes it more enjoyable for the riders. 
    Mass does not affect the speed of a roller coaster. With a mass of 40kg, the speed at the end of the ride was 8.27m/s. For a mass of 60kg, the speed at the end of the ride was also 8.27m/s. Both had no friction. But, with more mass the bigger the car. With less mass, the smaller the car.
    As said before, a roller coaster has to has to have kinetic and potential energy. Potential energy is when you go up hills, and kinetic is where you go down. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be changed from one to another. Such as going down hill, there is still potential energy but it is changing to kinetic. 
    These are are the qualities to have inn order to have a good, safe, and fun roller coaster!
