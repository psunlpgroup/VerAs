Hello Gonzales, 
I have been doing research on creating your roller coaster and I have come to a conclusion on how we should build it. You have to have an initial drop of 5m because you will then have the most speed possible while also being safe. I know that 5m is the best drop because from my data a drop from 5m had a speed at the bottom of the drop of 9.83m/s/s but when we tried decreasing the drop height to 4m the speed significantly decreased by a m/s/s to 8.84m/s/s. Then from the drop we should go straight into the loop to make sure we have the most amount of energy to get through the loop. We know the loop has to have a lower height than the initial drop to make it through the loop. For the hill height, it has to be around 3 meters so it will go over the hill and make it to the end. After data with an initial drop of 5 meters and a hill of 3 meters, you will have the highest speed going over the hill. We have also found that mass does not affect speed at all. From our data, we tried different masses going down drops and at 40kg and 60kg the speed was the exact same throughout. That's why the mass should be 50kg because we can fit people but the speed will be the same.
