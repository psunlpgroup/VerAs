The initial drop height of my roller coaster is 3.5 meters. This is because the higher the drop, the more potential energy you will have, that means there is more time for the cart to accelerate. The more potential energy you have, the more total energy you have. Having a decent amount of total energy will make it easier for the cart to make it over the hill, and loop. Although, you don't want the drop height to be too large, or else the ride won't be safe. 
For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.00 meters, the potential energy was 876 joules. When I increased the drop height to 3.00 meters, the potential energy increased to 1319 joules.
I am going to put my hill height lower than my drop height. The reason I am doing this is because the law of conservation states- no energy can be created nor destroyed. So that means after the initial drop, there is only enough energy made to make it over a hill either the same size, or smaller than the initial drop. This way, the cart will still be able to make it over the hill, and it will also be a fun roller coaster. 
When the PE turns to zero at the bottom, it doesn't just disappear. Instead it transfers into kinetic energy.
Also, the greater mass an object has, the more potential energy it will have. Because of that, I will be making the mass of the cart 50 kg. Mass doesn't really affect the speed, but the more mass something has, the more space there is for energy to be stored.
My ride will be very fun because all together, the total speed should reach about 8.27 m/s. This ensures that the ride will be fun, yet also safe for the riders.
