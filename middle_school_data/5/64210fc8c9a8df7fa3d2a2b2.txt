Mr and Mrs Gonzales you asked us to make you a roller coaster design that has safety while still being fun along with 1 initial drop, 1 hill and 1 loop and we made it happen.

Our team came to a decision about the drop height it will be 4.5 Meters. the reason we chose this is because at the 5 Meter drop the Roller coaster car was moving at a Speed of 9.89 Meters per second witch is unsafe for our riders. Along with the 5 Meter drop we tried a 4 Meter drop witch had the Roller coaster car moving at 8.84 Meters Per second witch was too slow for the aspect of fun. With that information we decided to meet in the middle between those two drop heights at 4.5 Meters witch had a Cart speed of 9.37 Meters per second witch was just right for the speed and safety aspects. This data shows how the height affects the energy by making more energy. The equation for PE is M times G times H is PE. and PE when going down the hill converts into KE and the equation for KE is 1/2M Times Velocity Squared so that means that when there is more Height witch means there is more PE witch converts into KE to make more velocity. 
Second we have to talk about our Hill and loop Heights because the total of our hill and loop heights has to equal less than our initial drop. height so we decided to have our hill height at 2 meters and our loop height at 2.25 Meters to make sure its fun.

thank you Mr and Mrs Gonzales for asking our team to make your roller coaster hope you like it.
