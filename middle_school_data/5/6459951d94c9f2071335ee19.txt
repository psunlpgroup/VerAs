Dear Gonzales Family,
 My proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my findings about
 the initial drop.  
The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.  This is important because the higher it is the more PE it will have.
For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.5m the PE was 1222J. When I increased the drop height to 5.00m, the PE increased to 2443J.
PE+KE =TE  my data supports this equation. In the  initial drop simulation my roller coaster had 1222J of PE at the top of the initial drop. It had 1222J of KE at the bottom of the initial drop, and it had 1222J of total energy at the end of the ride. 
The law of conservation of energy states that the energy you start with you end with the same number. This means that energy will go from PE energy to KE energy and back again throughout the ride.
Any hills that are added to the ride must be lower as compared to the initial drop height. 
You can see this in my data. When I tested a drop height of 5m and a hill height of 5m, the roller coaster car did not make it. However, when I tested a drop height of 5m and a hill height of 3m, the roller coaster car made it to the end. Our last experiment was comparing mass and energy. The higher the mass of the car, the higher the total energy. When I used a car that had a mass of 60 kg, the roller coaster had 2933J of total energy. When I used a car that had a mass of 58 kg, the roller coaster car had 2835j of total energy. In conclusion, from what weâ€™ve learned about the physics of roller coasters so far, your new roller coaster should have the following, It should be high of 5.00 for the initial drop and a high of 4.00 for the hill drop. A mass of 60 for the cart. The initial drop height should be 3.50 m. The lower the initial drop height, the less energy there will be. This initial drop height is also important to keep the ride safe. A drop height of 3.50m will give you a speed of 8.27 m/s. Any hills and loops that follow need to be lower than the initial drop height because they wouldn't be able to go over the hill or loopit would need t o have enough energy to go over the hill or loop.  For this reason, the hill height should be 2.75 m. Car mass will impact but not speed. I know this because when the mass was 52 kg, the energy was 1782 J and the speed was 8.27 m/s. However, when the mass was 48 kg, the energy was 1645 J and the speed was 8.27 m/s.
