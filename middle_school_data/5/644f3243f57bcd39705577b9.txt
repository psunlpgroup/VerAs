Dear the Gonzales famliy
I have made a conclusion as to what your roller coaster design will be like including ID height, Hill Height, and car mass. The final design includes an ID height of 3.5 meters, a Hill Height of 2.5 meters, and a car mass 50Kg. 
    When the mass increases the energy gets higher. The first 3 trials that I have for you are about mass and how it affects energy. For the car for trial 1, your car mass is 40kg and the amount of PE was 1564J. For trial 2 your car mass is 50kg the amount increased was1958. And lastly trial 3 your car mass is 55kg increasing potential energy to 2151. So you can see by my evidence that when you increase the car mass you increase the amount of energy. It's important to have enough PE that converts to KE so that you can make it through to the end of the track.
When the height increases the speed gets faster. The second 3 trials that I have for you are about height and how it affects speed. For the 1st trial, the initial drop is 2.50m and the amount of PE was 6.97J. For trial 2 the height of the initial drop was 3.54m the amount increased was 8.32J and for the last trial, the height of the initial drop is 3.74m increasing the same amount of J.
For your roller coaster trials, I have made you 3 trials for the speed of the bottom of the initial drop. For trial 1 the car speed was 8.12 at the bottom of the initial drop. For trial 2 the car's speed was 8.51 at the bottom of the initial drop. For trial 2 the speed of the car was 9.18 at the bottom of the initial drop. We also tracked the speed at the top of the hill so you could be safe enough at the top of the hill as well. In our first trial, the speed at the top of the hill was 4.56. In trial 2 the speed of the car at the top of the hill was 4.56. In trial 3 the speed of the car at the top of the hill was 3.36. We tracked the speed the car would also be going at the end of the ride. In trial 1 the speed of the car at the bottom of the hill was 8.12. In trial 2 the speed of the car at the end of the ride was 8.51. In trial 3 the speed of the car at the end of the roller coaster was 9.18. 
The speed at the bottom of the hill was always going to be faster than the speed at the top of the hill because if the speed at the top of the hill would be faster it would be unsafe for the passenger.
