 Making a fun and exiting roller coaster that makes sure of both fun and safety.    they can  make sure for a uninterrupted ride from start to finish. We looked at the relationships between the initial drop height and the hills heights. we want a exiting experience on the ride while maintaining the car's momentum. we also looked at the impact of the height of the initial drop and the mass of the car on the energy and speed of the ride. 

 changing the initial drop height of a roller coaster has a big  impact on the amount of energy the coaster has . The initial drop height directly influences the potential  energy of the roller coaster car at the start of the ride. The initial drop height is increased, the potential energy of the roller coaster car   increases. that means that the car has more possible energy at the beginning of the ride. when the car goes down the drop, this potential energy turns  into kinetic energy making a increase in the car's speed.


 change in mass of a roller coaster car directly affects its energy during the ride. The mass of the car is imprtant to the kinetic energy. When a roller coaster car starts to move down the drop the potential energy is turned into kinetic energy. The initial potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy as the car gains speed.

The gonzales family should pick my design because it is safe while being fun and exiting.
