Me and my design team have designed a roller coaster that is both fun and safe. Our initial drop is 5 meters. With   2500 joules of potential energy and then transfers into kinetic energy. Our car mass is currently 40 Kilograms. Adding more weight does not effect the speed or velocity of the roller coaster. But does effect how much potential and kinetic energy you get.

We also made sure that the coaster made it though each hill and loop with still enough potential energy to make it through the rest of the ride.

By having more mass towards you car you can get more potential energy at the top of the initial drop the more mass that you add to your coaster the more potential energy you will get.

When the coaster is at the top of the hill the potential energy converts or changes to kinetic energy. But the total amount of energy is always the same and does not change through out the ride.

Also when your hill or initial drop is higher you get more potential energy. Also when the Initial drop is the same height or taller then the hill the roller coaster will not make it over the hill. In a friction less environment.

Height and mass does not effect speed or velocity but does effect the amount of potential energy and kinetic energy.
