For one of my trials I did the drop height as 5 and 40 kg mass. The higher the height is, the more speed at the bottom, top, and end of ride there is. The KE and PE is greater when there's more speed. And to have more speed the drop height has to be higher. For mass, no matter if its a lot or a little, nothing changes. For example when I did 40 kg mass, it was 9.89 joules at the bottom, 6.23 joules at the top of hill, and 9.88 joules at the end. And all those numbers are the same exact when I changed the mass to 60 kg. The PE and KE stays the same too. PE is the energy when the cart is going up the roller coaster hill, at the top of the initial drop, or at the top of the hill before it goes down. And when it's going down that's when PE transfers into KE. The total energy is PE+KE and what that equals. But when the height is taller, the more PE there is before the drops.
