Dear, Gonzales family.

I have come up with a perfect coaster design to be built in your park. The roller coaster will have an initial drop height of 3.60 meters, this height will maximize the amount of speed the coaster can have without going over safety regulations but still having a speed that is fun and enjoy full. The height we have selected will give us a total of 2116 Jules of total energy. At the top of the drop, we should have a total of 2116 Jules of potential energy. When it goes down the drop the potential energy will turn into kinetic energy since energy is never created nor destroyed. We have placed a hill after the drop that has a height of 3.25 meters if the hill was any higher the cart would not have enough kinetic energy to get over the hill easily because you always need the hill to be smaller than the initial drop. The mass of the car is 60 kilograms which gives it a higher total amount of energy since the more mass there is the more energy there is. This will not affect the speed of the car since this is no friction and because mass cancels out. I look forward to building this roller coaster with you in the future.
