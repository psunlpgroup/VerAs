Dear Gonzales family, our engineering company has come up with all the numbers we need. The initial drop will be 3.25 meters. The hill height will be 2 meters. The car mass will be 50 kg. And finally, the loop height will be 2.5 meters.
	The reason for the initial drop is that it had to be taller than all of the other hills and loops. That is because the PE has to be greater than the energy needed to get over the hill and loop. And obviously, we want the car to get over the hill and loop. As we also know, the pe at the top of the ID was equal to TE at the bottom of the drop. Those two were also the same as TE at any given time. We made sure that we had some KE at all times on the coaster. Because of the law of conservation of energy, we knew that no energy would be lost in the coaster. For the hill, we tried to make it so that you had plenty of speed going over it. And we also had to make sure it didn’t exceed the height of the initial drop. Since the car mass doesn’t affect speed, we have that set to 50 kg. However, mass does affect energy, but that wasn’t as much of a concern. Since the main parameters were between 6.7 m/s and 8.4 m/s we made sure not to break those in the bottom of the ID and hill. That was another reason why we used the numbers that we did. We made sure to not go under. We also made sure that we didn’t go over. We did many tests to make sure all of the numbers worked together.
	There you have it those are the numbers that we gathered and found to work with what you wanted, was safe, and fun.
