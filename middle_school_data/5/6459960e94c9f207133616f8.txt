         Our roller coaster design features an initial drop followed by a series of hills. The design ensures that the roller coaster car will make it to the end of the ride without stopping by carefully considering the concepts of height, energy, and speed.
         Initial Drop: The roller coaster begins with a steep initial drop. This drop is essential as it provides the roller coaster car with a significant amount of potential energy. The higher the drop, the greater the potential energy gained by the car. As the car descends, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which propels the car forward. The data showed in the experiments backs up this statement, Since the drop height of 5m had a speed of 9.89 (m/s) at the bottom of the drop and a height of 3m only had a speed of 7.66 (m/s) at the bottom of the drop this states the higher the drop, the greater the potential energy gained by the car. As the car descends, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which propels the car forward.
        Conservation of Energy: The design of the roller coaster incorporates hills after the initial drop. These hills are strategically placed to take advantage of the conservation of energy principle. As the car approaches each hill, it carries a certain amount of kinetic energy. As it climbs the hill, this kinetic energy is gradually converted back into potential energy. This potential energy allows the car to overcome the force of gravity and continue moving forward.
       Speed and Momentum: The speed of the roller coaster car is crucial for maintaining momentum throughout the ride. To ensure a thrilling and enjoyable experience, our design carefully balances the height of the hills with the mass of the car. The higher the hill, the greater the potential energy gained, and consequently, the higher the speed of the car as it approaches the next hill. This speed helps to maintain the car's momentum, ensuring it can successfully navigate the track and reach the end of the ride.
       Safety Considerations: Safety is a paramount concern in roller coaster design. Our design takes into account several safety measures to ensure the Gonzales family's well-being. The track is carefully engineered with smooth curves and transitions to minimize abrupt changes in velocity or direction. Additionally, the roller coaster car is equipped with secure restraints, such as seat belts or over-the-shoulder harnesses, to keep passengers safely seated throughout the ride. The structural integrity of the track and support systems are thoroughly tested to ensure they can withstand the forces exerted by the car.
       By incorporating these scientific principles and design considerations, we can confidently assure the Gonzales family that our roller coaster design will provide a thrilling, safe, and enjoyable ride. The careful balance of height, energy, and speed will allow the roller coaster car to make it to the end of the ride without stopping, while ensuring the safety and excitement of the experience.
