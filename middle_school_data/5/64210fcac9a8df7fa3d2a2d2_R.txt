For our roller coaster, we decided that the initial drop would be 3.5, the hill would be 2, and the loop would be 2 as well. We decided on those numbers because the highest the speed could go was 8.3 and the max speed we can have is 8.4. The mass we decided on was 50, even though it doesn't really matter because the mass doesn't effect the speed. This is proven with our trials which showed that if the mass is 40 and if the mass is 60 they both have the same speed. The height we chose because if it was any higher it would have too much energy and would have too much speed. The higher something is the more PE it has, and on its way down it converts itself into KE. This is because of the law of conservation of energy which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. You can see this in the graphs as the car goes up and down hills, switching between KE and PE. Total energy is the PE and the KE added together. While the mass doesn't affect the speed, it does affect the energy. The higher the mass of the car is the more energy it has.
