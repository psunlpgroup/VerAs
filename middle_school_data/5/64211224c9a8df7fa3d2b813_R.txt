My height for the roller coaster is 3.05 m and the weight can be what ever the Gonzales family wants it to be. I have the height and mass set as this because the height is just at the point where it won't go to fast at the point where it's not safe but is still fun. The mass of the car can be whatever the Gonzales family wants because mass doesn't affect the speed. The greater the height the more PE the object will have due to it's position. The height will also make PE greater because it's further from the ground allowing it to drop for longer. The greater the height the more KE the object will have when reaching the bottom of the initial drop. The greater the height the more total energy because PE plus KE equals total energy. The greater the mass of the object has the more PE and KE it will have throughout the ride because of the energy being transferred from the car to the track and gravity acting upon that. Also PE and KE are related because they are both energy just PE is stored and KE is an energy in motion. The PE is transferred over to KE while moving down the roller coaster. Mass doesn't affect speed though because  the height will be the same no matter the mass which their will be the same amount of time for gravity to pull the object to the ground. The relationship between KE, PE and total energy is that PE is transferred to KE and both PE and KE transfer the energy to total energy. The law of conservation of energy affects my design by having the energy transferred through the car to the track and making the car go through the whole ride but is never creating or destroying energy.
