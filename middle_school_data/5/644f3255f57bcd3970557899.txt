Dear Gonzales family, 

My engineering company and I have come up with some initial ideas for measurements for the Initial Drop Height, Hill Height, Loop Height, and Car Mass. We feel that the ID Height should be 3.50m, the hill height 2.25m, the loop height 2.50m, and the car mass 50kg.

First, for the ID (initial drop) height, I did 3.50m. I did this because it's higher than the hill which it needs to be. The ID should be higher than the hill so that the car is able to make it through the ride. The relationship between ID height and hill height is that PE is always greater at the top of both of them and smaller at the bottom. This is because as height increases PE increases as well. Also when height decreases KE decreases as well. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3.50m, the PE was 1711J. When I increased the drop height to 4m, the PE increased to 1955J. As the ID height increases, PE and KE increase as well. PE at the top of the ID, KE at the bottom of the ID, and TE anywhere on the track are all 1711J. I also think 3.50m as ID height is good because it's not too high and it isn't extremely larger than the hill so it's safe. Another reason why it's safe is that it's under the limit of 8.4 m/s and greater than the limit of 6.7 m/s.

Secondly, for hill height, I did 2.25m. I did this because it's smaller than the ID which it needs to be. It needs to be smaller than the ID height because if it isn't, the car won't make it through the ride. I think 2.25m
 as the hill height is a good choice because it's not very very small compared to the ID so you won't go really fast to where it's dangerously fast. Also, 2.25m is between the limits of 8.4 and 6.7 m/s when it's at the bottom of the hill. For example, when I tested the hill height of 2.25m, the PE was 1104J. When I increased the hill height to 3m, the PE increased to 1473J. 

Thirdly, for the car mass, I did 50kg. I did this because the car won't go too fast but also won't go too slow. For example, when I tested the car mass of 50kg, the maximum speed was less than 8.4 m/s and greater than 6.7 m/s. When I increased the car mass to 60kg, it stayed the same when it was 50kg. That's because mass doesn't affect speed. The relationship between mass and energy is that mass does affect energy like PE, KE, and TE. For example, when I tested the car mass of 50kg, the PE was 1711J. When I increased the car mass to 60kg, the PE increased to 2053J. Regardless of the mass PE + KE always equals TE.

Lastly, for the loop height, I did 2.50m. I did this because it's smaller than the ID which it should be because if it wasn't the car wouldn't make it through the ride. For example, when I tested the loop height of 2.50m, the PE was 1224J. When I increased the loop height to 3.25m, the PE increased to 1593J. The loop height helps make the ride safe because it's smaller than the ID and greater than the hill so it won't go super fast to where it's really not safe. Also, the speed at the bottom of the loop is smaller than 8.4 m/s and greater than 6.7 m/s which are the limits.

I think my design is good for you guys because it reaches all the requirements while still being fun and safe.
