         Our roller coaster design features an initial drop followed by a series of hills. The design ensures that the roller coaster car will make it to the end of the ride without stopping by carefully considering the concepts of height, energy, and speed.
         Initial Drop: The roller coaster begins with a steep initial drop. This drop is essential as it provides the roller coaster car with a significant amount of potential energy. The higher the drop, the greater the potential energy gained by the car. As the car descends, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which propels the car forward. The data showed in the experiments backs up this statement, Since the drop height of 5m had a speed of 9.89 (m/s) at the bottom of the drop and a height of 3m only had a speed of 7.66 (m/s) at the bottom of the drop this states the higher the drop, the greater the potential energy gained by the car. As the car descends, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which propels the car forward.
        Conservation of Energy: The design of the roller coaster incorporates hills after the initial drop. These hills are strategically placed to take advantage of the conservation of energy principle. As the car approaches each hill, it carries a certain amount of kinetic energy. As it climbs the hill, this kinetic energy is gradually converted back into potential energy. This potential energy allows the car to overcome the force of gravity and continue moving forward.
       Speed and Momentum: The speed of the roller coaster car is crucial for maintaining momentum throughout the ride. To ensure a thrilling and enjoyable experience, our design carefully balances the height of the hills with the mass of the car. The higher the hill, the greater the potential energy gained, and consequently, the higher the speed of the car as it approaches the next hill. This speed helps to maintain the car's momentum, ensuring it can successfully navigate the track and reach the end of the ride.
       Safety Considerations: Safety is a paramount concern in roller coaster design. Our design takes into account several safety measures to ensure the Gonzales family's well-being. The track is carefully engineered with smooth curves and transitions to minimize abrupt changes in velocity or direction. Additionally, the roller coaster car is equipped with secure restraints, such as seat belts or over-the-shoulder harnesses, to keep passengers safely seated throughout the ride. The structural integrity of the track and support systems are thoroughly tested to ensure they can withstand the forces exerted by the car. 
The recommendations I would like to make to the Gonzales family are recommendations that are coming from data and energy analysis. All of the data collected are being recorded on behalf of the law of conservation of energy and mass. I would like to recommend and explain the science behind my team's current roller coaster design to help the Gonzales family have a fun, fast, and enjoyable roller coaster.

One of my recommendations that explains the science behind my current roller coaster refers to The law of conservation of energy states that within a closed system, energy can change form, but it cannot be created or destroyed. In other words, the total amount of energy remains constant. On a roller coaster, energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times over the course of a ride. Which leads to my recommendation, since energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times over the course of a ride. it would be great to have a car of a high mass so the amount of potential energy is more and the amount of kinetic energy that is produced is more. Looking at my data collected from the Mass and Energy testing, the car with the highest mass (60kg) has the most PE at the top of initial drop (J1468) and KE at the bottom of drop (J1413) which leads to the most total energy (J1468). This is a valid recommendation because we can compare the car at (60kg) to a car at (40kg) which only has (J978) of PE at the top the initial drop and (J978) of KE at the bottom of the drop and (J978) total energy. 

Another recommendation is that the greater the height, the more gravitational potential energy the roller coaster car has. Gravitational potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy if the car falls towards the ground. So, a large height could be a great thing for a roller coaster when wanting to add speed, and freight to a person riding it. Also, looking at Initial drop Data I can say that the greater release height leads to a greater gravitational potential energy that changes to a greater KE energy at the bottom of the drop, leading to more fun ride for riders. I say this because a release height of 5m has a PE of J2443 at the top of inital drop and a KE of J2442 at the bottom of initial drop and has J2443 of total energy. Comparing to a release height of 3m which has a J1466 of PE at the top of initial drop and J1465 of KE at the bottom of initial drop, which only has J1466 of total energy.

       By incorporating these scientific principles and design considerations, we can confidently assure the Gonzales family that our roller coaster design will provide a thrilling, safe, and enjoyable ride. The careful balance of height, energy, and speed will allow the roller coaster car to make it to the end of the ride without stopping, while ensuring the safety and excitement of the experience.
