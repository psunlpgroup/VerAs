the roller coaster that is best suited for the Gonzales family is a roller coaster that had an initial drop of 3.25, with a hill and a loop with the height of 2.25. this would be best suited for the Gonzales family. the height of the initial height affects the energy because of the potential energy, before the car drops it will hold PE. the more height the ID will have, the more PE and KE it will hold/store. the best way to guarantee that your cart will make it over a hill is to make the hill height smaller than the ID. if its  the same height or higher, the cart will not go over. changing the IDH will effect the speed because of the PE and KE. when the PE gets released into KE. the car will be faster from that. the change in the mass of a roller coaster cart will affect the energy. if a cart has less mass. the cart will have less energy, if the cart has more mass it will have more energy. the change in the mass of a roller coaster car doesn't affect the speed. if you change the mass from 40 - 60, the speed will be the same. the speed will only change if you change the initial drop. the relation ship between KE and PE is that they both equal to the total energy. at the start of the Initial drop. with a ride that has a initial drop of 3.25 and a hill or 2.25, this will make sure that the riders have a safe ride but also have a fast and fun ride.
