Dear Gonzales family,

Here is our roller coaster design. 

Firstly, we decided our initial drop height to be 3.5 meters because in our trials anything over 3.5 meters would be unsafe to ride. Also since we want our roller coaster to be fun and fast 3.5 meters seemed to have the most amount of energy, that is because height and total energy have a direct relationship. Next, we decided for our hill height to be 1.5 meters. This is because if the hill height went over the initial drop height the car wouldn't be able to get over the hill. After the hill, we included 2 loops. Their heights are 1.2 meters and .5 meters. We decided on this because they are less than the initial drop height (3.5 meters) resulting in having enough energy to complete the loops. The mass of the car will be 60 kg, we decided this because having this would guarantee the most amount of energy is used. However, this will not help make the car go any faster because mass and velocity do not have a relationship or they don't affect each other. For example, in one of our trials the mass of our car was 60 kg and the Total energy was 2932 J and when we tried with 50 kg the Total energy was only 2424 J. Height affects Potential energy, Kinetic energy and Total energy. Height and Potential energy have a direct relationship. You can see it in the formula; PE=mgh. Height and Kinetic energy have a direct relationship; KE =1/2 m v^2. Height affects Total energy because when the height increases so will the Total energy and when height decreases so will the Total energy. Height also affects the speed of the roller coaster by letting the car accelerate more because of gravity. The Law of Conservation of Energy affected our design decisions by being aware that energy can't be destroyed or created and helped us choose our hill and loop heights.
