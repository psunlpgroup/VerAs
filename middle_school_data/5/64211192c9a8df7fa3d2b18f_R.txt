Hello Gonzales family! My team has been working hard to design your park's safe and super fun roller coaster. We have done some experiments to ensure safety and I would like to present you with some of the data. The initial drop has to be larger than the hill height so the car can make it through the whole track. If the hill is to fight the car doesn't have enough energy to complete the whole track. The height affects the amount of Potential and Kinetic energy we have made it go faster or slower depending on the height. Potential energy is how much energy an object has based on its position at rest. Kinetic energy is how much energy the object has in motion. We have our initial drop at 3.25 meters and our hill at 2.25. We tested other heights and we found this to be the sweet spot. The higher we started the car track the more speed the car had at the bottom of the drop. The speed for the track maxed at 7.8 meters per second so it is fast but not too fast to cause potential injuries. The car's mass does not affect the speed, but it does affect the energy. When there is no friction the mass in the equations to calculate energy cancels out so it has no change to speed with a change to the mass. The mass of the car does give it more energy keeping it moving throughout the track due to the pull of gravity. The heavier the car the more stuff gravity has to pull down so it has more momentum to go back up the hill. In this simulation, there are 1905 joules of total energy for this roller coaster. The total energy is how much potential and kinetic energy there is in when added together. Since Energy can not be created or destroyed energy is always transferred. In our track, we ensure all factors keep our riders safe. I hope you like our design ideas thanks for your consideration.
