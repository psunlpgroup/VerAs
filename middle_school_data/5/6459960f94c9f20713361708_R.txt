       There are many things that make a roller coaster work. Gravity and hills have a big part in the coaster working. But you can also use mechanical systems to make it start then use gravity the rest of the way.
 
      The roller coaster Kingda Ka starts by launching you up a large hill then using the drop to gain speed to go the rest of the way. But normal coasters start off by slowly going up a hill then going down a steep hill to gain speed to go around the rest of the coaster.

   All roller coasters use energy but their are two types that make them work Potential energy and Kinetic energy. potential is when you are going up a hill and building up energy to drop and start going faster. kinetic is when the cart is moving and gaining speed usually down a hill.
 
   The best way to make a roller coaster is to make the first drop the tallest and the other hills smaller so that the cart can make it to the end. But if you make the other hills bigger than the first then there will not be enough energy and speed to make it to the end of the ride.

   So in all the best way to build a roller coaster is to make the first hill taller than the others so that the cart can build up enough energy to make it to the end of the ride.
