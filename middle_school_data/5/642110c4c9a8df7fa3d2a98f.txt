 I would recommend that you make the initial drop 3.5 meters cause then it will give the rollercoaster enough energy to go over the hill. It is also the highest that you can make it while being safe and fun. I made the hill height 2 meters because it has to be shorter than the initial drop to go over but then also still a fun hill to go over. I made the loop 1 meter because otherwise, it would have the energy to go over but not much so it will be enough to make it still fun and safe. I made the last little hill only 0.3 meters so then it was kinda a fun and chill way to end the ride. I made the mass of the car 60 so then it will stay on the tracks and not feel like you are going to be thrown out of your seat. The reason I chose the heights that I did was that they were the safe options and still make the ride safe and fun for the riders. The relation between the PE KE and TE is all tied together because the PE and KE transfer back and forth and then that doesn´t affect the TE because the TE is the same no matter what. The height will affect the KE and PE by how high it is the higher the drop the more PE and KE you will have in your ride but remember you have to keep it at 3.5 meters or lower. The mass of the car won´t affect the speed no matter what you could have a full cart of passengers or an empty cart and the speed would be the same. You also have to consider how high the drop is cause it can´t be too tall cause then it would exceed the speed limit of 160 or 8.4 and has to be faster than 127 or 6.4.
