       I will be talking about the most fun and safe roller coaster design for the Gonzales family. the roller coaster will have a 2.75m initial drop. It will also have a 2.72m loop and then a 2m hill directly after the loop.
       the height of the initial drop is 2.75. this is because it needs to be taller than the 2.72m loop and the 2m hill so it can make it over. Another reason the height of the initial drop is 2.75 is that it can't be too high or else it will be too fast and the rider will not survive. the higher the initial drop the more speed and energy there is. my data proves this because it states that 2.75 has a max speed of 7.33m/s. that is safe but still fast enough to be fun.
       Mass does not affect the ride of the roller coaster. the mass does not change the speed and to prove that my data states a 40kg, 47kg, 54kg, and a 60kg car all went 7.33 m/s 
       The total energy is the sum of the Kinetic and potential energy. The sum of Kinetic and potential energy will always equal the total no matter what due to the law of conservation. The law of conservation states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
       all these reasons show why my roller coaster is the most fun and safe design.
