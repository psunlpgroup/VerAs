Today I am going to be telling you why you should buy our roller coaster.There is a lot of reasons why you should buy from us.


The drop height of my roller coaster design is 3.5 meters.This is because anything higher than 3.5 it will go over 8.4 and that is when roller coasters get dangerous and we want to provide you with a safe and fun thrilling coaster.For example when I tested the drop height of 3.75 meters it went to 8.6 and that is not safe.When I tried 3 it was 8.2 so I went to 3.5 and it was 8.3.


I tested 4 test runs.My first one was 5 and the speed was 9.88.So I decreased to 4.5 and the speed was 9.32.So I decreased again to 3.75 and the speed was 8.5.So I did 3.5 and got 8.3 which is safe enough to ride.


I decided on the mass being 60 kg.I tested 4 different masses.My first one was 40 and it was 8.21 speed.My second one was 48 and it was 8.25 speed.My third one was 54 and it was 8.27 speed and my final one was 60 and it was 8.27.I figured out mass doesn't affect the speed if it drops from the same height.


The relationship between KE in PE and total energy depends on the height of the drop. Because there will always be 0 KE and the PE depends on the height of the drop.If it is to small it will have less but the bigger the drop the more PE it has.The energy also transfers from KE to PE.This is from the law of conservation means nothing can be destroyed of created just transferred from one and another.


Whenever you add more mass you get more PE and total energy.With more mass means the roller coaster will have more potential to go faster and adds more thrill.The relationship between drop height and hill height is that the drop height has to be bigger than the hill or the coaster won't go over the hill.


When I found the total energy there was a certain amount of energy for PE and no energy for KE.I added up PE and KE and it should equal the initial amount of PE at the start.And it never transfer because there is friction.That is how you get your total energy.


Thank you Gonzalez family for reading my essay on why you should buy my coaster.
