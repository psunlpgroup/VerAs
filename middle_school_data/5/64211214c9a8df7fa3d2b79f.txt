Dear Gonzalez family, Me and my team have designed a roller coaster that is not only safe but fun. We have done some trials and found that mass will not affect the speed of the roller coaster unless friction is present. We know this because we did a trial where we dropped a 60kg cart down the hill and it had the same amount of energy as the 40kg cart. But, we have determined that we need the drop to be around 4 or less than 4 meters tall or there will be too much speed. This will be unsafe for the riders because the g-force will be so intense it could hurt the passengers. The taller the drop the more potential energy there will be. This is because, the height allows gravity to act upon the object faster. We also know that the more potential energy there is, the more kinetic energy there will be. This allows the cart to go faster when it has a higher drop. From our observations we have gathered that the potential energy and kinetic energy rely on the total energy. When potential energy goes up, kinetic energy goes down and vise versa. This shows that we need tho have the right amount of total energy to have a ride with enough kinetic energy to get over the hills. Because of this observation the law of conservation of energy is factored into out design. We know that energy can not be created nor destroyed. So when we designed out initial drop we looked at the amount of energy it had at the beginning and knew it would be the same amount at the end. I hope this is helpful for you to understand why we designed our roller coaster the way we did and we will continue to change and update our design.
