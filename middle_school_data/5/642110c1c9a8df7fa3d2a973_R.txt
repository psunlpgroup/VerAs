Hello, this rollercoaster is going to be amazing, and we can't wait to show you. Firstly, the height and potential energy had a great impact on our roller coaster. We know this because height has a direct relationship with potential energy. Next, we know that potential energy has a direct relationship with Kinetic energy, because the higher the potential energy, the higher the kinetic energy, and vice versa. To add to that, we know that total energy is kinetic energy and potential energy combined, when either kinetic energy and potential energy lessen, then so does the total energy. Also, when the car goes down the hill, the potential energy starts to transfer into kinetic energy, and when it goes back up the hill, the kinetic energy changes into potential energy. The relationship between drop height and hill height is direct because if you make the initial drop higher, then the kinetic energy is greater. This means that the car would get over the hill faster, and the hill must be shorter than the initial drop if you want the car to make it to the end of the ride. The Conservation of energy means that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, this is backing up what I said about how the initial drop must be higher than the hill heights. Mass and energy also have a direct relationship, because when you make mass larger, it has more energy, and when you make it smaller, it has less energy. Next, we learned that the higher the hill height, the more speed you will get, and the less height you have, the less speed. This means that height and speed have a direct relationship. Finally, we know that mass and speed have an indirect relationship, meaning that if you make the mass greater or smaller, the speed does not change. With all of this knowledge, we decided to have an initial drop of 3.5 meters, a loop of 2.5 meters tall, a hill of 2 meters tall, and a final hill height of 2.5 meters tall, and finally, the car's mass will be 50 kg.
