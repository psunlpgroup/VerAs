Dear, Gonzalez family.

I have been working on the roller coaster for your amusement park and this is what I think you should do and why.

The first point of business is the mass of the car and I think you should go with a 50 kilogram car because mass doesn't affect speed. Also we can get a good amount of energy because the more mass an object has the more energy it also has. Since the TE is the amount of energy on the track transferring from PE to KE on the coaster. 

Then the initial drop should be 3.5 meters because of the law of conservation of energy which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Meaning that in order for our coaster to make it over the hills and loops later on it has to get more energy from the initial drop than it takes for it to get over the hill. So if we go will a shorter initial drop we will have to have little things later on. The second reason why I chose a 3.5 meter drop is because it's a height you have a thrilling speed But it's also safe going at 8.3 meters a second which is just under the dangerous speed at 8.4 meters a second.

The next thing is the loop and I think you go with a 3 meter height. Again because law of conservation of energy (energy cannot be created nor destroyed) which means we need to have a smaller loop that the initial drop. The reason is because we need enough energy and it's still a fun height where you reach a speed of 7.65 meters per second.

Now we have the hills in the track and the first one should be 2.5 meters. So we can get a gain of speed for the next hill and that should be 3 meters to end the ride
