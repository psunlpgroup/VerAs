Dear Gonzales Family,
For my coaster, I will be using a drop height of 3.5m, because it makes for a fun ride, gets to the end, and stays under 8.4m/s throughout the ride. The reason this drop height works, is due to the fact that it now has enough potential energy to make it to the end of the ride, but not too much where it will be unsafe or go above the limit of 8.4m/s. The higher the drop height, the higher the speed of the car will get. This is because when you have a higher PE the KE and speed go up because PE converts into KE as long as there is no friction. I will be adding a loop because it adds to the thrill, and the height of the loop will be 3m, as it can then make it all the way around at a good, fun, and safe speed, with no issues. Where when I tried it with a loop height of 5, the car did not have enough KE or speed to make it around the whole loop. After the loop, there will be a hill with a height of 3.25m, because since it is under 3.5 meters (the initial drop) it will have enough KE to make it over the hill. You could make the car any mass you would like
 because the mass does not affect the overall speed of the coaster. The total energy is the sum of PE and KE. For example, when I used a mass of 40, my bottom-of-initial drop speed, top-of-hill speed, and end-of-ride speed were consistent. For this particular project, I will be using a mass of 50kg, because I think it is a happy medium and will make for a safe yet fun experience. The Law of Conservation of Energy is the reason we have these rules for our coasters and also shows how and why it is important to follow them. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects our coasters because when a component of the formula for PE, KE, velocity, and lots of other things is changed, it alters the outcome of the speed or other important parts of the coaster.
