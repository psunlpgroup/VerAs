I believe that 3.5 meters is the best initial drop height. From my evidence 3.5 meters was had the fastest and safest speed of 8.27 m/s. I also believe that any mass could be used since mass does not effect how fast a  car goes. From my research a 40 kg car has the same speed as a 60 kg car of 7.65 m/s. Mass effects KE, PE and TE, from my research a 60 kg car had more PE then a 40 kg car with 1422 J. Height effects PE, KE and TE. Height changes PE, KE, TE and speed, from my research every time a 5 meter drop increased TE and speed more then a shorter initial drop height total energy is PE and KE added up altogether. The law of conservation of energy states that energy is transferred and not created or destroyed. Using the law of conservation of energy when a car is up on a hill the car's KE transferred into PE, and when going down a hill the PE transferred into KE. Using the law of conservation of energy we have to have the right amount of energy because we cannot create any energy.
