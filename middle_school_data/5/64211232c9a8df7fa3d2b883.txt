After running tests on using different heights and weights I have figured out the perfect height and mass of the cart and initial drop. For the initial drop your height will be 3.5  because its not going to make your ride to slow and boring for your customers or to fast and dangerous for people to ride. The cart mass can be anywhere between 40-60kg because whenever you set your cart mass, the speed of the ride will always be the same looking at my trials. PE and KE added together make the total energy and if you keep your initial drop at 3.5 the PE will still stay the same because of the drop height.
