The height of the initial drop should be  4 meters tall because it is not too high or too low.For all the test runs I have tested with the initial drop height to be 4 the speed at the end of the roller coaster ha been over 6 at least.The height of the hill should  be 3 because the height has to be lower than the initial drop height so the car can make it over the hill.Lowering the hill height to 3.5 is not too low and not too high,it will give yo the best and most fun amount of speed.The height of the loop should be 2.75 because it should be lower than the hill so it has enough PE to make it around the whole loop.The way i decided on these heights was because each hill or loop has to be lower than what was right before itself so it can make it around the loop,or get over the hill.The mass of the car should be 55 kg because using my data 40,45,52 have less speed at the top of the initial drop and he hill.The hill height has to be the highest point so it can have the greatest amount of PE to make the cart all the way through the roller coaster,and s it can use the law of conservation of energy.The relationship between KE and PE is KE is greatest at the lowest point and PE is greatest at the highest point,that is a indirect relationship because when PE goes up KE goes down,same way around.The greater the height is the more PE the lower the height the more KE.The hill height should be between 3-4 because it works the best when the drop height is a little bit bigger than the hill so the car can use the law of conservation of energy.Also the car can accelerate up the hill and loop.The more mass there is the more energy.the relationship between drop height and the hill height is that the drop has to be bigger or the same height as the hill otherwise the car will not make it over the hill.The relationship between KE and PE is a indirect because when the PE at the top of the hill when the cart is going down the PE also goes decreases while the KE increases.The more mass there is the more energy there will be the relationship is a direct relationship because  both increase or decrease.mass doesn't effect speed height does.
