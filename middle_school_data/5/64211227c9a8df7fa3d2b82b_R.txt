We will have the initial drop as 3.5 meters so the ride isn't too fast but fast enough to be still fun at a quick but safe speed(8.26 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop). And we will have the height of the hill 2.5m so the hill won't be too high to get up but have an exciting drop at the end. 

The height of the initial drop will affect the PE because the cart will have more built-up energy before dropping down. After all, it will drop down further. Then it will affect KE because the PE will not be in place anymore and switch over the KE because its energy is in motion and the more KE the more speed there will be. 

The cart's mass doesn't affect any energy or speed because it is a frictionless environment.

When the cart is on the top of the hill before it drops down it will build up PE energy because it is not moving then as it drops down the initial drop it will transfer the KE energy because its energy is in motion. The total energy will not change because energy cannot be destroyed or created in the object only transferred to different kinds of energy. For example, when a cart goes down the initial drop when there is friction your not losing your total energy it's just transferring to thermal energy.
