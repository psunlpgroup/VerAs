I choose the height of the initial drop to be 3.25 because it made the coaster stay between 6.7 - 8.4 while it was going down the hills and at the bottom. Height affects PE because you multiply height with gravity and mass to achieve the potential energy the higher the drop, the more potential energy it has. Height does not affect KE because it is not a part of the equation for KE, 1/2xmxv^2. Mass affects both PE and KE because mass is in both of their equations. PE is the energy that could happen or will happen while KE is the energy that is happening. At the top of the initial drop, the PE is the same as the total energy. PE transfers energy to KE while going down the hill, but all the while the energy of the two added still equals the total energy, this is in a frictionless world. In a friction world, some of the energy may change into thermal energy. The sum of the energy together is the total energy. The total energy is how you describe the thermal energy, potential energy, and kinetic energy in one word. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy will be created or destroyed. Just because the PE shrinks as we go up the hill does not mean it is gone, it may have turned into thermal or kinetic energy. Speed does not change based on the mass of an object because gravity is what cause the speed of an object to fall. The speed will depend on the drop height of the coaster because the drop height is a part of the equation for KE which directly correlates to the speed. The initial drop must be higher than the hill height so the roller coaster cart has enough energy to get back up the hill.
