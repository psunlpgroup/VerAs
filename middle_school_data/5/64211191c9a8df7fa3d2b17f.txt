The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because each gain in height corresponds to the loss of speed as kinetic energy due to speed is transformed into potential energy due to height. Each loss in height corresponds to a gain of speed as potential energy due to height is transformed into kinetic energy due to speed. For example, when i tested the drop height of 3.54 meters, the speed of my roller coaster car was 8.32 m/s. When i increased the drop height to 4.10 meters, the speed increased at 8.90 m/s. Then i increased the drop height to 5 meters to get 9.89 m/s to get better speed. I chose this data because i want it to have a similar structure that i designed it to be. Based on my data points i want it to be fast and safe and enjoyable for the roller coaster. The kinetic energy of the object will be higher if the object is placed at a greater height. Potential energy isn't transferrable, it depends on the height or distance and mass of the object. Mass and kinetic energy have a positive relationship, which means that as mass increases, kinetic energy increases, if all other factors are held constant.The mechanical energy of an object can be the result of its motion. Which means the total amount of mechanical energy is merely the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. In other words, the total amount of energy remains constant. On a roller coaster, energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times over the course of a ride.
