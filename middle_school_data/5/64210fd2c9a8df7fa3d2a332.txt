Are inertial drop height is five. We chose this because if we have mass that is a little less then the other roller coasters, it will make for a fun, safe and fast ride, but do not worry,, we will not have a speed go over the limit. This mass will be fifteen. I noticed Potential Energy (PE) and Kentic Energy (KE) was also one of your worries. But to put into simple terms, PE and KE together make total energy which impacts the speed. The PE, KE and total energy can never start if the object is at rest, which is Newtons first law stated "An object at rest must remain at rest unless a force is pushing onto it." The relationship between PE and KE is in more detail is the cars go to the next hill, some kinetic energy is transformed into the  potential energy. Then, when the cars down the hill, potential energy would changed to kinetic energy. At the top of the hill, PE will start to realize due to the mass of gravity pushing back, and the weight of the roller coaster. So if we start the coaster at a slow rate, it will make the energy save, and cause a faster, safer and better outlook on the coaster. The loop and Hill height will be 3 for both, the hill being right after the drop. This is because the mass of the cart going down will make it go over the hill with enough energy to go down and through the lop.
