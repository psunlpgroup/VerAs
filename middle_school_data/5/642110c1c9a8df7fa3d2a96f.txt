Dear Gonzales family, 

I created a new roller coaster for you because I am a good boy. The higher we make the initial drop the higher the hill following the initial drop can be as long as it is shorter than the drop. the more kinetic energy there is the more kinetic energy there will be and we could make the roller coaster go faster. the total energy at the end of the roller coaster could be higher if the height was raised. no matter what when the car reaches the top of the first hill the kinetic energy will drop and the potential energy will increase and make it so that the cart can make it over another hill. in order for the car to make it over the hill the initial drop needs to be higher the the hill height, the more the cart weighs the more energy the cart will have as it goes down the hill.
the speed of an object is only affected by friction because the gravitational pull in always the same. so if there is not friction everything would fall at the same speed and not ever change. this is also why when you drop a piece of paper and a basketball the basketball will hit the ground first. but if you crumple up the paper then they will hit the ground at the same time. Therefore I will make the mass 50 kg because it does not have any effect on the speed.
