     Dear Gonzales family, 
The height for your initial drop for your rollercoaster is 3.5m tall we decided to make the initial drop 3.5m tall because it is the maximum height we can go for the element of fun without endangering your passengers. The next part a loopty loop is 2.5m tall we choose this so the cart would regain more potential energy. Then you will have 2 hills the smaller one being 2m tall this way you have a smaller hill leading to a bigger hill making it seem like you go up and up and up and the bigger one is 2.5m tall that way right before the end you will have a steep drop. Next is the mass of your car the mass will be 50kg the perfect balance for speed. The height at the beginning is important because you will need it to create a higher Potential energy which will transfer to Kinetic energy. The energy in this ride will only transfer it can't be created or destroyed so if it starts with 50 J of Potential energy it will transfer to 50 J of kinetic energy at the end
