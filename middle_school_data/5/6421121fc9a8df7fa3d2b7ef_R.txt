Dear Gonzagas family after the last few weeks we have completed our research for your new rollercoaster. Our initial drop height that we have decided on is 3.5 meters. We chose 3.5 meters because the drop's bottom speed was 8.27 m/s which will give the ride a fun but safe speed. Also, a higher initial drop will have an increased amount of energy. This is due to the equation Mass x Height x Acceleration due to gravity = KE. So if you increase the height the outcome will be higher too and more KE means that there has the potential to be more PE. We know this because, in the conservation of energy, energy can't be created or destroyed. Our hill height will be 2.5 meters because the hill has to be shorter than the initial drop. After all, the initial drop is the starting point with the most energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be made or destroyed. So the car will not gain energy as it goes up the hill. We propose the loop height to be 3 meters because the loop will still be shorter than the initial drop. This means that the car will have enough energy to make it around the hoop. The car mass should be 60 kg because we know mass doesn't affect the since in our multiple tests. We found out the car mass could be 60 or 40 and the speeds stayed the same. But a larger car mass will cause the PE and KE to increase. This is because of the equations Mass x Height x Acceleration by gravity = KE and the equation 1/2 Mass x Velocity squared = PE. This shows that the more mass there is the more energy there will be due to one variable going which causes the product to go up. The total energy is the sum of all the energy being applied to an object. So for the roller coaster, the PE + KE + friction energy is equal to the total energy.
