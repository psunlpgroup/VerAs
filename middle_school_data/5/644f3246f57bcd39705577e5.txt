Dear Gonzalas family I have a design that is a fun and fast but safe rollercoaster. So let's get started well the max speed before the coaster gets unsafe is 8.4 m/s and this coaster only has a little less 8.36 out of 8.4 m/s. We have it at 3.58 for the initial drop, which gives it more speed and a good decline for the track of the PE on the ID 1747 which is the same as the KE at the bottom of the ID 1747. The TE total energy will always be the same at 1747 because of the KE and PE which I mentioned earlier. Now for the speed, there is no speed at the top of the ID. On the bottom of the ID, the rate is 8.36 it will be this on the lowest points of the ride. Now for hill height, the height will be at 2.5 which will be enough to get the car over the hill and to the loop. The speed at the top of the hill will be 4.56 smaller than the speed at the bottom of the ID because the car is going uphill instead of going downhill. Now for the Loop Height which is the last part of the track. The height will be at 2 will be enough to make it over to the end of the ride. Last is the car mass which will be 50g enough to make the car safe and fun to ride on. In case you were wondering the car mass would not affect the speed of the car because mass does not affect speed. The track will be a safe and fun option for families everywhere.
