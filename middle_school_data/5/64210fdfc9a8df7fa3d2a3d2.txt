Dear Gonzales Family,

I have successfully created a safe and fun roller coaster. Here is why. I decided that the mass of the cart should be 55 kg and that the height of the initial drop should be 3 m. The height effects both PE and KE as well as total energy and speed. PE effects height as the cart goes down the initial drop. The PE turns into KE, which effects the speed, which effects the total energy.The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is also important. When the cart goes down the initial drop, PE turns into KE which effects the total energy. This also relates to the Law of Conservation of Energy which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Instead of PE disappearing altogether it turns into KE which changes the total energy. Mass also effects PE, KE, and total energy but it doesn't effect the speed. Thank you for this opportunity!
