Dear Gonzales family, 

My school has been researching ways to build a roller coaster. Here are my suggestions on how to make a fun and safe roller coaster. The first thing with building a roller coaster is the initial drop of the roller coaster has to be taller than the hill height. This is because if the drop is lower than the hill there will not be enough PE to make it to the end of the ride. 
       Also the higher the initial drop height depends on the PE and KE of the ride. I know this because when I was collecting data while doing the sim the higher the initial drop the more PE , KE and total energy there will be. As the coaster car goes down the hill the PE goes down and the KE starts going up.  
       Another thing we have been discussing is the speed the roller coaster has to go to be fun but also safe at the same time. In my data I found that the initial drop has to be a little bigger then the hill height for it to be safe and not go too fast. Also for making and having the coaster car the mass of it won't matter or affect the speed that the ride will go. Meaning if the car is 60 kg it will go the same speed as the car that is 40 kg. 
    Also the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can neither be created or destroyed only converted from one form of energy to another.
