This is how i would create a safe, fun and exciting roller coaster. I will make my drop height 5. By making the drop height 5, the speed at the bottom of the drop will be 9.85 and have a speed of 4.92 at the top of the hill. With this the speed at the end of the ride will be 9.8 creating a safe and fun ride the heigher the drop height the more speed. For the mass of the cart we chose 45 we chose this mass because when we tested a mass of 40 we got a speed of 8.90 at the bottom of the drop. We also tested 50 and got a speed of 8.79. Mass doesnt change the speed of the cart so we chose to use 45. When creating height for our drop height we needed to make a heigher to create more PE and KE so the cart could get over the hill. We chose to use a drop height of 5 so we had a greater PE and KE resulting in a greater total energy. The relationship between PE and KE is that they create total energy. PE and KE also transfer throughout the ride, then coming together at the end to create total energy. The law of conservation affected our design by forcing us to add restrants so the cart wouldnt go to crazy and to fast where is was not safe. The ride is safe with a safe drop height and restrants that allow the ride to go on steadally. Being a safe, fun, and exciting ride for all!
