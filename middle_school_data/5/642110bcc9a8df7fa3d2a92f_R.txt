Dear Gonzales Family,

I have been working on the final blueprints for the roller coaster design that I'm going to share with you. The initial drop height should be about 3.5 m, as it provides enough speed to ensure that the ride is safe, while still making it fun for the riders. The hill height should be 3 m,  &  the loop height should be about 2 m so that the car has enough energy to make it to the end of the ride, while the loop provides a thrilling experience. The car mass should be 60 kg, as it provides more PE at the top of the initial drop, and it isn't too light; the  speed could reach dangerous levels that way. The heavier the car is, the less energy it will have, and the lighter the car, the more energy it will have. During the trials, I determined that the heights of the initial drop, hill and loop should have the proposed heights as they ensure that the ride has a safe speed ( about 8.4 m/s), while still providing a fun experience for the riders, which is the ultimate goal. When you're deciding on speed for your roller coaster, it's important that you consider what speeds are safe & provide a fun experience for your riders, and which ones do not. Since there is no relationship between mass and speed, the speed will stay the same throughout the ride. To continue, there is a direct relationship between mass and PE. When the mass increases, the PE increases. When the roller coaster car reaches the bottom of the drop, all of that PE is converted to KE. So, there is a direct relationship between mass & KE as well. The total energy, or TE, is the PE & KE combined. Since the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be destroyed once it has been created, the TE will change if more PE & KE are added. All of these factors are vital contributors to making the ride fun and safe.
