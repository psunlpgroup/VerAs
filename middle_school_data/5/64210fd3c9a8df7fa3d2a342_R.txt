This is how i would create a safe, fun and exciting roller coaster for the Gonzales family. 

I will make my drop height 5. By making the drop height 5, the speed at the bottom of the drop will be 9.85 and have a speed of 4.92 at the top of the hill. With this the speed at the end of the ride will be 9.8 creating a safe and fun ride the higher the drop height the more speed. For the mass of the cart we chose 45 we chose this mass because when we tested a mass of 40 we got a speed of 8.90 at the bottom of the drop. We also tested 50 and got a speed of 8.79. Mass doesn't change the speed of the cart so we chose to use 45. When creating height for our drop height we needed to make a higher to create more PE and KE so the cart could get over the hill. We chose to use a drop height of 5 so we had a greater PE and KE resulting in a greater total energy. The relationship between PE and KE is that they transfer from each other throughout the ride. PE and KE also come together at the end of the ride to create total energy  When creating our drop height of 5 we knew that the higher the drop height the more PE that would be created. The law of conservation affected our design by telling us that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. So by adding mass there was no change to our roller coaster. We had to find other ways to make our design safe and fun. 

The ride is safe with a safe drop height and restraints that allow the ride to go on stead-ally. Being a safe, fun, and exciting ride for all!
