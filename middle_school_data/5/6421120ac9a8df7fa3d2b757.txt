Dear the Gonzalez Family, my name is Jackson and I will be telling you what the best height and mass for your roller coaster to insure that there will be safety and a lot of fun. For the initial drop height of the ride I would recommend a height of around 3.5. I think 3.5 is the best height because based on my data, when I used a drop height of 3.5 the speed of the car was 8.27. This shows that 3.5 is the best drop height because the car is going very fast but not over the speed of 8.4 where it could hurt people on the ride. For the mass of the car I think the best mass is 50 because the car isn't too light or too heavy. In my data trials when I used a car mass of 60 and a car mass of 40, the results of the PE and KE were the same even though the masses were completely different. This shows that the mass of the car doesn't really affect the PE, KE, TE, or speed of the car.  This is true based on my data trials where I used a few different masses and the speed was the same for all of them even though the drop and hill height were all the same. Next, the height of the initial drop affects the PE because the higher the drop is the more PE there will be because the car is higher up from the ground. Also, the more PE you have the more KE you will have because the PE transfers into KE as the car goes down the track. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy where energy cannot be created nor destroyed. The Law of Conservation affects my design because I knew that the more PE there was the more KE there would be because energy cannot be created nor destroyed. This means that the PE at the top would be the same number as the KE at the bottom. I hope you guys take some of my info  and use it to design your new roller coaster. Bye.
