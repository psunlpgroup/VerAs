Dear Gonzales family,
I did more experimenting and found that the mass of the car does not matter. the initial drop height still needs to be higher than everything else so that the car has enough KE to make it to the end of built-up PE. In order for this coaster to be fun there must be loops and turns and such. it will start with an initial drop of 5.00 meters. Then go to a loop at a height of 4.5 meters. the loop height must be lower than the initial drop height. then it will go into an up-and-down track at a height of 4 meters. then it will finish off by going back up and around. this will have a height of 3.5 meters. 

The mass of the car will have to be 50 KG. although it doesn't matter I figured i would put it in there. The friction will have to be 0 as well. now in order for this car to get enough speed and the riders to get back safely we will have to do a car holding 10 people at a time to add up to this mass of 50 KG. 

Well Gonzales family, I hope this helps you with your roller coaster. have a good time riding!
