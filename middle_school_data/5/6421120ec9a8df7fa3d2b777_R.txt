Dear Gonzales family. Based off of our research we have discovered that mass dose not affect PE and KE. Because gravity always affects objects at the gravitational pull of 9.8  no matter the mass. For the height of the initial drop should be 3.50 m so then the ride is safe for park guests.Height affects PE and KE because the higher the car is the more time gravity has to fully affect the car with the 9.8 gravitational pull.This affects the KE because gravity pulls the car down and it gains more velocity and speed.The PE is affected because there is more gravity pulling on the car to give the car more PE.The transfer between energy is important to because  when the car starts moving it looses PE and gains KE but when the car stops at the top of a hill for example.The car gains PE because the energy transfers depending on where the car is  on the tracks.And the higher we drop the car then  the more speed it will get because gravity has more time to affect the car.and the total energy is the greatest amount of energy the car has throughout the ride
