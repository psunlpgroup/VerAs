Dear Gonzales Family, 

My engineering company and I have come up with some initial ideas for measurements for the Initial Drop Height, Hill Height, Loop Height, and Car Mass. We feel that the ID Height should be 3.50m, the hill height 2.25m, the loop height 2.50m, and the car mass 50kg.

First, for the ID (initial drop) height, I did 3.50m. I did this because it's higher than the hill which it needs to be so that the car is able to make it through the ride. The relationship between ID height and hill height is that PE is always greater at the top of both of them and smaller at the bottom. This is because as height increases PE increases as well. Also when height decreases PE decreases as well. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3.50m, the PE was 1711J. When I increased the drop height to 4m, the PE increased to 1955J. As the ID height increases, PE and KE increase as well. PE at the top is equal to KE at the bottom. PE at the top of the ID, KE at the bottom of the ID, and TE anywhere on the track are all 1711J. I also think 3.50m as ID height is good because it's safe and fun. For example, the max speed which is 8.3 m/s is under the limit of 8.4 m/s and greater than the excitement limit of 6.7 m/s. 

Secondly, for hill height, I did 2.25m. I did this because it's smaller than the ID which it needs to be, because if it isn't, the car won't make it through the ride. For example, when I tested the hill height of 3.75m, the car didn't make it through the ride. I think 2.25m as the hill height is a good choice because the maximum speed at the bottom of the hill is 8.27 m/s, and this is between the limits of 8.4 m/s and 6.7 m/s. As hill height increases, PE increases and vice versa. For example, when I tested the hill height of 2.25m, the PE was 1104J. When I increased the hill height to 3m, the PE increased to 1473J. 

Thirdly, for the car mass, I did 50 kg. When I tested the car mass of 50 kg, the maximum speed was 8.3 m/s, which was less than 8.4 m/s and greater than 6.7 m/s. When I increased the car mass to 60 kg, the maximum speed stayed the same (8.3 m/s) as when it was 50 kg. When I decreased the car mass to 40 kg, the maximum speed stayed the same (8.3 m/s) as when the car mass was 50 kg. That's because mass doesn't affect speed. The relationship between mass and energy is that mass does affect energy like PE, KE, and TE. For example, when I tested the car mass of 50 kg, the PE was 1711J. When I increased the car mass to 60 kg, the PE increased to 2053J. When I decreased the car mass to 40 kg, the PE decreased to 1369J. Regardless of the mass, PE + KE always equals TE.

Lastly, for the loop height, I did 2.50m. I did this because it's smaller than the ID which it needs to be, because if it isn't, the car won't make it through the ride. For example, when I tested the loop height of 3.75m, the car didn't make it through the ride. When I tested the loop height of 3.50m, the car also did not make it through because it is the same height as the ID. I think 2.50m as the loop height is a good choice because the maximum speed at the bottom of the loop is 8.27 m/s, and this is between the limits of 8.4 m/s and 6.7 m/s.

I think my design is good for you guys because it reaches all the requirements while still being fun and safe.
