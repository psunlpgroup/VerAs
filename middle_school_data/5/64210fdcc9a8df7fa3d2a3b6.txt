In our groups design we made the initial drop height 3.5 meters, and the hill height 2.5 meters while the cart being 50 kilograms. We were able to make our ride fun, but also safe at the same time. We chose these heights because they made it so the ride was going fast enough so it was fun (8.3 m/s) but just slow enough so it was still safe for the riders. The height affected the PE because it was still pretty high to the point where it would have a good amount of joules of energy to go fast. And also to have enough PE at the top of the initial drop and make it to the top of the hill with the amount of KE the ride had and finish the ride. The height and energy have a direct relationship because the more height the ride had, the more total energy there was. We also learned that without air resistance or friction, the mass would not affect and how fast the ride went, therefore making their relationship neutral. We also know that PE and KE have and inverse relationship. As an example, when the car was going down the track, the PE would go down, but the KE would go up. Meanwhile the total energy would stay the same. But once we added friction, things changed and it seemed like energy was getting destroyed because the PE and KE didn't add up to the total energy. But the truth is the energy was actually also converting into heat/thermal energy. Proving the law of conservation of energy true. That energy cannot be created nor destroyed.
