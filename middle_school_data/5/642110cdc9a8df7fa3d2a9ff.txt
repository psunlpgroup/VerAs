Based on the experiments I have done, I have decided upon this data. My initial drop height is 3.5, my first hill height is 2.5, my second hill height is 2.0, my final loop is 2.5, and the mass of my car is 50kg. the kinetic energy of the object will be higher if the object is placed at a greater height. Potential energy isn't transferrable and it depends on the height or distance and mass of the object.  Potential energy and kinetic energy can interconvert and the sum of both quantities is equal to the total energy in a system. Potential energy is stored energy and kinetic energy is due to movement. Potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object starts movingThe law of conservation of energy states that when one form of energy is transformed to another, no energy is destroyed in the process. According to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. So the total amount of energy is the same before and after any transformation. I chose my initial drop height to be 3.5 because it provides enough energy for the whole ride. height and velocity have a direct relationship because if the initial drop height is greater, it provides more energy for the ride. I chose for my second hill height to be 2.5 because it's shorter than the initial drop which means it will give enough energy for the cart to still move throughout the rest of the ride smoothly. Since the gravitational potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its height above the zero position. this supports why I chose for my third hill to be 2.0, I chose this because for the cart to have enough KE to make it over the hill, the hill needed to be shorter than the previous hill and the initial drop. my final loop height was 2.25. I made this loop smaller than the initial drop and 2nd hill because then the cart would have enough KE to make it past the loop and to the end of the ride.
