Here is my recommendation for the new roller coaster. The coaster should start with a 3.5 M drop, We start with this drop height because the speed of the coaster car doesn't go over the safety limit, In my data Drop Height & Speed I did three trials. In the 1st (drop height of 2m) & the speed got close to the speed requirement with a speed of 6.3m/s. The 3rd trial (drop height of 5m) the speed was 9.9m/s which was too fast , But in the 2nd trial (drop height of 3.5) the speed was 8.3m/s which was just under the speed limit, this is how we setteled on a 3.5M drop height. As for mass, we found out through our Mass & speed trials that the mass of the car didn't matter. In all three trials of differing weight 40KG, 50KG, and 60KG respectivly all had the same max speed of 8.3m/s. After the initial drop there will be a hill and a loopty loop both with a height of 3m. The heights of the loopty loop and the hill are both intentionally slightly lower than the drop height, or else the car will not make it through the ride. We know this is the case because of our "Add a Hill data", In trial 3 when the hill height was equal to the drop height  the car did not go up the hill, thus the reason for the slightly shorter hill. The ride will go half way up a ramp then falls back down and does the ride all over again ending where it started with a breaking mechanism.
