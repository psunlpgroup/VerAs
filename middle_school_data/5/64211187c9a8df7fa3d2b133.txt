Dear Gonzales family, 
      If you're in the market for a coaster that is fun, fast, and safe, look no further. I have designed a roller coaster that can meet speeds up to 8.3 m/s, and is safe for all.
     I decided to have the initial drop of your coaster be 3.5 m. I chose this because higher height equals more potential energy (PE) and more PE is more kinetic energy (KE). Then for hill height, it is going to be 2, 2 which will be safe and leave enough energy so the car can finish the ride. The mass of the car does not matter for speed, because mass is not a part of that equation, so it will be left at 50. Mass does affect energy, and when our car has been 50 kg it always makes it to the end. 
     Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but t can change forms. That is what will be happening to the aforementioned PE, turning into KE.
     We hope you consider our coaster plan, thank you!
