Dear Gonzales family 

Our engineering company has designed a safe and exciting roller coaster for your family. We found a safe drop height which would be 3m.  This is a good drop height because the higher the drop height the higher the Total Energy (TE).  For example, when we put the hill height at 3m the TE was 1435J. When I decreased my drop height to 2.50m, the TE also decreased to 1221J.  We found a safe hill height for your roller coaster which would be 2.50m. When we were doing the hill height, it was a little smaller because we didn't want to get stuck after the loop. Also, the initial drop height needs to be higher than the hill height because friction would cause it to lose energy. The initial drop would cause it to lose PE and KE. For example, it did not go over when I put the drop to 2.50m and the hill to 3m.  When I decreased the hill height to 2m it went over. We found a safe car mass which would be 50 kg. The reason we think this will be a good car mass for your roller coaster is that when we put it at 60 kg.  Mass is apart of PE.  When mass increases, PE increases. PE energy is needed to convert to KE so that the car can make it all the way through the track.  When I increase the mass the speed did not change. In trial 1 when we put the mass to 40 kg the speed was at 8.27m/s. In trail 2 we put the mass to  45 kg and the speed was at 8.27m/s. In trail 3 we put the mass to 50 kg and the speed was at 8.27m/s.  When I increase the idea though the bottom of the roller coaster will increase as well. In trial one when we put the ID to two the the speed at the bottom of 6.19m/s . In trial 2 when I put the ID to 22.7 kg  The speed at the bottom of the hill was 7.10m/s. when we put the iD to  3.5 kg the speed at the bottom of the hill was 8.27 m/s.
