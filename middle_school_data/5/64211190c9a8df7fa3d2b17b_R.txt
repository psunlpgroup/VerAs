Hello Gonzales family I am sending this to let you know why you will want to buy my roller coaster. For my initial drop height I chose 4. I chose 4 as my initial drop height because the higher the drop the more speed you will have, and you want a good amount of speed but you also need it to be safe. The height I chose gives my roller coaster more potential energy which later transfers into kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill. I also chose to add a hill to make it more fun. The hill height I chose was 3.5 to make the coaster safe but fun. When I tested all the hill height's I realized that if you do a hill higher than your initial drop it will not go over, so I found out that 3.5 was the best hill height. I then added a loop to my roller coaster to make it even more fun. I used the initial loop because it was the safest that was also really fun and kept the moving. Height affects the total energy because of the amount of potential and kinetic energy used.The mass for my roller coaster is 50 kilograms. When I tested all of my masses they all ended up with the same speed so it didn't matter which mass I chose because mass does not affect speed. The more mass an object has the more potential energy because mass is used in the equation to find potential energy. Mass is also used in kinetic energy because the mass is in the equation for kinetic energy. At the top of the roller coaster there is more potential energy and 0 kinetic but as the coaster goes down there is 0 potential energy and more kinetic energy. The total energy is the same as the initial potential energy is. The Law of Conservation of Energy proves that no energy in the ride can be created or destroyed. It can only transfer to different forms including heat and sound. Thank you for your time and please consider my roller coaster.
