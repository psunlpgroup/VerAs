Dear Gonzales family, 
My roller coaster drop will be at 4.5m, The loop will be 4.3m another drop will go to 4.2 (the top of it)  then it will go to a hill that's 3.9. That's where the ride ends the mass will be at 40 the whole time.  
  I chose everything based on how fast the coaster ended up being at the bottom of the hill. So it was safe for all riders and didn't go past the max speed.
   The Height impacted the PE, KE, Total energy,  And speed because if I didn't start from higher then everything would be different. But the mass really had nothing to do will the track, speed, KE, PE, and Total energy. 
The relation between  PE, KE , and total energy affects the ride a lot because without it the ride would not move.  Because energy needs to flow thew them.
  The Law of Conservation made it so the loop nor anything on the ride isn't taller/ bigger than the start drop Height.
