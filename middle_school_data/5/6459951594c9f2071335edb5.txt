Dear Gonzales family I will be telling you about my research on roller coasters. My roller coaster is and will be the best. and will be the most popular.

 Because it will start from up high at 5.00 meters.  From there you can get the most PE and it the weight will be 60kg. Because then the PE at the top of the first drop will have  2938J of PE and as it will go down that PE will get transferred to KE But the amount of total energy will always stay the same. Because by the law of conservation of energy. energy can not be created or destroyed.

The KE at the bottom of the first drop will be The same as the PE at the top of the first drop. The PE as the coaster car goes down the the drop the PE will diminish so than the KE will climb back up. As it goes back up the hill the PE increases and the KE diminishes. Also the drop height of the first drop will have to be higher than the following hill other wise it will not make it back up the following hill. 

My roller coaster design was vary good it had a initial drop of 3.24 meters and had a hill height of 3.5 meters. The max speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 8.0 meters per second  but through out the ride it stayed around 7.8 meters per second. At the top of the hill it was going around 2.00 meters per second. The mass of the coaster car was 45 kg. The amount of TE was 1434 J of energy and had PE of 1433 J of energy. It also had a mass acceleration of  28.8 m/s.


In the end this is a lot of the info you will need to make the best roller coaster you can make. You just need to remember what ever energy you have at the start is the only energy you will have through out the course of the ride so. Make sure that the initial drop is higher than the following hill.  Also  The roller coaster that I design for you has all these quality's  to make it the best.
