Gonzales Family, 
 To begin, you should start your roller coaster off with a 3.55 m initial drop height. This height will get you to almost top speed, but not to a dangerous point. Based on my trials, a 3.55 m drop will have a top speed of 8.35 m/s. Any higher than this will create a dangerous coaster. Adding on to this, I recommend a hill height of around 3.15 m. You have to keep the hill height under 3.55 m otherwise the coaster car won't have enough energy to make it over.
Next, the higher your coaster's initial drop is, the energy and speed your coaster will have. Based on my data, if you have a drop height of 3.5 m you will have a maximum speed of about 8.27 m/s. But if you raise this drop height up to 4.5, your maximum speed is 9.38 which is too fast and too dangerous. This happens because the higher the car starts, the more potential energy. This can be transferred to kinetic energy and allows the cart to go faster. 
In addition, the mass of your cart really does not make an impact on the speed. Based on my evidence, if your car mass is 40 kg your speed at the bottom of the drop will be 8.27 m/s. If you increase that mass to 60 kg, the car has a speed of 8.24 m/s at the bottom of the drop. Though this does not affect speed, it does have an effect on the amount of energy. For example, when the car mass is 40 kg, there is 1958 Joules of total energy. But if that is increased to 60 kg there is 2937 Joules of total energy.
Adding on further, the higher the amount of potential energy you have at the start, the more successful and fun your coaster will be. You have to have a large amount because a portion of your energy will be transferred to thermal energy. This is called The Law of Conservation of Energy, which states energy can change forms but it cannot be created nor destroyed. The energy isn't disappearing, it is going into other types of energy such as sound and thermal.
In conclusion, you want to have the highest heights while still being safe and logical.
