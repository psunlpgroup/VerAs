hey gonzales family i heard you wanna have a fun roller coster but there needs to be a few limits.
you should have the inital drop 3.5 meters high and the hill should be 3 meters and the loop 2.75 meters.
the mass of the car does not matter but it neds to be inbwetten 40 and 60kg. law of conservtion will be used when the energy going down hill is used to go up the next hill. i disided 3.5 meters hight because if its any higher it wont met the speed you guys want it to be. the higher the drop the more potential energy you have. how much energy you start witth you should end with the same amount
