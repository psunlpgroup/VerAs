Hello, Gonzales family! My team and I have been working hard to ensure you get a fun, yet safe roller coaster for your theme park. Here's our thoughts: The drop height we came up with is 3.6 m. That way it's not too fast that it could hurt anyone, it can make it to the hill AND to the loops with energy to get to the end and the riders still get a fun drop. We tested 5 m as the drop height but, that'd be much too fast and unsafe for the riders so we settled with something less.. 3.6 m. We also looked at the amount of PE and KE at the top, and the bottom of the hill and the drop. Starting at the top the KE was 0 because the car hadn't moved yet and the PE was 2473. as the car accelerated the PE and KE did something called energy transfer, which basically means the PE turns into KE (0) and the KE sucks in the PE (2473). Relating to PE and KE, we talked about our total energy. Total energy is the PE and KE added together. If our PE is still 2473, and our KE is 0, our total energy was 2473 joules and in our experiments we saw a repeating pattern of the same total energy as our PE at the top of the drop. For our hill height decision we said that 3.4 would be good. We wanted the hill to obviously still have height so we lowered it just a little bit less than the initial drop height. by doing that, the initial drop would still be higher than the hill height so it could make it to the end safely. Now, let's talk about car mass. We decided 51 kg would work well. Since mass does NOT affect speed, no matter what the drop height is, the speed at the end of the ride stayed consistent, along with the speed at the bottom of the drop. Law Conservation of Energy states: Energy cannot be created nor destroyed and I think our model correctly shows that by demonstrating mass doesn't affect the speed of the car. We are so excited to see what you think of our coaster!
