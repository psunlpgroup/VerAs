Hello Gonzales family, for are coster design we will have an initial drop height of 3 meters followed by a loop of 2.5 meters and a hill of 2 meters. 

We picked the drop height of 3 meters because having a higher drop will cause the speed to be too much. For example, having a drop height of 5 meters the speed will be 9.82 which is way too much speed. When we lowered the drop to 4 meters the speed will still be 8.84 which is still too much speed for the coster. Having different masses does not matter about the speed after the initial drop. The speed at the end of the initial drop will always be the same no matter what mass you have for the cart. But having different heights for the initial drop changes the speed of the cart after the initial drop. Height will cause a higher PE at the top of the hill and as the cart goes down the drop it will be transported into KE. With a higher PE and KE there will be a higher total energy which will cause more speed going down to make it to the end. 

We have a loop height of 2.5 because energy can't be created or destroyed according to the Law of Conservation of Energy. So with a loop height more minor than the drop, it will make it around the loop. Same with the hill, energy can't be created or destroyed so with a hill height of 2 meters there will be energy to make it over the hill. 

At the top of a 3-meter hill with a 60 kg cart, the PE will be at 1759 joules. As the cart goes down the initial drop the PE will transform into KE, and the KE will be at 1759 joules At the bottom of the initial drop. The total energy will remain the same throughout the whole ride, it will be at 1759 joules.
