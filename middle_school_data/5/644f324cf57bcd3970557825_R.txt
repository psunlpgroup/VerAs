My response to the Gonzales family will be with me using the data shown. For the ID we are going to put it at 3.50 so it's not too high and not too low. The way I know how PE is related to the top of the ID is the car's position and that is where the stored energy is. After the car gets to the bottom the PE will decrease into KE as its energy converts. The way how PE and KE affect my coaster is that PE is the way that the car can move. The KE is how fast it goes and with the PE and the KE, it makes the TE. To the law of conservation, energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can convert from one type of energy to another. The coaster will have enough PE to make it to the end of the ride, and the PE at the top of the ID is 1711 and the KE at the bottom of the ID is 1711. Something I found is that the hill height must be lower than the ID height otherwise the car will not have enough speed to make it over the hill. Now for the car mass, it does not matter in the speed part of the coaster. For the speed, the height will have a role the higher the ID the more speed you will have. The reason I will not go higher is because if I go higher the speed will go over the speed limit of the coaster and the reason I won't go lower is because then the ride will be boring.  My design has a PE of 1711 at the ID but the KE is the same that is because as the PE decreases it turns into KE. This means the speed has to matter as well the speed also plays a role in making the car stay fun but also be safe while going from start to finish. Although my answers change it needs to have one answer for the Gonzales family and that is will they like it? So what I did was made it have a cool look and an extra speed at max but hoping my ride is safe
