The roller coaster's initial drop height should be 3.5 meters tall. I chose this height because this gives the most speed while still being safe. The relationship between height and speed is a direct relationship which says that when height increases the speed of the ride increases. I also chose this height because it gives the most PE while still being safe. The relationship between PE and height is direct saying, when the height increases the PE increases. For the hill, I chose the height to be 3 meters. I chose this height because it gives another big gain in speed while being safe and it will make sure that the car will stay on the track. The relationship between height and KE is shown here being a direct relationship. This means that as height increases the KE throughout the coaster increases. For the weight of the car, I chose 60 kg. I chose this because you can fit more people in a car that can weigh more. The relationship between mass and PE is that as the mass goes up the PE stays the same. Also, the relationship between mass and KE is that as the mass goes up the PE stays the same. Throughout the ride, the relationship between PE and KE is direct meaning that as the PE increases the KE increases. All of these heights and weights have been decided using the law of conservation of energy stating energy can not be created or destroyed. This affected my decisions because it tells me that the TE can be increased or decreased so I know that when the PE gets increased and the TE stays the same that means that the energy is transformed from the KE.
