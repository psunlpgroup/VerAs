Dear Gonzales family, my team and I have tested many designs to see what would be best for your roller coaster. The drop height of my design is 3.5 meters. This is because having an ID height of 3.5 will make the top speed 8.27 m/s. The speed of 8.27 m/s isn't too dangerous or too slow/boring. Having a higher drop height will increase the energy. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3.5 meters 1711 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 4.25 meters, the PE increased to 2077 Joules, and the speed increased to 9.11 m/s. Then, when I increased the drop height even more to 5 meters, the PE was 2444 and the speed increased even more to 9.88 m/s which is unsafe and above our safty requirement of 8.4 m/s. From this data, you can see why we should not go higher or lower than 3.5 meters for a drop height because it could make the ride unsafe or too slow and boring. 

When we tested the ID height of 3.5 meters the PE at the beginning of the ride was 1711 Joules and the KE at the end of the ride was also 1711 Joules then the total energy throughout the whole ride was also 1711 Joules. The higher the PE at the beginning and KE and the end and TE throughout the ride, the more speed is, and the higher the drop height the more energy. I know this because when the drop height was 3.00m the KE, PE, and TE were all 1466 J. Then, when I upped the drop height to 4.00m the KE, PE, and TE were all 1955J. After, when I made the drop height to 5.00m the PE, KE, and TE were all 2444J. 

The PE gets lower as the car goes down the hill and the KEY gets higher. I know this because in trail #1, the PE at the top of the drop was 1369J and the KE at the top of the hill was 0J. Then at the bottom of the drop, the KE was 1369J and the PE at the bottom of the hill was 0J. Then, in trial #2 the PE at the top of the hill was 1711J and the KE at the top of the hill was 0J. Then, at the bottom of the hill KE was 1711J and PE was 0J. In the last trail, the PE 2053J and the KE were 0J at the top of the hill. Then, the KE at the bottom of the hill was 2053J and the PE was 0J.

The Law of conservation energy states that “Energy is neither created nor destroyed.” This is because total energy stays the same throughout the ride. KE goes higher and lower throughout the ride and PE goes higher and lower throughout the ride. No new energy is created and nothing is destroyed I know this because the PE goes up as in is on top of a hill but gets smaller as it goes downhill. Because, in trail #1, we set the ID height to 2m and the PE at the top of the ID was 977 but at the bottom of the drop was 0, opposite for KE. Then, In trail #2 we set the Id height to 3.50m, and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 1710, and on top of the drop was 0, opposite for PE. In our last trail (#3) we set the hill height to 5.00m and the PE on top of the ID was 2442 and the PE at the bottom of the drop was 0, opposite for KE. 

ID and hill height have a lot of importance and you have to make them the right height or else the track won't work right. The hill height cannot be larger than the ID height because in trail #1 when we tested the ID height of 3.50m and kept it there for the entire trail, we made the hill height to 2m and the car made it up the hill. Then, in trail #2 we kept the same ID height but change the hill height to 3.50m and it made it up the hill with little struggle. IN trail #3 we again kept the ID height but made the hill height 5m the car did not make it up the hill, this proves that the hill height cannot be smaller than the ID height. But, if we were to go too low with the hill height the ride might be boring or too slow, and less PE on top of the hill (Talked about in our other data).
