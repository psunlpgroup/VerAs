My group picked a starting height of 3.61 and a hill height of 2.5 this is so we can have a fast but safe roller coaster we made the mass of the cart 50 because after many simulations we found out that mass does not effect the speed when there is no friction. By having more height you will have more PE, KE, TE and speed this is because well at the top you have more PE and the more PE the same KE you have as you go down the drop. The more KE you have the more speed you are going to have because KE is the energy that is used for speed when going down the drop. TE is effected by how high your drop is this is because the more height the more PE and KE and TE is based on how much KE and PE you have. When at the top of the drop you have more PE then you do KE but when going down that drop the PE turns into KE. When the cart gets to the end that energy is then put into TE and TE is based on the amount of PE and KE you had. The law of conservation of energy affects are design by showing that PE on the way down the drop converts into KE and that energy is never destroyed. For example well going down the drop height of 5 meters the speed was 9.87 when at the top of the hill it was 3.44 but at the end it was 9.87. PE is based on height the higher you are the more PE you will have. TE is based on KE and PE at the end of the ride. Mass has nothing to do with energy as long as there is no friction because there is always the same amount of gravity acting on the object no matter how much mass it has.
