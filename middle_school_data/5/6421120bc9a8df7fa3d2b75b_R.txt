For the roller coaster you will want the initial drop, the loop, and then a hill. This is because the initial drop will provide enough kinetic energy to be able to make it around the loop and then to the finish. The perfect height for an initial drop is 3.63 meters. The reason for this is because the speed will get the the max speed and 8.4 m/s. during the experiment we found that the mass of the car dose not effect the speed as even when in friction. this is because the earths gravitational pull is 9.8  and there for everything will be pulled down at the same speed. As well as this the total energy will stay the same. throughout energy transformation the potential energy at the beginning will be converted into kinetic energy as it goes down the hill. 
the higher that drop is the more speed you will have. This is because the cart has built up energy that is in the form of potential energy. when that cart moves down the track the carts potential energy will then be converted into kinetic energy. The mass of the car is but into effect once the cart is placed on the track. this is a result of  the cars total energy being increased because of the mass.
