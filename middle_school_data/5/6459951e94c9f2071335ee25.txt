Dear Gonzales Family,

You should consider my roller coaster design because:  Roller Coaster Essay #1
During. my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my findings about the following:
Gives. you more energy how pe ke and total energy works more mass more the drop needs to be higher. than.hill  

The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters meters.
This is important because a 5-meter drop gives us the highest PE.

For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.5 meters, the PE was 1222 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased at 2443 J.

Potential energy plus kinetic energy equals total energy. 
My data supports this equation because, in the hill simulation, my coaster had 2444 J of PE at the top of the initial drop. It had 2444 J of KE at the bottom of the initial drop. It had 2444 J of total energy at the end of the ride.  the number of total energy that you start with is the energy you will end with.

With the initial drop height should be 360m. The higher the initial drop height, the more energy there will be. This initial drop height is also important to keep the ride safe. A drop height of 360m will give you a speed of 8.38 m/s.
Any hills and loops that follow need to be lower than the initial drop height because  it will not work it  if it is higer because it will be messed up. 

For this reason, the hill height should be 2.50 m.

Car mass will impact the ride but not but not the speed. I know this because when the mass was 50 kg, the energy was 8.38m/s and the speed was 8.38 m/s. However, when the mass was 52 kg, the energy was 8.38m/s and the speed was 8.3 .m/s.
