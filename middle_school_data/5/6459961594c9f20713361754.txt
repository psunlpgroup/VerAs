in this essay I will tell you about the roller coaster my team and I made for the Gonzales family. I will also tell you about the obstacles in the roller coaster.
to start off there is a 5m tall initial drop that is very steep for getting speed as quick as possible then followed by a medium sized hill for fun and to keep speed. then ending is a larger sized loop for fun then the roller coaster ends.
