Greetings Gonzales family as you know I have made a design for your roller coaster. I think the initial drop height should be 3.61 m and then have a hill that is 2.5 m tall.  And the car  mass should be  60 kg.  In this essay I will explain why I made my design like this.
You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster but you also wanted it to be safe so I made the drop height 3.61.  Because that was the highest it could go without going too fast.  Because the higher the initial drop height the faster it is.  For example when the drop height was 5 m the top speed was 9.89 m/s which is too fast.  But then when the drop height is 3.61 m the top speed was 8.40 m/s which is the fastest you wanted it to go.  Another thing the initial drop height changes is the amount of energy, the higher the drop height the more energy.  For example when the drop height was 5 m the PE at the top was 2443 J and KE was 0 J.  At the bottom the PE was 1 J and the KE was 2442 J and the total energy was 2443 J.  But when the drop height was 2.5 m the PE at the top was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.  At the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1221 J and the total energy was 1222 J. 
Then there will be a hill of 2.5 m.  The reason I have the hill as 2.5 m is because a hill has to be shorter than initial drop height because otherwise there won't be enough energy to go over the hill.  For example when I did an Initial Drop height of 5 m and had a hill height of 5 m it didn't go over the hill because it did not have enough energy.  Because at the initial drop the PE was 2450 J and the KE was 0 J.  But then at the top of the hill or close to the top of the hill the PE was 2449 J and the KE was 1 J.  And because of this it wasn't able to go over the hill because it didn't have enough energy.  But when the hill height was 4 it was able to go over.  Because at the initial drop the PE was 2448 J and the KE was 0 J.  Then at the top of the hill the PE was 1959 J and the KE was 489 J and had enough energy to go up and over the hill.  
The amount of total energy depends on how much PE and KE there is.  Because PE and KE added together equals the total amount of energy.  And the initial drop affects the amount of PE because the higher the drop height the larger amount of PE there is.  And the more PE there is at the top the more KE there is at the bottom of the drop.  This is  because all the PE from the top transfers to KE.  This happens because the Law of Conservation of Energy which means that energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be transferred.  So since the total amount of energy is the PE and KE combined the total energy never changes because the energy is only transferred.  For example when I had a drop height of 2.5 m the PE at the top of the drop was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.  At the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1221 J and the total energy was 1222 J.  When I had a drop height of 5 m the PE at the top was 2443 J and the KE was 0 J.  Then at the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1442 J and the total energy was 1443 J.  
The car should be 60 kg.  Because the larger the mass the more energy.  For example when the car mass was 40 kg the total energy was 1985 J.  But when the car mass was 2937.  And the mass doesn't change the speed much.  For example when the car mass was 60 kg the top speed was 8.40 m/s and when the car mass was 40 kg the top speed was 8.40 m/s.
All of this is why you should choose my design for an initial drop height of 3.61 m, a hill height of 2.5 m, and a mass of 60 kg.  Thank you for your time.
