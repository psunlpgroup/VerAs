The height of the initial drop effects the speed because the energy that is in moving the car not the mass the mass dose not effect the speed it is just how heavy it is. The car has to have enough energy to make it up the hill. That is determined by the height of the initial drop. Also the car needs to have enough speed to make it over the hill and into the loop. If the car dose not have enough speed it will roll back and get stuck and someone is going to have to gt them out. The height of the drop impacts the amount of energy the car has in the trials we changed the drop height and that changed amount of energy it had it also changed the speed in the trials.
