Hi Gonzales family. For my coaster, I chose an initial drop height of 3.75 meters because it gives enough energy to get through the ride. I also chose a hill height of 2 meters to make the ride fun. The loop height was also 2 meters to slow the ride down and lastly, the bank height was 0.5 meters to give the ride some depth. The more height the more energy you have and the more energy the more speed. With my initial drop height at 5 meters, the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s. The less height the less speed. When I did an experiment with mass the results surprised me. No matter what mass I had on the frictionless track the speed stayed the same. When I had 40 and 50kg I had 9.88m/s. When you are standing still at the top of a hill you have PE. When you are going down that hill you have KE. The energy will transfer when you move down the hill. The law of conservation states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. On a frictionless coaster, the energy will transfer between PE and KE. When on a coaster with friction energy will transfer through PE, KE, sound, and thermal energy. When you combine PE and KE on a frictionless coaster you have your TE or total energy. When you are on a friction coaster you have to combine all of the energy and that would equal your TE. Thanks for listening to my findings on roller coasters!
