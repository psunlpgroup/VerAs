To make a safe roller coaster for the Gonzales family they need to know the how to properly use energy. I have been studying PE and KE and how they change throughout the roller coaster. First I chose the height of the initial drop to be 5 meters. I chose 5 meters because that is the tallest I could make the initial drop. 
The taller the initial drop the more amount of energy you get to use throughout the roller coaster and it makes it more enjoyable for your guests. Data: 5m --> 2443(J), 2m--> 977(J). 
For the height of the hill I chose the height 3.5 meters. I needed the hill height to be less than the initial drop otherwise the car won't make it over the hill losing all of it's kinetic and potential energy. That would create balanced forces. If the hill is too high then the car won't make it over the hill but if it's too low then it won't have as much energy. Data: 5m --> 984(J), 3.50m --> 2447(J), 2m --> 2150(J). 
The loop at the end of the roller coaster is 2.50 meters, from the ground to the top of the loop. 2.50 meters is a good height for a loop because it isn't too tall but it also isn't too small to where it wouldn't be as enjoyable/ thrilling. Increasing the loop height wouldn't ensure that the car would make it to the end. Energy can't be created or destroyed so using the designs that have the most amount of energy help with friction and making sure that the car makes it through the entire coaster.  Data: 3.50m --> 2.27 m/s, 2.50m --> 4.99 m/s. 
The car mass should be 60kg because it has more energy than a car with a mass of 40kg. Data: 60kg --> 2497(J), 40kg --> 1665(J).That is because the more mass something has the more kinetic energy something has. The mass and KE have a direct relationship so if the mass increases then so does the KE, meaning if the car is heavier then there will be more total energy, PE, and KE.
