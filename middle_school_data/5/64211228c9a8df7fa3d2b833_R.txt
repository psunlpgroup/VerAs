My decision for my height is 3.5 because 3.5 for speed is about 8.2m/s so that speed is high enough where people can still have fun and that speed is not too low where the ride is not fun. This is because the higher an object is the more PE the object will have. For my weight, I am going to have 55 kilograms because weight does not matter in relation to speed.

Height affects pe, ke, and Te because height is in both equations, so the higher the height, the more PE and KE. TE is the amount of energy in the ride at one time so if the car is going down the hill the car will have 10 PE and 200 KE so the TE will be 300 or all the energy added together. Height affects speed because the more height the more time an object has to build up speed.
Mass affects PE, KE, and TE because mass is in both equations for PE and KE so the more mass an object has the more energy they have, and TE is the amount of energy in the whole ride. Mass does not affect speed because in the equations speed does not rely on mass to get bigger.

 The relationship is for whatever is in PE is going to be in KE unless there is friction then some of the PE will go to thermal and there will be less KE. For the TE is the total energy for both of the energy added together at the end. The hill height has to be smaller than the initial drop and the difference can not be the same.

The law of conservation of energy affects my design because if you have too much energy you can't take that way you have to change other variables to get a different outcome of the energy.
