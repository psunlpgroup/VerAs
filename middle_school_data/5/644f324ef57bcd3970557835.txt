Dear Gonzales family, 

Mass and ID

We changed our minds and are moving the drop height down to 4. If we do that the speed will be 8.84. The speed at the top of the hill will be 4.40, and the speed at the end will be 8.84. The hill height will be 2.5.

Mass and speed 

The car mass is 50kg so it isn't too heavy nor too light, And the data above goes with the mass we are putting it at.
