Hi, our team has figured out the best roller  coaster to build for you park. Firstly, the initial drop height should be 3.5 meters. Height and speed have a direct relationship, meaning when one increases, the other increases as well. For example, an initial drop height of 5 meters had a speed of 9.88 m/s. On the other hand, an initial drop height of 3.5 meters had a speed of 8.27 m/s. 3.5 meters is the perfect height because it is tall enough to be fun, but dangerous. A coaster with a speed faster than 8.4 m/s is unsafe, and the height of our initial drop is less than that. The first hill should be 2 meters. Any hill on the ride that goes above the initial drop height will not make it to the end of the ride. This is because the total energy the car has at the beginning is the same throughout the entire ride. In a frictionless environment, PE+KE=TE. The kinetic and potential energy of the ride transfer from one to the other and add up to the total energy. The car would not have enough total energy to make it over a hill taller than the initial drop. Similarly, the loop should be 3 meters for the same reason. The mass of the car should be 50 kg. As mentioned previously, height and speed have a direct relationship. Height and potential/kinetic/total energy also have a direct relationship. Mass and potential/kinetic/total energy have a direct relationship. Mass and speed do not have a relationship, although, because mass does  not affect the speed of the car. Data to support this shows that when the car was 60 kg, the car had a velocity of 8.27 m/s, but when the car was 60 kg, it also was going 8.27 m/s. Knowing the Law of Conservation of Energy and about PE/KE/TE is important because it tells us the limits of our ride. The Law of Conservation of Energy, stating that energy can only be transferred, not created or destroyed, affected the heights and mass I chose for the ride. Please take my thoughts into consideration, thank you.
