The height of the initial drop has to depend on the speed and mass of the car because then the Gonzales family can have a safe and fun ride. If the initial drop height is too much it can be unsafe for the riders. I think the mass of the car should be  3.5 because then it is going fast but not fast enough to make it unsafe.

Height effects total energy because if the height is taller that means the total energy is taller to because if the height is taller the car goes faster and if the car goes faster then the total energy will go up. 
Height also effects PE and KE because if there is more height then there is more Potential energy that means that there is more Kinetic energy to.

Mass also effects PE and KE because if there is more mass then the car will go faster because the heaver things are the faster the tend to go. And if the car goes faster then the PE with rise and if the PE rises, so will the KE.

The relationship between PE and KE is direct because they directly effect each other because they transfer energy. As the car is going down the hill the PE will transfer into KE so there will be some KE and mostly PE. As the car gets closer to the bottom of the hill the more Kinetic energy the car will have.

The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So as the car is going down the track it is creating energy, but when it slows down the energy cannot be destroyed so it has to go somewhere, so it converts into Kinetic energy. It gets stored up and that goes into total energy.
