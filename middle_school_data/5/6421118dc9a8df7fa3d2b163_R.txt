Hello Ganzalas family I wanted to tell you my info on my coaster, and was hoping you guys would hire me.

 
Firstly my height is 3.5, this is because it gives me the most speed without going over 8.4 m/s. The specific speed is 8.26. This means that the riders will have a fun and comfortable time while on our coaster. I chose to use 60kg for my coaster. I did this because it increases the total amount of energy that is used. For example, When I did use 60 kg the PE was 2933 and the KE was 2930. And the TE was 2933. And when I used 55 kg the PE was only 2698 and the KE was about 2697. And the TE was 2698. This proves that mass increases energy.

Hass does not affect speed, so the ride will still be the same speed. I know this because when I used 60 kg The speed was 8.27, and when I used 48kg the speed was still 8.27.

Height affects PE, KE and TE, and speed. I know this because of my data. When I increase the amount of height I have more energy I have. Such as when I made my initial drop of 5m the PE was 2707 at the start and at the bottom it was zero because it transferred into KE. The KE was 0 at the top of the drop but at the bottom, it was 2706. When I used 3.5 the PE was 1874 and the KE was 1873. This shows that height does indeed affect energy because when the height was lower the energy went lower and when it was higher the energy went higher. But does it affect speed? Well... Yes, it does. This is because when my height was 5 my speed was 9.88 but when I used 4m it was 8.84. So if you want an overall higher speed you would need more height. 

The Conservation of Energy is when potential energy transfers into kinetic energy. Total energy never changes throughout a motion. For example, at the start of a hill, there is only total and potential energy. But as the "rock" goes down the hill the potential energy transfers into kinetic energy. The potential energy slowly starts moving down and Kenetic slowly goes up. Energy can never be destroyed or created so it constantly gets transferred.

For all of my info I would love to be on your guys' team. Thank you for your time.
