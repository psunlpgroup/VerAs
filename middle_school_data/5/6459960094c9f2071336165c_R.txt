 Our team designed a roller coaster that begins with an initial drop of 20 meters. This will provide enough potential energy at the beginning to ensure that the roller coaster car has sufficient kinetic energy to make it through all of the hills and curves in the ride without stopping. We have also incorporated at least one additional hill in the ride, which allows for a consistent transfer of potential and kinetic energy.Based on our calculations from the simulation, we have determined that the maximum speed of our roller coaster will be around 60 km/h, which provides a thrilling but safe experience for riders. In designing the roller coaster, we also paid close attention to rider safety. We made sure that the radius of each curve is large enough to prevent excessive lateral G-forces, which can cause discomfort and even injury to riders. Additionally, we designed the roller coaster with proper braking techniques to ensure a smooth and safe stop at the end of the ride. Overall, our roller coaster design provides a thrilling and enjoyable experience for riders while also prioritizing their safety. The initial drop we implemented is based on the idea of potential energy, which stores energy due to an object's position relative to a reference point. By having a significant initial drop, we are able to convert this potential energy into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. This kinetic energy allows the roller coaster car to navigate through the various hills and curves in the ride. Furthermore, we also incorporated the idea of conservation of energy in our design. This means that the total amount of energy in the roller coaster system remains constant throughout the ride. As the roller coaster car moves through the ride, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy and vice versa.
