Dear Gonzales family, 
The engineering company I work for believes that the drop height of my rollercoaster should be 3.50m tall. Because the relationship between height and energy is that the greater the height the greater the amount of energy. For example, when I tested the drop height at 2m the PE was 277j, and then when I increased the size to 4.25m PE was 2079j so as you see the greater the height the greater amount of energy. and to be able to have the most fun but still be safe.

I also think that the hill height should be 2.25 because the relationship between height and speed is that the greater the height the greater amount of speed. For example, when I tested the hill height at 3m the speed was 2.27, and when I increased the hill height to 4m the speed was 8.28 and it did not mack it over the hill. As you can see the higher the hill height the larger amount of speed to have the most fun but still be safe.

I think that the mass of the car should be 50kg but it does not matter what the mass is it does not affect the speed. For example, when the mass of the car was 44kg the speed was 7.66 and when I increased the mass to 54kg the speed was 7.66. so as you can see the mass of the car does not matter the mass does not affect the speed to have the most fun but still be safe.

I also think that the height of the loop should be 2.50m because the if the loop is too small it's too fast and if the loop is too big the cat can not get over the loop. and to have the most fun and still be safe.
