Hi Gonzales family, my coaster goes just under the speed of which would cause injury so it will still be the most fun but also safe, My coaster has a high initial drop, a hill in the middle, and a loop at the end. My cart will make it to the end because there is enough energy to keep it going through both of the obstacles.
