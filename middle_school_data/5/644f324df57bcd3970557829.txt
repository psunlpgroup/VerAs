Dear Gonzales family, 

were going to set the id height for your roller coaster were going to put it at 3.5m. We will put the hill height at 3m because if there is a little amount of friction it will make it over to the end. The total energy at the top of the hill is 1714 and We will put the cart mass at 50kg it’s not too heavy and it’s not too lite so we think that’s the best mass for the cart to be. For example, when me and my group tested the drop height of 3.5 we got pe was 1714 joules. When I increased the drop height to 4.0m the pe increased to 1958. The primary relationship between the two is their ability to transform into each other. In other words, potential energy transforms into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy converts into potential energy, and then back again. It's a never-ending cycle. Instead, the law of conservation of energy says that energy is neither created nor destroyed. When people use energy, it doesn't disappear. Energy changes from one form of energy into another form of energy. The pe at the top of the id was 1714 and the ke at the bottom was 1706   
total energy was 1714. The speed at the bottom of the id was 8.26 m/s and the speed at the top of the hill was 3.23 m/s and the speed at the end of the ride was 8.27m/s. 

Sincerely, Cashton Kutz
