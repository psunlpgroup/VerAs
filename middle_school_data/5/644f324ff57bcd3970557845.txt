Hello Gonzales Family,


The Drop Height of my choice for this typical rollercoaster is 5m because I thought we might want to have the rollercoaster go fast enough to get over the hill. This is because I found out that the higher the hill, the more so the potential energy of the rollercoaster. As potential energy increases, the Kinetic energy will increase too. Whereas newtons law of conservation is For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, The car goes down and hits the bottom then the friction happens. Unresponsive, at the top of the Drop Height, the Potential Energy is 2448J.

 The Hill Height of my choice is 3.5m because of the friction that is caused by drops and acceleration. As the car moves onto the hill, at the top of the hill the Potential Energy is 1719J and the Kinetic Energy is 520J. At the bottom of the rollercoaster, the Potential Energy is 3J and the Kinetic Energy is 2334J.


The friction in this typical rollercoaster is 0.02 so that the cart can make it over as the Car Mass is 50Kg which makes it hard for the cart to get over if it were to be 0.03 friction. I found this by testing different heights and finding the friction that fits the Car Mass and the rollercoaster. The Total Energy is 2448J.
