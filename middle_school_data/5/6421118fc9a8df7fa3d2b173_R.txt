Hi Mr. Gonzales, my team and I have made a roller coaster to be the best. This is the science behind the roller coaster and how it works The drop height we chose of the roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the more height our coaster track has the more energy it has, causing it to go faster.

For example, 5 meters will have more PE than an 3.5 initial drop.For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 2,199 joules. when I increased it the drop height to 5 meters the PE increased at 2,443.  Now that we also tested for speed we found that the higher the drop the more speed it has throughout the coaster. For example, when we changed our initial drop height to 5 meters the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88 m/s and at the top of the hill it was 7.66 m/s. Now when we changed the drop height to 4 meters the speed at the bottom of the drop decreased and was 8.8 m/s and the speed at the top of the hill also decreased to 6.43 m/s. So the more height our track has the more PE, total energy, and speed it will have.

Our total energy has been the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop. For a car with 40kg as its mass it had a PE of 1,959 Joules and A car with 50kg of mass had  a PE of 2,448 Joules. This shows that a car with more mass has a higher KE and PE than one with less. Total energy should always be the same and PE. 

The Law of Conservation of Energy states,  “Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but…it can convert from one type of energy to another”. The relationship between KE and PE is, that a roller coaster will always have more PE than KE. So PE and KE are always transferring back and forth. Also, the drop height has to be higher than the hill height because if the drop height is 4 meters and the hill height is 5 meters the car will get stuck at the top or wont be able to go over the hill. 

And that is the science behind my team's and I's roller coaster. Thank you for your time, Mr Gonzales!
