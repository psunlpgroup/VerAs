Dear Gonzales Family,

This letter is about your new roller coaster endeavor and what you should have for your coaster so it can be safe, fun, and actually run.

You should use a 3.57 Meter initial drop because it gives the most energy while also being safe for humans for example. the 3.57 Meter drop gives 1561 Juels of total energy while a height of 2 Meters only gives 977 Juels of total energy.

You should use a 3.5 meter hill in your coaster because it gives the most energy while still letting the cart get over the hill. With a hill height of 3.5 meters, the cart had 1750 Juels of total energy and went over the hill. But with a hill height of 5, the cart had 2449 Juels of total energy, but the cart did not go over because there is not enough energy in the system to do so. this is because the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be changed to a different type of energy so. without enough energy to get over the hill at the start, there will never be enough energy to get over the hill.

You should use a cart with a mass of 60 kg because it gave me the most energy out of the different masses I tried for example. a cart with a mass of 60 kg had a total energy of 2938 Juels while a cart with a mass of 40 kg only had an energy of 1959 Juels. Also, it does not affect the speed or safety of the ride because unless the mass of the cart changed in the middle of the ride, the velocity stays the same.

Thank you for considering this proposal and I hope your endeavor pays off.

From, Coaster Corp.
