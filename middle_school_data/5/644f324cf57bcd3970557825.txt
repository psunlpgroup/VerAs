My response to the Gonzales family will be with me using the data shown. My roller coaster will start with 
a drop height of 3.5 with a hill height of 3 will prove that it is safe. My speed at the bottom of the drop to be safe is 8.27 that is so it is above 6.47 and under 8.40 those are the safety numbers so it's safe and fun. My design has a PE of 1711 at the ID but the KE is the same that is because as the PE decreases it turns into KE. This means the speed has to matter as well the speed also plays a role in making the car stay fun but also be safe while going from start to finish. There is a change between my results though when I had a mass of 50kg nothing changed which I found interesting. Although my answers change it needs to have one answer for the Gonzales family and that is will they like it? So what I did was made it have a cool look and an extra speed at max but hoping my ride is safe
