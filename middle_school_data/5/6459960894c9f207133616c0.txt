To make a safe and exciting ride for the gonzales family to make sure we do on the roller coaster.
we need pe energy ke energy and mass,friction,heights and energy.

my first part of my roller coaster in my initial drop is 3.50m and we need to get pe into ke to make the speed      8.2 mph that speed is almost the fastest speed we could make it so it will be pretty fun. the hill height was 3.25 so no matter what u can get up the hill and we added friction to make sure u can get up it while having fun and its safe and i also added a loopty loop which is 2.50 so u will go pretty fast in the loopty loop because of all the pe going into ke and the mass of the car is 50kg so it will go pretty fast and it will be safe.the height of the initial drop and the more car mass means the faster and the higher the initial drop. and the car mass impacts the energy and speed by the more mass the faster it will go and more pe the turns into ke is the safer and faster it goes
