My roller coaster design starts with a drop of 3.5 meters and then goes into a 3 meter loop, and a 3 meter hill. This design will be fun and safe because of the rules of forces and motion. When a roller coaster is at the top of a start hill it has all potential energy and no kinetic energy. When it starts moving it has some potential energy and some kinetic energy. When it reaches the bottom of the hill it has all kinetic energy and no potential energy. When a roller coaster starts on a taller start hill it will have more potential energy than if it starts on a shorter start hill. If a roller coaster car is heavy, it will have more energy than if it is light. If there is no friction, the kinetic energy plus the potential energy equals the total energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy is neither created nor destroyed. If a roller coaster's start drop is taller than its hill, the car will make it over, but if the start drop is shorter than the hill, the car will not make it over. My design had a drop height of 3.5 meters and a car that weighed 60 kg. It has 2057 Jules of total energy. Since the drop height is tall and the car is heavy, it has more kinetic and potential energy, so it has more total energy.
