Dear Gonzales family from my research about roller coasters, if you're going to use my design your initial drop height should be 3.5 meters because it is the best speed you could go without hurting people and your hill height should be 3.2. 

A thing you should think about is the relationship between PE and KE because they both equal to total energy. If your PE is 2052 so would your KE and energy can't be created or destroyed.  It can be changed like PE to KE and both add up to total energy.

One thing to think about is the speed because if speed is greater than 8.5 the ride isn't good to go on because people could get hurt so the speed has to be 8.5 or under 8.5 and the mass doesn't matter so you can make the car as heavy as you want.

That all you should know when you are think about which roller coaster you should chose
