Dear Gonzales family,

We have tested multiple heights and drops. and finally found the correct measurements and hill heights for your new roller coaster we also understand that if we increase our heights our P.E. will also increase in case we need to add adjustments. First, we should start with our ID ( Initial Drop ) height. We decided on the size of 3.35m we chose this because we believe that if the Initial Drop is more significant than the Hill Height the car will make it to the end of the coaster we also want to make sure the height is safe and yet still fun. At this point of the ride, the coaster will be at its highest amount of P.E.(1805 Joules) because the more mass or height an object has the more P.E. it obtains. And the K.E. at the bottom of the ID(Inital Drop)would also end up being 1805 Joules where the speed at the end of the ID(Inital Drop) would be 8.09m/s. Then, we chose the Hill Height for this we decided on the height of 2.75m. Because as I said the Hill Height needs to be smaller than the ID height. We did recognize that this height was similar to the ID but we believe it will still work. We know this because when the Hill Height is higher or lower than the ID height the KE is higher than zero.  Also for this, the speed at the top of the hill would be 3.40m/s. Lastly, we chose the car mass of 55kg to ensure that the car will reach the end of the coaster. We know this because the Car Mass was tested multiple times but this was our favorite because with this the car isn’t too heavy or light but just enough mass to stay on the coaster. The law of conservation states that, Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but…it can convert from one type of energy to another.” So when our car reaches the end of the coaster its P.E.(1805 Joules) will convert into K.E.(also 1805 Joules) and then turn into T.E.(which anywhere on the track was still 1805 Joules) at the end where our speed will be 8.09m/s.
