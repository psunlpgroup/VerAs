Hello, Gonzalas Family
The coaster that I think will be the best is a coaster that will have an initial drop height of 3.6 meters, a loop height of 3.15 meters, a hill height of 2.25 meters, and a bank height of 2.64 meters. This is because if I increased my drop height the coaster car would accelerate too fast that it could injure the people riding the coaster. If I increased my hill height the car wouldn't be able to reach the end it would just roll back down the hill so that's why I made the hill shorter than the initial drop. Since, if you increase the drop height, the speed goes up and if you decrease the drop height, the speed goes down. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3.6 meters, the speed of my coaster car was 8.27 m/s. When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the speed increased to 8.84 m/s. When I increase the mass the speed stays the same because mass doesn't affect the speed of the coaster cart, this happens because the gravitational pull is pulling the coaster car at the same speed even if it has more or less mass. At the top of the initial drop, there is more pe because there is more potential for the cart to go faster and ke has 0 at the top. At the end of the coaster, there is more ke because all of the potential energy switched with the kinetic energy so at the end pe has 0 and ke has more because there is now more kinetic energy. Also, pe plus ke equals the total energy of the cart. The higher the initial drop is the more pe you will have at the start and the more ke you will have at the end and mass doesn't affect pe or ke. All of these reasons are why I think my coaster would be the best possible option for you to buy.
