Gonzales family,

I have tested a bunch of different roller coaster designs and I have come up with the best one. Everything I tell you to do is going to be safe and fun for all of the riders.

We will start with the initial drop height. The best drop height I found was 3.50 (m). It was pretty fast while keeping it under 8.4 (m/s), so it is safe to use, and it's pretty tall. Anything more than 3.00 (m) and less than 3.75 (m) so use what you want but I personally would set it at 3.50 (m). The car also has more PE (potential energy) if you start at 3.50 (m). If we start where we are then we will have a lot of speed to make it to the end of the entire track.

Next is the hill height. the best hill height is 3.00 (m) because the car can actually go up the hill. You don't want to make the hill height higher than the initial drop height because then the car wouldn't have enough KE (kinetic energy) to make it up the hill. So the hill height should be less than 3.50 (m).

Next is the mass of the car. The mass of the car doesn't affect the speed whatsoever. I did 4 trials with different masses and the speed was the same. The mass does affect the energy of the car, if you have a greater mass, you will have more PE from the start and more KE toward the end of the track.

Lastly, the relationship between PE, KE, and TE (total energy) affects the ride a lot. Because if you have more PE at the start you will have more KE during the ride and then you will have more TE when you exit or finish the ride. the law of Conservation of energy states energy cannot be created nor destroyed so with that in mind the PE at the start gets transferred into the KE during the ride which gets transferred to TE after the ride

There you go!!!!!! Hope everything works out fine!!!
