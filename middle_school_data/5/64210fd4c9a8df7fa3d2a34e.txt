The initial drop height should be 3.5 meters. This is because having the initial drop at this height will make the speed so that it's fast enough to be fun, and not too fast so that nobody will receave trauma. Now, why does more height mean more speed? Well that's because of PE, and KE. As you gain more height, you will get more PE. PE can transfer to KE which it can use to speed up. PE, and KE are inversely related. This means that as PE goes up, KE goes down. PE, and KE is also related to TE. TE is all of the different energy that is linked to our cart combined. So if PE is 100, and KE is 100, and all the other types of energies is 100, then TE is 300. This is due to the law of conservation of energy. It states that energy can't be destroyed or created. It can transfer to other types of energies, but it will never go away. As for the hill heght, it should be 3. This is because the higher the initial drop, the higher the hill height can be. As for the mass of the car, I will give the choise to the Gonzales family. Mass does effect energy as it is included in the PE, and KE formula. But the thing the Gonzales family should keep in mind is the relationship between mass, and speed. Mass does not effect speed. This is because of the air resistance on earth. Sure it gives more energy to speed up, but that will increase air resistance.
