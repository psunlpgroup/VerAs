The height of the initial drop will be 3.5 meters, the hill will be 3 meters, and the mass of the coaster will be 50 kg. The height of the initial drop is 3.5 meters because that is the height where the coaster is super fast and fun, but still safe. The height of the hill is 3 meters because the hill should be big, but it has to be shorter than the initial drop so the car can make it over the hill. The bigger the drop, the more speed, potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy you will have. If you have more mass, You will have more potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy, but the mass does not affect the speed. All of this affects the ride because you can have a light roller coaster that still goes fast. The Law of Conservation of Mass made me have a hill height that is smaller than the initial drop because you cannot create or destroy energy, so if the hill was bigger than the initial drop then the coaster would not make it over.
