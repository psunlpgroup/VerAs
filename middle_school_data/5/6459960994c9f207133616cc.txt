Dear Gonzales family i have great news i finished my roller coaster design and i think your gonna love it but first i should talk about whats needed.

First the initial drop Height. it should be taller than the hill height because if not the hill will be too tall to get past and that's no fun. The hill heights should be higher than the loop that i am adding because it won't get past that or it will but really slowly. The initial drop height will change the speed because if the initial drop height isn't as fast as we hoped we can adjust the height of the initial drop to make it go faster.

Next i will talk about Mass, the mass of the coaster car should be heavy but not so heavy that the coaster goes too fast so you have to test out which mass will be perfect for my roller coaster. The change in mass will effect the speed by going faster when heavier and slower when lighter making it a serious issue of how heavy the cart has to be to work and not injure people.

Lastly i will talk about Energy, the relationship between KE and PE is that they both equal the total energy no matter what because the energy does not get created or deleted. The energy gets moved onto something else to always equal the same amount of total energy. the law of conservation of energy is quite simply energy can not be created or destroyed so following by that rule the total energy would stay the same through the entire ride.

To conclude I talked about Height, Mass and Energy this will all contribute to making the roller coaster perfect so now i will show you my design for a new roller coaster (see picture below)
