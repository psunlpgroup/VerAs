I choose the height of the initial drop to be 3.25 because it made the coaster stay between 6.7 - 8.4 while it was going down the hills and at the bottom. Height affects PE because you multiply height with gravity and mass to achieve the PE. Height does not affect KE because it is not a part of the equation for KE, 1/2xmxv^2. Mass affects both PE and KE because mass is in both of their equations. At the top of the initial drop, the PE is the same as the total energy. PE transfers energy to KE while going down the hill, but all the while the energy of the two added still equals the total energy, this is in a frictionless world. In a friction world some of the energy may change into thermal energy, but no matter what the sum of all of them together is the total energy. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy will be created or destroyed. Just because the PE shrinks as we go up the hill does not mean it is gone, it may have turned into thermal of kinetic energy.
