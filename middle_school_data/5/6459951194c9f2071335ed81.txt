Dear Gonzales Family,

You should consider my roller coaster design because: my rollercoaster is fast safe and fun.

The initial drop height should be 3.5 m. The higher the initial drop height, the more energy there will be. This initial drop height is also important to keep the ride safe. A drop height of 3.5 m will give you a speed of 8.2m/s.

Any hills and loops that follow need to be lower than the initial drop height.  The drop height needs to be higher than the hill height because the mass will not be enough to make it over the hill  because the mass will be to small.

For this reason, the hill height should be 3.5 m.

Car mass will not impact the speed. I know this because when the mass was 60 kg, the energy was 2446 m/s and. the speed was 9.88 m/s. However, when the mass was 40 kg, the energy was 2446 m/s and the speed was 9.88 m/s.
