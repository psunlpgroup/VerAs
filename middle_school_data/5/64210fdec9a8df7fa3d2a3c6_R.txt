The drop height of the roller coaster should be 4 meters because then the speed at the end of the ride is 8.84 so it wont be to slow or to fast because if the drop height was 3 meters the speed at the end would be 7.76 which is to slow but if the drop height was 5 meters the speed at the end would be 9.88 which is to dangerous. The hill height should be 3 so its high enough for the car to make it to the end but low enough where the car wont go super fast so it isn't dangerous. The cars mass should be 50 because the speed at the end of the ride would be 8.84 so it will make it to the end of the ride. If the mass is to low it wont make it to the end. So when the mass is higher the total energy is higher. So if you use a drop height of 4, a hill height of 3, and a car mass of 50 the ride will be fun and safe. The car will make it to the end without being to slow where its boring and wont be to fast where its dangerous.
