my design will have the initial drop be 3.75 because then we can get the most pe out of it and when you have more pe you have more ke because pe transfers into ke. the mass doesn't really matter it's the same speed. next, I think the hill height should be 3.5 because it cant be higher than 3.75 because it won't make it to the end. I think the loop should be 2.5 because then the coaster can make it through and not get stuck because the law of conservation of energy states that it cant lose energy but the energy can change. the ride is safe while still being exciting because the ride does not Exide 180 mph but is over 160 mph. the car mass doesn't matter as the mass does not affect the speed.
