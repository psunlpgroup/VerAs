Throughout all of our tests and experiments, we have found all of the answers that you have asked us and now we will tell you how to make your rollercoaster. 

1st: When making your rollercoaster the Gonzales family you would want the initial drop height should be 3m. The hill height should be 2.50m. Finally, the mass should be 50kg. 

2nd: why did I choose the height and the mass well let me tell you...  The reason I chose the height of the initial drop is because of the speed so the rollercoaster isn't too low nor is it too fast. My team wanted to keep the hill height at 2.50 since it was low enough that we could get over it. For the mass, we found out it doesn't matter what mass you have the speed will be the same. In our trials for finding this out, we found out that whatever you have for the mass doesn't matter if the initial drop and hill height are the same.

3rd: The way height and mass affect PE KE Total energy and speed is by...  With more mass and height there will be a stronger gravitational pull since you're increasing the distance from the Earth's core. With mass as well the more you have of it the more the PE KE and total energy will increase. 

4th: The relationship between PE KE and total energy is... Whatever the PE is that will be the total energy. The relationship between PE and KE is PE is the top of the rollercoaster and when there is that speed going down the hill it turns into KE. 

5th: The way the law of conservation of energy affects our rollercoaster designs is by what we found out about the conservation of energy. In that law, we learned that energy created can not be destroyed... The only way this would be affected is if the friction is different like not the same friction we have here on earth.so we couldn't mess with anything to do with friction.
