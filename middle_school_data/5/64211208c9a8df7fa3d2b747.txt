To the Gonzales family these are my recommendations on how you should build you park. First lets start with the initial drop, I think the initial drop should be 3.61 meters because my data showed that that drop starts off with enough potential energy to get threw the ride and is the highest you can go with out going over 8.4. Which is the fastest you can go without getting hurt. Then i think the loop should be after the initial drop so you get the most speed going threw the loop. The loop should be 3 meters high so the cart goes threw the loop faster but its still high enough to be fun. Now lets talk about the hill, I think the hill should 2 meters high because my data showed that you have the most speed going over a 2 meter hill so it will be more fun for the people riding the roller coaster. The law of conservation of energy affects this design because at the top of the initial drop the cart starts with 0 PE. Then when the car starts moving that PE is being transferred in KE. Now lets talk about what the mass of the car should be. The mass of the car does not matter our data showed that the mass of the car does not effect speed. This is because the acceleration due to gravity is always 9.8 so the car is always going to drop the same speed no matter mass. Those are my recommendations for your park.
