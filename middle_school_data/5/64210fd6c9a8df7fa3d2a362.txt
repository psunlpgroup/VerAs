the initial drop should be 5 meters because it will have the maximum PE for the car and be the most likely to make it to the end. Also the mass of the car should be 50 kilograms so the car can have enough PE but not enough to go flying off the track. Then the first hill should be 4 meters so the car will have enough PE to make it over the hill. Since the hill has to be lower than the initial drop because the car has to have more Kinetic energy at the top of the hill than the initial drop so the car can make it over. Then loop should be 3 meters tall so once again the car can make it through the loop with more than zero kinetic energy. The reason you need more than zero kinetic energy is so the car never stops moving through the track so it can make it to the end. Also each loop or hill needs to be shorter than the one before because of the law of conservation where energy cannot be created or destroyed. So the next hill can be taller since you would have to create energy to get the car over the hill.
