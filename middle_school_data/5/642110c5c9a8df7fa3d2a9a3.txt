There is a direct relationship between the relationships between initial drop and hill heights to ensure the car has enough energy to make it to the end of the ride. From my data, you need speed to make it up the hill. The more speed, the more energy to make it up the hill That is a direct relationship. A drop height of 5m with a 2m hill gives 7.68 m/s, but only 2.18 m/s with a 2.25m drop, which is barely enough energy. The hill height and speed are direct relationships. The higher the drop, the more KE you have, and since KE has velocity in the equation, KE and velocity are direct relationships. Velocity and Speed are almost the same, just without the direction, so you could say that speed and velocity are also direct relationships. From my data, a drop height of 5m gives 9.87 m/s at the bottom of the drop, but a drop height of 2.25 only gives 6.63 m/s. Mass, on the other hand, has no relationship with speed, because gravity wants to pull the car faster to the ground for more mass it has but requires more force to do so, so it balances out. From my data, a drop height of 3.5m and a 60kg car moves at 8.27 m/s, and the cart moves at 8.27 m/s when the car is 40kg. Energy and mass do have a direct relationship because there is no mention in the equation of the amount of force required, only the force exerted.
