     Dear Gonzales family, 
For your roller coaster, you will need to have an initial drop higher than the rest of your roller coaster that way the potential energy at the start can carry the car to the end. You will also need a big mass to carry you to the end. For the initial drop if the height of it is five meters then you will need to have hills/loops shorter than it otherwise it will not make it to the end. That potential energy will turn into kinetic energy at the bottom. Even though the energy transfers the amount will stay the same throughout the whole ride. An example is if the amount of potential energy was 1,264J at the start and at the end, the kinetic energy would be the same 1,264J this is also known as the law of conservation of matter where matter cannot be created or destroyed. But one of the most important parts is that since energy cannot be created or destroyed the energy at the start will be the same at the end also known as total energy. The height for your initial drop for your rollercoaster is 3.5m tall we decided to make the initial drop 3.5m tall because it is the maximum height we can go for the element of fun without endangering your passengers. The next part a loopty loop is 2.5m tall we choose this so the cart would regain more potential energy. Then you will have 2 hills the smaller one being 2m tall this way you have a smaller hill leading to a bigger hill making it seem like you go up and up and up and the bigger one is 2.5m tall that way right before the end you will have a steep drop. Next is the mass of your car the mass will be 50kg the perfect balance for speed. The height at the beginning is important because you will need it to create a higher Potential energy which will transfer to Kinetic energy. The energy in this ride will only transfer it can't be created or destroyed so if it starts with 50 J of Potential energy it will transfer to 50 J of kinetic energy at the end
