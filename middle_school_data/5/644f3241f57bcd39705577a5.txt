Dear Gonzales family, me and my team just got done with the roller coaster and it is already used. It is fun, safe, and has lots and lots of speed.
                       Here is some data to prove it is safe, fun, and has lots of speed. The drop height of the roller coaster is 3.75 meters. This is because we want it to be fun and also steep so they can make it to the end of the roller coaster. 
      I made it higher then it won't be as safe but if we made it lower they would not make it to the end.
                    For example, when I tested the drop height of 3.75 meters, the PE ( potential energy ) was 0.02 joules. When I increased the drop height to 8.847 meters, the KE ( kinetic energy ) decreased by 6.42 joules for example the PE at the top of the ID is 0.02 and the KE at the bottom of the ID is 8.847 so when I add PE and KE ( PE + KE + TE )  together the TE (total energy)  is 6.42 so that is how I know it's safe.
                      As well as that the car mass is 55 is it light enough to make it to the end of the ride safely this will also make it fast and fun to the end of the ride.
