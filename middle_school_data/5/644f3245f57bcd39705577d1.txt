Dear gonzalez family, 

The drop height of my rollercoaster design is 3.50 meters. This height allows the car to have enough PE that it needs to turn into KE, so it has enough energy to make it to the end. 
Once you increase the height of the drop you increase the PE. For example when I tested trail #1 the drop height of 2 meters, and the PE what 977 joules. When I increased the drop height in trail #2 to 3.50 meters PE increased to 1710 joules. In the last trial #3 the drop height was 5 meters and the PE increased to 2442. From my trials, you can see that whenever you increase height, you increase the amount of energy.
 Another relationship that my company learned was that height also affected speed.  For example, in my first trial, my initial drop height was 3.75 meters and my speed at the bottom of the hill was 8.56 and my speed at the top was 4.92. In my 2 trials, the ID was 4.00  and the speed at the bottom was 8.83 and the speed at the top of the hill was 5.39. And for my third trial, the ID was 5 and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88 and the speed at the top of the hill was 6.97.
