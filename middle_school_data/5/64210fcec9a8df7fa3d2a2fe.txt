I propose that the initial drop height for the roller coaster is 3 meters tall. this will give the car more pe and ke, pe and height has a direct relationship meaning when one goes up the other also increases. When the hill height is 3m the pe at the top of the hill is 1466J but when the height was decreased to 2m the pe was only 977j. at this height, it will be fun but still safe. With a drop height of 5m the speed is 9.88 m/s which is not safe for the riders at a height of 3m the speed was 7.66m/s, this height is safe and fun for all the riders. with the drop height of 2m the speed was under 6.7 m/s which is not fun and does not make it to the end of the ride. the hill height should be 2 m and the loop should be 2.5m, the hill has to be less than the height of the drop to make it over the hill. when the hill height was 5m the car did not make it to the end of the ride but with a hill height of 2m the car could make it over the hill.
the mass of the car is 40 kg, which gives the car 1955J of pe and ke. To find the pe in something you have to take the height, mass, and gravity multiplied together, the more mass there is the more pe the car will have. same with ke half of the mass times the velocity squared. the mass does not affect the car's speed with a mass of 60kg the max speed was 7.66m/s but when the mass is decreased to 40kg the speed stays the same.
 The total energy is the pe and the ke combined. the ke and the pe are always the same in a frictionless scenario, at the top of the hill there will be no ke because the car isn't moving. in the middle of the ride, there will be some ke and some pe as the pe is transferring to the ke. the energy is not destroyed but moved to different forms such as ke and thermal energy.
