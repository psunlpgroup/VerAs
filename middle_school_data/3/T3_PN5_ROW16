Dear, Gonzales Family I think that our roller coaster should have a meter drop. This maximizes the potential energy the car has. To be more specific the car has J of potential energy at the top of the hill. I also think that our car should be kg. When gravity pushes our car down to the bottom of the drop, the stored energy will turn into kinetic energy because of the gravity. At the bottom of our meter drop the car will have J of kinetic energy. The potential energy from the top of the hill will just convert into potential energy. The total energy will also be J. When the car goes down the drop all that potential energy will be turned into kinetic energy. Next, I think the hill should be . meters tall. From experimenting, I've learned that the higher the initial drop height, the more speed, and the less high drop height. The Mass has no effect on speed.
