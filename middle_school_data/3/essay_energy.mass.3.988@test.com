1. The initial drop height should be 5m, because when the initial drop height is at 3, the pe is much lower than the pe at a drop height of 5. 2. As you know when there is more pe the more ke the roller coaster will have when it is in motion. 3. When the cart is at the bottom the pe is lower than the ke, and when the cart is at the top the pe is at 2500 and the ke is 0. 4. But when its at the bottom its at 0.(depending on how high off the ground the tracks are) about 0 and the ke is at 2500. 5. Pe and ke are added together to find the total energy. 6. But that doesn't work when there's friction, so you also need to account other things into the total energy, like heat, sound and friction energy. 7. Keep in mind that the energy doesn't disappear. 8. So energy cannot be created nor destroyed just like mass. 9. instead it transfers into friction and ke and pe and all other things it can transfer into. 10. Changes in pe and ke happens almost always when there is a change in height like when at the initial drop the pe is for example 2500 and the ke is at 0 and then the cart starts to move then the ke goes slightly up and the pe goes down, the energy is transferring when the cart is going down. 11. And when the mass of the cat is higher the faster the cart will move downhill due to inertia. 12. So it will go faster. 13. Also the higher the initial drop height the higher the pe will be and the faster the ride will be which is hopefully what you want. 14. I learned that the higher the initial drop height the more speed it will have at the bottom. 15. This means mass does not affect the speed in a frictionless environment.
