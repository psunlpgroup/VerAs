1. I think the initial drop height should be 3.5 meters this is because when the height of the initial drop was 3.5 meters the speed was 8.27 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop but when the drop height was 4 meters the car had a speed of 8.84 m/s.2. 8.84/s is over the max speed of 8.4 m/s which is the max speed before the passengers are not safe.3. But 8.27 m/s is right under the speed before which the car is not at a safe speed but is also above the fun speed of 6.7 m/s making the ride fun and safe.4. The hill height should not be over 3 meters because when the hill height was 5 meters the same as the initial height drop the car did not make it to the end of the ride but when the hill height was 4 meters and the initial drop was 5 meter the car could make it over the hill.5. This means any hill or loop whose apex is over the initial drop the car will not make it.6. This makes the initial drop and 3.5 and the hill 3 meters perfect because it will have a speed that is not dangerous and the car will make it over the hill.7. But this only happens if there is no Since mass doesn't affect speed we think the mass should be 60 kg because then we can have more passengers.8. when the height of the initial drop was 3 meters the PE was 1466 J and at the bottom, the Ke was 1466, but when the Release height was 4 meters the PE was 1955 J and the Ke at the bottom of the initial drop was 1955.9. The reason the energies are the same is that when at the top of the initial drop the car has no motion so there won't be any Ke, if there is no fiction all that energy will be KE because of the car height but when at the bottom of the initial drop the PE will be 0 because it has no height and because the car has no friction the energy will switch between Pe and Ke, so the energy will transfer from Ke from Pe, there for the car will have the same KE at the bottom as the car has Pe at the top.10. This means the car had more energy the higher the drop and the more speed it will have to get over hills which makes the run more exciting.11. We should also add a hill of no more than 5 meters or else it will stop according to my data.12. When the initial drop was 5 meters and the hill height was 5 meters the cart did not make it to the end.13. This is because The Law of Conservation of Energy says, energy is not created nor destroyed energy only changes forms.14. So the cart will not be able to just make the energy to push itself above the 5 meters.15. When the initial drop height was 4 the PE was 1955 J and the KE was 0 J at the bottom, the KE was 1955 J and the PE was 0.16. The total energy stayed the same in 1955 so there for the cart's energy stayed the same making it impossible to make it up the hill if it was the same height as the initial drop.17. We believe we should also add a loop for more excitement, this will work as long as the apex of the loop is lower in height (meters) this is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy.18. We also believe that The Mass of the car should be 60 kg, this is because the more mass an object has the more energy(J) it has.19. For example, when the mass of the car was 50 kg the PE was 2446 J, but when the car was 60 kg the PE was 2936J.20. So the more Mass the car has the more energy the car will have which is a direct relation.21. Also when The hill height was 4 meters the Pe at the top of the hill was 1955 J and the KE was 0 J but at the bottom of the initial drop the PE was 0 J and The Ke was 1955 J.22. This only happens in a frictionless environment but This means the Pe is the same as the Ke at the bottom.23. When there is more mass there is more Pe and Ke.24. For example, when the mass of the car was 60 KG the Pe was 2936 J but when the mass of the car was 50 Kg the car had a Pe of 2446 J.
