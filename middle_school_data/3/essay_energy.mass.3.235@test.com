1. The first recommendation that I would make, is that they make the initial drop height 5 m. 2. I would make this recommendation, because when the initial drop height is 5 m, the PE at the top of the drop is 2834 J, and the KE at the bottom of the hill is 2833 J. 3. Whereas if the initial drop height were 2 m tall, the PE at the top of the drop, would only be 1134 J, and the KE at the bottom of the drop would only be 1133 J. 4. I think this proves that if you want more energy to keep your cart going to the end of the roller coaster, you want the highest initial drop height, which would be 5 m. 5. Adding on to what I said about the amount of KE and PE, since the track is frictionless, in this simulation, the PE and KE combined will always equal the total energy, so for the initial drop, since there were 2834 J of PE at the top of it when it was 5 m. tall, and 0 J of KE at that height, the total energy would end up being the two of those added together, which equals 2834 J. 6. As the cart heads down the drop, all that PE at the top of the drop will decrease, and the amount of KE will increase. 7. This means that PE and KE, have an inverse relationship, since when one of those values increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. 8. But, since the law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, the PE, does not just disappear, and the KE is not just created. 9. The PE from the top of the drop transfers itself into KE, as it makes its way down the drop. 10. Meaning no energy is created or destroyed, it has just changed forms. 11. However, in a real-life scenario, the track would have friction. 12. This means that some of that PE, that transferred into KE in the frictionless track scenario, would transfer into thermal energy. 13. It might seem like it is losing energy, but the friction of the track is really just causing it to change into a different form, then what you might see in the simulation with the frictionless track. 14. The second recommendation I would make is to make the hill height 3 m. 15. I would make this recommendation because, based on the data that was collected, the hill height has to be smaller than the initial drop height. 16. For example, when we put the hill height at 2 m. and the initial drop height at 5 m. the cart easily made it to the end, and over the hill, and at the top of the hill, the amount of KE was 1743 J. 17. However, when we kept the initial drop height at 5 m. and put the hill height at 5 m. also, the cart did not make it to the end or over the hill, and the KE at the top of the hill was only 1 J. 18. This shows that the hill height should be shorter than the initial drop height, and I think that 3 m. would be a really good height for the hill, since it is shorter than the initial drop height of 5 m. and it has more PE at the top, causing for a more fun ride going down the hill. 19. The final recommendation that I would make is to put the mass of the car at 60 kg. 20. I would recommend this because it causes there to be more energy. 21. When the mass of the car was at 40 kg. 22. The total energy was 1957 J, and that was also the PE at the top of the initial drop, and at the bottom of the drop, the KE was 1954 J. 23. However, after changing the mass to 60 kg. 24. The total energy increased a lot to 2936 J, which was also the PE at the top of the initial drop, and the KE at the bottom of the initial drop was 2911 J. 25. This data shows, that the more mass you have, the more energy the car will have to make it to the end, and still be safe and fun.
