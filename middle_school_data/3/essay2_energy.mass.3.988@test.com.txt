1. The initial drop height should stand at 4 m because when the initial drop height is at 3, the pe is considerably lower than the pe at a drop height of 3 m. but when it is at 5 m it is to fast and everybody would die 4 provides good fun and safe height for riders.2. As you know when there is more pe the more ke the roller coaster will deliver when it is in motion.3. When the cart is at the bottom the pe is lower than the ke, and when the cart is at the top the pe is at 2500 and the ke is 0.4. But when it is at the bottom it is at 0(depending on how high off the ground the tracks are) about 0 and the ke is at 2500.5. but when there is more mass affecting your cart it does absolutely nothing the speed of a cart at 40 and a speed of a cart is the same.6. Pe and ke are added together to find the total energy.7. But that doesn't work when there's friction, so you also must account for additional forces in the total energy, like heat, sound, and friction energy.8. Keep in mind that the energy doesn't disappear.9. So energy cannot be created nor destroyed just like mass.10. instead, it transfers into friction and ke and pe and all additional forces it can transfer into.11. Changes in pe and ke happen almost always when there is a change in height like when at the initial drop the pe is for example 2500 and the ke is at 0 and then the cart starts to move then the ke goes slightly up and the pe goes down, the energy is transferring when the cart is going down.12. And when the mass of the cart is higher the faster the cart will proceed downhill due to inertia.13. So it will go faster.14. Also the higher the initial drop height the higher the pe will be and the faster the ride will be which is hopefully what you want.
