1. My first recommendation is the initial drop height should be 5 meters, we found that height directly relates to the potential energy at the top, kinetic energy at the bottom, and the speed of the car.2. This is proven when you look at the data we collected, for example, a 3-meter drop has an initial pe of 1759J and at the bottom, the kinetic energy was 1758J, and the speed was 7.66 m/s and for a 5 meter drop the potential energy at the top was 2932J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2931J, the speed was 9.89 m/s.3. The reason that you want to maximize your potential energy is that the potential energy you have at the top in a frictionless environment is equal to the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop.4. Another recommendation is the hill being below the height of the initial drop this is because when we had the hill height just below the initial drop height the kinetic energy at the top was 291J which is much less than when we had the hill at 2 meters which had a kinetic energy of 1765J at the top of the hill.5. This is because as you go down the hill you lose pe and gain kinetic energy but when you go up the hill you lose kinetic energy and gain pe this is because potential energy and kinetic energy are inversely related however they are both directly related to height and total energy for example when the height of the drop was 5m the potential energy at the top was 2932J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2930J but when the hill height was 2m the potential energy was 1173J at the top of the drop and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1172J.6. Both kinetic energy and potential energy are related to total energy because when for the 2m drop when the total energy was 1173J the potential energy at the top was 1173J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1172J but for the 5m drop the total energy was 2932 and the kinetic energy at the top was 2932J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2930J.7. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed however it can be transferred from one type to another.8. My last recommendation is that the roller coaster car has a mass of 60kg this is because if you want to maximize your pe and kinetic energy you need more mass because they are directly related.9. For example, a car with a mass of 40 kg has initial potential energy of 1957J and kinetic energy at the bottom of 1938J and for a 60kg car the initial pe is 2933J, and kinetic energy at the bottom is 2906J.10. However mass does not have an effect on the velocity of the car in a frictionless environment.
