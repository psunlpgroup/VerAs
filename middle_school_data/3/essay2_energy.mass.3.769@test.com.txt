1. The initial drop should be 4 meters.2. The higher the drop the more pe at the top of the drop and the more ke at the bottom of the drop.3. So when the drop height is higher then the total energy will go up.4. The pe at the top of the hill is the total energy and the ke at the bottom of the hill.5. So ke and pe have a direct relationship with total energy.6. When the cart is at the top of the drop the energy is all in pe and ke is 0.7. But when you get halfway down the drop the pe and ke are 50 percent each.8. Then when you get to the bottom of the drop ke has all the energy and pe is zero and the ke is what the pe was at the top of the drop.9. The ke changes to pe when the car starts going up the hill and when it gets to the top of the hill it is all pe.10. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed but can change into a different type of energy.11. The initial drop has to be higher than the hill height so the car can make it over the hill.12. So the hill drop should be four meters.13. The higher up the car is the more pe it has.14. The mass does not change the PE and KE it has.15. When the car mass was 60 kg it had 2933 joules of pe and had 2900 joules of ke.16. But when the mass of the car was 40 kg it had 1955 joules of pe and had 1950 joules of ke.17. Pe is the amount of energy at the top of the hill and it is the resting energy.18. Ke is the energy when something is in motion or going down the hill.19. When there is more mass the ke and pe will go up because they are direct relationships.
