Hello Gonzales Family, For your new roller coaster, I chose to have the initial drop height at m tall so that you can still have other exciting parts of the ride that the car is still able to make it over. The height of the drop relates to the PE at the top because when you make the initial drop higher, the less kinetic energy there is so therefore it transforms into more potential energy. The KE at the bottom relates to the drop because at the bottom you can't go any faster so when you reach the bottom all of the potential energy that was used in the drop, was converted to kinetic. The changes in the PE and KE while going down this initial drop is that when going down the drop, the PE started to decrease, while the KE started to increase. For the mass of the car, I chose to make it kg so that it's right in the middle and doesn't go too fast or too slow. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is that when the mass is greater the KE and PE are greater as well. the relationship between mass and KE is a direct relationship and the relationship between mass and PE is also direct. For the hill height, I did . m tall because since in my experiments I found out that having an initial drop height of m and a hill height of m, it didn't make it over the hill so having . I know can make the ride fun and exciting while being practical and making it to make sure it makes it through. The relationship between PE and KE is probably inverse because when the PE decreases, the KE increases and vis versa. Energy transformation is when the energy gets transformed from one form to another like in this case it gets transformed from potential to kinetic. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that energy can not be created nor destroyed.
