1. My team and I decided that we would like our initial drop height to be 5, the highest drop height there was. 2. When designing the roller coaster we had to think about how the drop height would affect the PE and KE. 3. We figured out that the higher the drop height the more PE and KE there would be. 4. At the drop height of 5, the PE at the top of the drop was 2834, whereas the PE at the drop height of 2 was 1134. 5. The drop height and hill height also affect how much KE there will be. 6. If the drop height is 5 and the hill height is 3 the KE at the top of the hill will be 1142. 7. But if you were to have a drop height of 5 and a hill height of 5 the KE at the top of the hill would be 37, not even enough to get the cart over the hill. 8. Staying with the topic of the initial drop, how does the PE transfer into KE going down the drop 9. If you started at the top of a drop with a height of 5, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2834, but as the cart goes down the drop that energy transforms into KE. 10. So in the middle of the drop, the KE and PE would be 50/50, but by the time you get to the bottom of the drop, you would have 2834 joules of KE. 11. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy is lost, it is just transformed into a different kind of energy, this applies to the roller coaster because at the start the roller coaster has PE, but as it goes down it becomes KE. 12. This shows how the energy transforms into other energy. 13. The mass also affects the PE and KE, the more mass the roller coaster has the more PE and KE the coaster will have. 14. If you have a car mass of 40, the KE is 1946 and the PE is 1949. 15. But as the mass gets greater the PE and KE grow to. 16. So if you have a mass of 60, the KE is 2933 and the PE is 2938. 17. The total energy is also changed when you
