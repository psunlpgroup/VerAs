1. The height of the roller coaster should be somewhere between 4-and 5 meters if you want to ensure that the roller coaster will have a higher possibility of making it over the hill and the loop. 2. Because if you don't have enough initial PE the roller coaster won't make it to the end of the ride and at that point, the ride would be pointless. 3. The higher the roller coaster is the more PE it will have and it will have a greater KE at the bottom of the hill, so the height can determine if the energy amount will be small or large. 4. The PE and KE of this simulation switch depending on the height of the cart. 5. Like if the cart is at the highest point of the roller coaster there is going to be a lot of PE and no KE, but as it reaches the bottom of the roller coaster or it comes to a stop then KE will be larger. 6. In the tests we ran as the cart went down the hill the PE went down and the KE went up. 7. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy is not being created or destroyed, as the cart goes down the hill but it is being used up and slowed by friction and that is what causes the cart to come to a stop if there isn't enough force and energy to continue the cart forward. 8. The hill height is going to have to be smaller than the initial drop height otherwise the cart will not make it over the hill because it will not have enough energy to get over the hill considering the PE at the top of the hill would be less and you can't expect smaller energy to be able to top bigger energy, especially depending on the cart's mass it might not even make it halfway up the hill. 9. The mass of the cart will have a larger acceleration if it has a large drop height so the relationship between mass and height matters otherwise the roller coaster might not be operational. 10. As you can see we have been doing some deep digging into finding out what will make a roller coaster fun and operational, and most importantly, safe. 11. So as long as the roller coaster has enough mass compared to height it will be fully operational, safe, and fun for the public. 12. The higher the roller coaster is, the more speed or velocity the roller coaster car will have.
