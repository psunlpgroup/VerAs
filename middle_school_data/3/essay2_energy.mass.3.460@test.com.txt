1. My team and I decided that we would like our initial drop height to be 5, the highest drop height there was.2. When designing the roller coaster we had to think about how the drop height would affect the PE and KE.3. We figured out that the higher the drop height the more PE and KE there would be.4. At the drop height of 5, the PE at the top of the drop was 2834, whereas the PE at the drop height of 2 was 1134.5. The drop height and hill height also affect how much KE there will be.6. If the drop height is 5 and the hill height is 3 the KE at the top of the hill will be 1142.7. But if you were to have a drop height of 5 and a hill height of 5 the KE at the top of the hill would be 37, not even enough to get the cart over the hill.8. Staying with the topic of the initial drop, how does the PE transfer into KE going down the drop? If you started at the top of a drop with a height of 5, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2834, but as the cart goes down the drop that energy transforms into KE.9. So in the middle of the drop, the KE and PE would be 50/50, but by the time you get to the bottom of the drop, you would have 2834 joules of KE.10. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy is lost, it is just transformed into a different kind of energy, this applies to the roller coaster because at the start the roller coaster has PE, but as it goes down it becomes KE.11. This shows how the energy transforms into other energy.12. The mass also affects the PE and KE, the more mass the roller coaster has the more PE and KE the coaster will have.13. If you have a car mass of 40, the KE is 1946 and the PE is 1949.14. But as the mass gets greater the PE and KE grow to.15. So if you have a mass of 60, the KE is 2933 and the PE is 2938.16. The total energy is also changed when you have more KE and PE.17. Because the total energy is KE and PE added up, that means the more PE and KE you have then the more total energy you will end up with.18. Our team decided to change our height to 3.75 because if will use the original drop height of 5 the speed would be too fast.19. If we had a drop height of 5 the total speed would end up being 9.88, and we were not allowed to go past the speed of 8.4.20. We also decided to have our hill height be 3, because then the cart will have enough energy to get over the hill.21. And that is the same for the loop, it will be changed to 2.75.22. We also learned in our trials that mass does not affect energy, but it does affect PE and KE.23. The more mass you have the more PE and KE you will have to because mass is in the equation for PE and KE.24. Therefore it affects both of them.25. That goes for height too, because height is in the equation to find both KE and PE, it also affects both of them.26. When people look at roller coasters they think of speed, but what really affects the speed? Height affects the amount of speed the roller coaster will have.27. If the height of your initial drop is 3, and you get to the bottom of that drop the speed would be 7.66.28. But if you were to drop from a height of 5, the speed would be 9.83 by the end of the drop.29. Another thing that affects speed is the mass, if you were to have a cart with a mass of 40 and you go down the coaster the speed at the end would be 8.84.30. But if you were to go down the drop with a car mass of 60, you would have the exact same speed.31. Therefore the speed does not change if you change your mass.32. The Law of conservation of energy states that no energy is made or lost.33. So in our roller coaster, none of the energy is ever lost, it can just be made into other types of energy like sound or heat energy.34. Does mass really affect KE and PE? Well, it does because mass is in the equation for KE and PE. therefore it affects how much energy both of them have.
