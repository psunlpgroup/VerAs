1. The height of the initial drop should be 5 meters because the potential energy 2443 J is and the other heights are less potential energy. 2. Also, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed so when the potential energy decrease as it goes down the hill the energy will transfer to kinetic energy and will increase the speed of the car so it has a better chance of making it to end. 3. Potential, Kinetic, and Total energy all affect the ride because potential energy which is stored energy will be the starting amount of energy, and since energy cannot be created or destroyed also means that it will also be the total energy at the beginning and the end of the ride since at the moment the car is not moving so there is no kinetic energy. 4. Then as the car moves potential energy transfers to kinetic energy since it is now moving but will still have the same amount of total energy because none of the energy will go away. 5. Potential energy and kinetic energy change throughout the whole ride, at the initial drop there is only stored energy or PE so there will be no Kinetic energy at the start. 6. Then as the car goes in motion there will be less stored energy and more energy of motion so potential energy will transfer to kinetic energy and so the PE will decrease and the KE will increase. 7. I think the hill should be 2 meters because it will have the most kinetic energy to keep it going, there will be 1462J of kinetic energy which is more than all of the other trials. 8. When the drop height is 5 meters that will give you the most potential energy which also will then transfer into more kinetic energy as it moves, but if you add a hill the PE and KE will change a little bit more throughout the ride. 9. If you want a rollercoaster to be fun and exciting usually you add hills and loops and you need as much potential energy and kinetic energy as you can get. 10. 2 meters will give you 1462J of kinetic energy at the top of the hill which will give you enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill and add more hills and loops to make the rollercoaster more fun. 11. I also think the mass of the car should be 60 kilograms because it gives 2936J of potential energy at the top and 2930J of kinetic energy as it is in motion.The masses that are less than 60kg all had less potential and kinetic energy so they wouldn't make it as far as the 60kg car and when you add loops and hills you need as much kinetic energy as you can get so that the car will make it to the end. 12. The more mass there is the more potential energy you start off with to get more kinetic energy as it moves. 13. Height and speed have a direct relationship, and so the higher the drop the higher the speed.
