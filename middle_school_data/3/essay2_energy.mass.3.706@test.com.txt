1. The initial drop height should be 3.5m.2. When I put my initial drop height as 3.5 I found that the PE ( energy that is stored) was greater and it was 1711J.3. At the bottom, I saw that the KE( energy that is in motion) was almost the same as the Ke and the top.4. The amount of energy was keeping the roller coaster going.5. When I made the height 2m I saw that the Pe was only 1,134J.6. At the bottom, the KE was 1700.7. This drop height would be enough to go over more hills and go as fast.8. The relationship between PE and KE is direct.9. When the PE at the top of the hill is going down it is transferred into the Ke causing one to go up and the other to go down.10. The relationship between TE and PE and KE is always direct.11. When the PE at the top goes up the TE ( the total amount of the Pe and KE added together) also goes up.12. Same at the bottom the KE and the bottom goes up so does the TE.13. The changes in the PE and KE get transferred.14. For example When I set the hill height at 4m and the initial; drop at 5m. Pe at the top of the hill was not the same as it was at the bottom.15. The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2448J and the Pe at the top of the hill was 1922J.16. The energy gets transferred when the car is moving and not moving.17. The law of conservation states that energy can not be created or destroyed.18. During the MAss and energy experiment, I saw that when I put the car mass at 50kg I saw that the Pe at the initial drop was 2446J but the Ke and the bottom of the drop were 2430J.19. Those numbers should be the same so why weren't they? The energy was transferred into sound energy, heat energy.20. Thi si called friction.21. The car mass should be 40kg.22. This can cause the roller coaster to have more energy and get over more hills because e the mass is lighter.23. The relationship between the drop height and hill height is very different.24. When we put the initial drop at 5m and the hill height and five found that the cart didn't make it over.25. The total energy would make it go.26. This is why the Initial drop should be 3.5m and the first hill should be 3.26m.27. Because the car to go over and be able to have more energy in Ke to go over more hills.28. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is different depending on the mass.29. When I out of the car mass at 50kg I saw that the PE was 2446 and the KE was 2430.30. The energy transfer.31. The relationship between these is inverse.32. One goes up the other goes up.33. PE and KE at the bottom are related because they show how the roller coaster isn't moving anymore.34. If the kinetic energy at the bottom is higher then the PE is going to be lower.35. This is because the roller coaster has no more potential or energy stored to get it moving again.36. It is at rest.37. The KE will have the majority of the energy.38. However, Heat energy and sound energy( all called friction) will also have some energy.39. Finally mass affects PE as well as KE.40. The more Mass a roller coaster has the more energy it will have scored at the top which is PE.41. For example in Mass and energy on trial, the car mass was 60kg and the PE at the top was 2,936J.42. In the trial of the car which had 40kg, the PE was 1957J.43. KE and mass have a direct relationship.44. At the bottom of the drop, the KE went up when the mass went up.45. In the same example as the car mass of 60kg, the KE was higher than the car mass of 40kg.46. The initial drop height should be 3.5 m.47. Then there should be a hill at the height of 3.36 m.48. This is just enough to allow the cart to go over.49. After that, the loop should be 2.5m Just enough to get the cart over and still be able to go fast.50. When I did this simulation the max speed was 8.27 m/s.51. The most the cart should go is 8.4 m/s.52. This is allowing the car to go fast without being harmful to passengers.53. FInally mass doesn't affect the speed.54. When you plug in both the PE equation in the KE equation both of the masses cancel out.55. This is saying that the higher the mass doesn't affect the speed.
