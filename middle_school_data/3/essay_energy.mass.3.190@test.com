1. If height changes then PE at the top of the hill and KE at the bottom of the hill will change because the higher the ground you are the more PE you will have and depending on if there is friction or not there will be the same amount of KE as well. 2. The total energy is PE and KE added together if there is fiction but if there is no friction it is just the consistent number at the top or bottom of the run. 3. The PE and KE will evenly change so %50 down the run the PE and KE will be the same and at the end, the KE will be greater and at the top, the PE will be greater. 4. Energy can neither be created or destroyed. 5. drop height and hill height are the same. 6. The more mass an object has the more PE it will have at the top of the drop and the more total energy it will have there for the more KE at the end of the drop.
