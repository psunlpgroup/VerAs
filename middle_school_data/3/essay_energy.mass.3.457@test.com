1. I believe the initial drop height should be 5 meters. 2. The PE at the beginning at 5 meters was 2443 Joules and the KE at the bottom of the roller coaster was 2443 Joules. 3. This is going to create enough speed/velocity to get us over our hills, loops, and to the end of the roller coaster since it has the most energy. 4. The relationship between PE and KE is inversely related. 5. When one of the energies goes up, the other goes down. 6. For example: At the initial drop of 5 meters, the PE was 2443 Joules because of the height and mass but there were 0 Joules of KE because the car had no speed/velocity. 7. When the roller coaster car started to go down the hill, the KE increased because it started to gain speed as the PE decreased because the roller coaster car was losing height. 8. The mass also affected the energy. 9. For example: When the height was 5 meters and the mass of the car was 40 kg, the PE, KE, and total energy throughout the ride was 1957 Joules. 10. But when the mass of the car was 60 kg, the PE, Ke, and total energy was 2936 Joules. 11. This shows us that the relationship between Mass and PE, KE, and total energy are directly related. 12. When one goes up, so does the other. 13. The relationship between the initial drop height and the hill height shows us that when the hill height is the same as the initial drop, the roller coaster car will not make it to the end of the ride.
