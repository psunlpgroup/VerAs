Roller coasters are complicated and the Science behind them is even more complicated. In my research I've concluded that my current design The G Overloader is the perfect design for maximum excitement and still being able to function. The reason my design functions is because it has a very initial drop that will carry it through the rest of the ride. With this design it has many loops which in a way gives it more potential energy for the next loop, they even get smaller to make sure that you can go on the next loop despite the loss of energy due to friction. The massive drop height give the car a lot of potential energy to go through the entire ride so through the ride the energy can transfer between potential energy and kinetic energy. As the ride starts the amount of potential energy we have transfers to kinetic energy and the kinetic energy transfers into heat energy because of friction. Height and mass work in similar ways like when you have a higher mass or height you get more energy and less height or mass less energy. For example when my mass was kilograms the total energy was joules and when the mass was kilograms the total energy was joules of energy. It was very similar when we changed height. When the height was the total energy was joules and when the height of the drop was the total energy was joules. With this information I carefully constructed this Roller Coaster. The G Overloader will make customers fully satisfied and will definitely want to come back to ride it again.
