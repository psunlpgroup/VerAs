1. The initial drop height should be 5 m because there will be more energy that will allow the cart to make it to the end of the roller coaster.2. Potential energy is the energy held by an object because of its position and kinetic energy is energy that possesses due to its motion.3. When I was doing the initial drop trials I first had the height at 5 m, the potential energy at the top was 2443 J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J.4. When I had the drop height at 3 m the potential energy at the top was 1466 J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1465 J.5. This shows that the higher the height is the more potential energy it has at the start and the more kinetic energy it has at the bottom of the roller coaster.6. The law of conservation of energy says that energy can be transferred but not created nor destroyed.7. Potential energy and kinetic energy transform back and forth into each other throughout the roller coaster.8. In my initial drop trial, the potential energy at the top of the drop at 4 m was 1955 J, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop was 1954 J, and the total energy was 1955 J.9. This shows that the potential energy transformed into kinetic energy throughout the roller coaster, and the total energy stayed the same.10. When the cart is going down the initial drop some of the potential energy starts changing into kinetic energy.11. During my add a hill trial where I had the hill height at 3, the PE at the top of the hill was 1472 J and the KE was 975 J.12. This shows that the potential energy had started changing into kinetic energy when it went down the initial drop.13. The hill height should be between 2-4 m because the hill height needs to be smaller than the initial drop height so the cart will be able to make it to the end.14. And, the mass of the cart should be 55 kg so it will have more PE and KE.15. When I had the mass at 50 kg the potential energy was 2446 J at the top of the drop and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J.16. This shows that the higher the mass is the more kinetic energy and potential energy there will be.17. The height of the initial drop should be 3.50 m so that the speed is below 8.4 m/s.18. Mass does not affect speed.19. For the mass & speed trial, I first put the cart at 40 kg and the max speed was 8.26.20. Next, I put the mass of the cart at 50 kg, where the max speed was also 8.26.21. This means mass does not affect the speed in a frictionless environment.22. At the beginning of the roller coaster there is only potential energy, then as the ride goes on it transfers into kinetic energy, then potential, then kinetic, until the ride stops.23. This is only in a frictionless environment.24. When there is friction potential and kinetic energy don't just switch back and forth.25. They change into other types of energy like sound or thermal.26. This is because the law of conservation of energy says that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred.
