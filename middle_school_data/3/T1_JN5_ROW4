I would recommend a ride that will safely make it to the end of the ride, has bigger drops than hills, because of the following. The height of the initial drop relates to the potential energy at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom because the higher the drop the more the potential energy and kinetic energy are going to be. For example, when the drop height was . the potential energy at the start was and the kinetic energy at the bottom was Jules. And when the drop was . the potential energy at the start was and the kinetic energy at the bottom was . The relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy is that potential energy kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to the total energy which is the same as the potential energy at the start because no energy can be lost or gained. The change in potential energy and kinetic energy going down the hill is that at the top of the hill there is still more potential energy than kinetic energy but as it goes down the hill the potential energy turns into kinetic energy so there is now more kinetic energy than the potential energy going down the hill. The law of conservation is that no energy can be lost or gained so because no energy can be lost or gained the energy transfers from potential energy to kinetic energy or kinetic energy to potential instead of disappearing it turns into a different type of energy. If the drop height is lower than the hill then the car will not make it up the hill without being pulled up. And the more mass the car has the more energy it will have. For example, when the mass was the total energy was , and when the mass was the total energy was showing that the more mass you have the more energy you will have. When we increased the initial drop height we saw a greater speed at the end of the ride.
