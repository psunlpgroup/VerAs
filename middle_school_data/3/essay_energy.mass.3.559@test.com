1. So if I start my initial drop height at 3m the PE at the top will be 1700J and KE at 0J but if I increase the height of the initial drop height to 5m the PE will increase to 2834J and KE will stay the same, 0J. 2. The KE at the bottom of the initial height with the initial height was 3m the KE at the bottom would be 1700J and so if the initial drop was at 5m the KE at the bottom would then also increase to 2833. 3. So the higher the initial drop is the higher the PE is at the top and the higher the KE is at the bottom of the initial drop. 4. Let's say the initial drop is 5m, you would have a 2834J of PE at the top and by the time you get to the bottom you would have the same amount of energy but it would all change to KE and so the KE went from 0J to 2834J because energy can't be created or destroyed so by the end of the ride the total energy will be the same amount you started with just all KE and not PE anymore. 5. When you're at the top of the initial drop all the energy is PE and the higher you are the more PE you have, and the closer you are to the ground the more KE you have and the less PE you have. 6. When at the top of the initial drop all the energy will be PE and so when you're going down the hill that PE will start transferring into KE until you get all the way to the bottom, all the PE will be gone and it will all be KE, but the total amount of energy will still be the same amount that you started with. 7. When there is more mass in the cart the more energy you will have because you will need more energy to even start to move on the roller coaster. 8. You will have both more PE and KE and you would need more energy to get over the hill because if you had more mass but the same amount of energy you had before you would not make it over the hill after the initial drop. 9. I know this because of the relationship of height and energy, it is direct when one goes up so does the other. 10. however, the mass of the roller coaster car doesn't affect the speed.
