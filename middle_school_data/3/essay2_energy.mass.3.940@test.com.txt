1. The initial drop height should be 3 meters because we want to try to maximize potential energy but we also want the ride to be fun, safe, and enjoyable.2. The height of your initial height will relate to potential energy (which is stored energy that has not been released yet) and kinetic energy (which is energy an object has because of its motion.) 3. The initial drop relates to potential energy because the higher your drop height is the more potential energy you will get out.4. For example, when I started off with an initial drop height of 2 meters the potential energy at the top was 1,173 joules vs when I did a drop height of 4 meters the potential energy at the top was 2,346 joules.5. For all of my trial runs I had 0 joules of kinetic energy at the top.6. As the rollercoaster went down, the potential energy also went down and the kinetic energy went up.7. This is because potential and kinetic energy have an indirect relationship.8. The potential energy at the top equals the total energy and the kinetic energy at the bottom equals the total energy.9. When the car moves downhill, the kinetic energy is increasing.10. When the car moves uphill, the kinetic energy is decreasing.11. The Law of Conservation of Energy states energy cannot be created or destroyed.12. For example, if I started off at the top of the rollercoaster with 100 joules of potential energy, halfway down the rollercoaster I would have 50 joules of potential energy and 50 joules of kinetic energy.13. When the rollercoaster would reach the end then, I would have 0 joules of potential energy and 100 joules of kinetic energy.14. No energy was being created or destroyed, the energy just transferred into a different form because energy transfers.15. This all affects my design decisions because I realized that energy is never going to be gone, its just going to transfer into potential energy or kinetic energy.16. The hill height should be 2 meters.17. It should be smaller than the initial drop height because it won't produce as much energy as your initial drop but it will produce enough to make it fun.18. For example, when I did a hill height of 3 meters there was 2,931 joules of potential energy at the initial drop.19. When the car got to the top of the hill the potential energy was just 1,767 joules.20. And it made it to the end.21. This data shows the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was doubled the amount of energy at the top of the hill.22. The mass should be 30 kg.23. The more mass you have, the more energy you will have too.24. My car mass 40 kg and my total energy released was 1,957 joules of total energy.25. Then, I changed my car mass to 60 kg and my total energy released was 2,446 joules, but mass does not affect speed.26. So I could have any size car mass and still have the same speed.27. For example, I started off with a 40 kg car and the total speed at the end of the ride, was 9.88 m/s.28. Then, I did a 60 kg car and the total speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s too.
