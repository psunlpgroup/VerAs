Dear Gonzales family, If you want a rollercoaster that is really fast and safe I can help you. First, we have to think about how high the initial drop is. I think think that the initial drop should be meters tall because the higher the drop the more potential energy you will have. Potential energy and drop in height have a direct relationship. This means that when you make the hill higher you will have more potential energy. The same goes for the mass of the car. If you make the cart really heavy then the total energy will be more and the potential energy at the top of the hill will be high but not higher than the total energy. the kinetic energy at the bottom will be the same as the total energy as well. The next thing we have to consider is how tall the hill will be. It can not be higher than the initial drop but we still want it to be fun for the riders. We should make the hill height meters tall this way the passengers will be thrilled and they can make it to the top of the hill without going back down the hill. We also have to consider the friction that we will have to encounter during the ride. Friction has to be accounted for because it transfers our potential and kinetic energy into heat thermal energy so that we lose some of that kinetic energy while we are moving. Some of my data showed me that when I increased the friction to . and the mass of the car to kg the kinetic energy was decreased to J and the thermal energy was increased to J at the top of the hill. when there was no friction the kinetic energy at the top of the hill was J and the thermal energy was J. When the friction was at its max the cart couldn't make it to the top of the hill because some of the kinetic energy was converted into thermal energy. PE stated the same KE and PE............relationship defining K and PE
