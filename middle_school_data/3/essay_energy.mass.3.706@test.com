1. The initial drop height should be 5m. 2. When I put my initial drop height as five I found that the PE was greater and it was 2,839J. 3. At the bottom, I saw that the KE was almost the same as the Ke and the top. 4. The amount of energy was keeping the roller coaster going. 5. When I made the height 2m I saw that the Pe was only 1,134J. 6. T the bottom the KE was 1700. 7. This drop height would be enough to go over more hills and go as fast. 8. The relationship between PE and KE is direct. 9. When the PE at the top of the hill is going down it is transferred into the Ke causing one to go up and the other to go down. 10. The relationship between TE and PE and KE is always direct. 11. When the PE at the top goes up the TE also goes up. 12. Same at the bottom the KE and the bottom goes up so does the TE. 13. The changes in the PE and KE get transferred. 14. For example When I set the hill height at 4 and the initial; drop at 5. 15. Pe at the top of the hill was not the same as it was at the bottom. 16. The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2448J and the Pe at the top of the hill was 1922J. 17. The energy gets transferred when the car is moving and not moving. 18. The law of conservation states that energy can not be created or destroyed. 19. During the MAss and energy experiment, I saw that when I put the car mass at 50kg I saw that the Pe at the initial drop was 2446J but the Ke and the bottom of the drop were 2430J. 20. Those numbers should be the same so why weren't they? 21. the energy was transferred into sound energy, heat energy. 22. Thi si called friction. 23. The car mass should be 40kg. 24. This can cause the roller coaster to have more energy and get over more hills because e the mass is lighter. 25. The relationship between the drop height and hill height is very different. 26. When we put the initial drop at 5 and the hill height and five found that the cart didn't make it over. 27. The total energy would make it go. 28. This is why the Initial drop should be 5m and the first hill should be 4m. Cause the car to go over and be able to have more energy in Ke to go over more hills. 29. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is different depending on the mass. 30. When I out of the car mass at 50 I saw that the PE was 2446 and the KE was 2430. 31. The energy transfer. 32. The relationship between these is inverse. 33. One goes up the other goes up.
