I think that the initial drop height should be m because the higher your drop the more potential energy in the rollercoaster there is a direct relationship between potential energy and the height of the initial drop because the formula for potential energy has the equation mass time hight times gravity that saying the bigger drop the more energy there will be and the more potential energy in the rollercoaster the more energy in the hole roller because energy can't be created or destroyed that saying that there will be more kinetic energy at the bottom because potential energy and kinetic energy have a direct relationship along with total energy if it can't be created or destroyed so if the higher the drop the more potential energy how is there more kinetic energy well the potential energy turns into kinetic energy once it starts moving are data also shows this because on the drop of two meters there was potential energy tat the top and kinetic energy at the bottom the same shows when we dropped the cart at meaters there was more potential energy and there was more kenetic energy at the bottom that saying that the potential energy turns into kenetic energy becasue no energy can be created or destroyed only changed. We also learned in our experiment that no hill can be higher than the initial drop height, or require more energy to climb the hill. When a coster cart encounters a hill the kinetic energy starts to turn into potential, so if all your kinetic or moving energy turns into potential resting energy all of your kinetic energy turns into potential then the cart will stop climbing the hill going up the hill. If the cart can't go over the hill then the roller coaster won't make it to the end. I think that the mass in the cart should be because mass and potential energy have a direct relationship so the more mass the more potential energy. The more potential energy the more kinetic because potential and kinetic energy has a direct relationship we can prove this by using our data when we dropped the car at kg it had total energy of and when we cropped the car with kg we had total energy so the more total energy the more kinetic energy the faster the rollercoaster goes
