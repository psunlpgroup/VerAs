Dear Gonzales family, your roller coaster is in great progress. So far, we've learned that the initial drop height should be as high as possible- the more energy, the better. We decided on an initial drop of 4.5m, because it allows enough energy for the cart while keeping the ride exciting. As for the hill after the drop, we plan on making the height as high as possible. According to our data, a hill height of 4m is the perfect combination of safety & fun. We've just completed testing on the car mass. A heavier car will create more energy. Keep in mind, the final design may vary from these plans after more trials & testing. 

That's all for the updates, but we want to bring up a few key points. First of all, to make the ride exciting, as I mentioned before, we need as much total energy as possible. At the top of the initial drop, there is only potential energy, and no kinetic. At any point in the ride, the potential & kinetic energy should always equal the total energy, thanks to the law of Conservation of Energy. This supports the idea that the initial drop height should be as high as possible. For both the initial drop & hill, the greater the height, the more energy. Once the car starts moving, the kinetic energy goes up and potential energy goes down. For example, in our first trial we used an initial drop height of 3m, this gave us 1466J of energy to work with. But when we used 4.5m for the drop, the total energy went up to 2199J. This proves that the greater height, the more energy. This is true for every trial. Additionally, the greater mass, the more energy. For example, when we tested a car mass of 50kg, the total energy was 2201J. When we went up to 60kg, the total energy also went up to 2641J. Finally, when the car is moving down the drop or down the hill, KE goes up and PE goes down. That's it for now! Let us know if you have any changes or recommendations.
