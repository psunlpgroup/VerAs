To have a fun and safe roller coaster, the roller coaster's initial drop should be 5m because you want to have the most PE possible. By going down the initial drop there is more PE turning into KE.PE is the amount of energy you will have going down the drop this should be the same as the total energy, KE is the speed you have at the bottom at the initial drop.f it is less like if it is 2m because you want as much energy as you can get from the initial drop to make it more exciting and so you can have a higher hill height. 
 
The hill should not be bigger than 5m the height of the initial drop, this is because energy can't be created or destroyed so the hill height should be at least 4m tall. If the hill height is 5m and the initial drop height is also 5m you won't have enough energy to make it over the hill so it has to be less than the initial drop.

The total energy is the same amount of PE at the initial drop and PE and KE equals TE. To make sure that the ride is safe you got to make sure you have enough KE to make it over the hill. The total energy is the total amount of PE and KE energy you have, it also is the amount of energy you will have for the whole ride and energy can't be added or destroyed. 

The mass of the car should be 60kg to get the most energy, this is because the more mass the is the faster the car will move down the initial drop and over the hill. The greater the mass The more PE you have at the initial drop and the total energy.
