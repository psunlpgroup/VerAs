To have a fun and safe roller coaster, the roller coaster's initial drop should be 5m because you want to have the most PE possible. By going down the initial drop there is more PE turning into KE.
The hill should not be bigger than 5m the height of the initial drop, this is because energy can't be created or destroyed so the hill height should be at least 4m tall. 
The total energy is the same amount of PE at the initial drop and PE+KE-=TE. To make sure that the ride is safe you got to make sure you have enough KE to make it over the hill.
The mass of the car should be 60kg to get the most energy, this is because the more mass the is the faster the car will move down the initial drop and over the hill.
