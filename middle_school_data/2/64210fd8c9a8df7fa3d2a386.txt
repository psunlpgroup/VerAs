The drop height of my roller coaster is 250 meters. This is because height and potential energy are directly related. That means as we increased the height of our simulation, the amount of potential energy at the top of the drop increased. Which overall affected the amount of total energy within the car. So at the bottom of the drop, there was enough kinetic energy to get the car over our hill. The total energy of the car was whatever the potential energy was at the top of the drop. (This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy) As we went down the drop in our simulation, the potential energy decreased and the kinetic energy increased. Which means they are inversely related. The higher the car is off the ground, the more potential energy it has. One thing we noticed as a group was that the drop height had to be greater than the hill height. That is because the car didn't have enough potential energy to get itself over that hill when they were the same height. Overall, the mass affected the amount of total energy we had. For example, when we simulated having the car mass be our independent variable, the total energy of the car increased as we increased the mass. 
THIS WAS DONE IN A FRICTIONLESS SIMULATION
