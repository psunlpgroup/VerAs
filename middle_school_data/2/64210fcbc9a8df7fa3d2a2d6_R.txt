The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because you can get the maximum amount of energy from that height, so you will have more speed and velocity. The higher the initial drop the more PE it has at the top of initial drop, but it doesn't affect the KE at top of initial drop and that stays at 0. If you have a higher initial drop the KE will increase the more meters you have on initial drop. The more PE you have, the less KE you have when it is at the bottom of the initial drop. Total energy is always the same as the PE at top of initial drop. For example, when PE at top of drop was 1759J, if you look across it shows that the total energy was also 1759J. Going down the initial drop, PE and KE transfer energy and once you get to the bottom of the drop most or all of the PE has transferred into KE. When the KE and PE dont add up to the same thing as total energy, it doesn't mean that the energy just dissappear, but rather it changed into a unuseful energy such as thermal. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Between the drop height and hill height, the PE and KE are split at the top of the hill, but at the top of initial drop the PE is a higher number and KE is always 0 because it isnt moving. The more mass a car has, the more PE it has at top of initial drop and KE at bottom of drop. For example, 50kg at car mass, means it would be about 2446 at initial drop. If the car mass was 60 then the PE would be about 2936, which shows that the more mass a car has the more PE and KE it has. The relationship between PE and KE is direct because as one changes so does the other.
