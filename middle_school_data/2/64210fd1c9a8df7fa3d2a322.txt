The drop height of my roller coaster will be 5 meters high. This is because when my drop height is taller than my hills and loops, the car will make it to the end of the ride. 
I noticed with my trials, the higher the height the more PE, KE and TE. For example, the PE at the top of a 2 meters drop height is 977 J while the PE at the top of a 4 meter drop is 1955 J. Next, the TE and PE at the top of the Initial drop will be the same. This is because PE is stored in an object. For example, the TE and PE at a 3 meter release height were both 1466 J. Next, while the car is moving down the drop, the PE will transform into KE. This is because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. For example, at a 4 m release height the PE was 1955 J of energy and while the car went down the drop the PE turned into KE so the KE was now 2442 J of energy. The 1 J of energy went into the air. Lastly, the more mass you have the Less PE, KE and TE you will have. This is because, the more mass you have the slower your car will go. For example, with a car mass of 60 kg the PE was 2444 J but with a 40 kg car the PE was 2446. These simulations were all tested with no friction.
