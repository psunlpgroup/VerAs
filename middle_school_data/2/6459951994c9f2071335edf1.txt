Dear Gonzales family
  So with this roller coaster you are trying to build.For us to build this roller coaster we need some safety requirements.Some of these will be or initial drop height or hill height even the weight of our car these will make the energy change and be bigger and smaller. 

First we will talk about or roller coasters initial drop and hill height.For our heights we will have to make our initial drop height taller than our hill height. The reason for this is because with the first drop we need to create a amount of energy to get over the hill so if our hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop or car will not get over. Here is some evidence we did some tests we keep or initial drop height at 5.00 meters.So we put or hill height at 4.01 meters and it created 2448 Joules of energy and made it over the hill.But when we put the hill height at 5.00 meters it created more energy that was 2449 joules of energy and it didn't make it over the hill. So this shows that our hill height needs to be smaller than the initial drop height.

We do need some things that might help our roller coaster to be fun. We might want our initial drop height to be pretty tall it would create lots of Potential energy at the top of the drop and it will turn into ken-tic energy at the bottom. While this energy transfers between kinetic and potinel because we cant destroy or create energy can only transfer it that is what the law of conversation of energy says. This will create more energy for this coaster to be more fun and have  more inversions. Also if our car weighs more it will create more energy and will help that too we did some experiences to show that the car will create more energy if it weighs more. When the car weighed 40kg it created 1956 joules of energy while the car that weighed 60kg created 2934 joules of energy.
