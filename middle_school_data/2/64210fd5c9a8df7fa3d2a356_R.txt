when making your roller coaster you should make the drop height 5 meters, the hill height 3 meters, and the mass of the cart 50kg

first you should make the drop 5 meters because of the relationship between height and energy. the relationship between height and energy is directer so when one goes up the other goes up to. by making it so the height is high you make it so the energy is high too. for example when getting data at the top of the drop with the height of 2 meter the PE was at 977 joules of energy at the top, with the KE of 0 joules. the drop with the height of 5 meters at the top had a PE of 2442 joules of energy at the top. with the KE of 0 joules. at the bottom its the same the energy just converts to the opposite. or into other types of energy like sound and or heat. in the simulation i used had no friction so there was no heat or sound energy. that's why when  the cart got to the bottom the ke was 977 joules for the first trial and 2442 joules for the second. both with a pe of 0 joules. on earth that's not possible so that's why you want to make the hill smaller then the drop so that with the friction it can still go over the hill. the TE can never change it will always stay the same because of the law of conservation of energy. so starting with a higher amount of energy means you'll end with that energy. 

by making the cart 50kg the cart will make it so you can have more energy, then if you have a lower amount of mass this will make it so there is less energy. but if you have more mass then there is more friction so it might not ride as smooth. for example in the simulation i use i did three trials the cart mass was 40, 50, and 60kg. the trial with 40kg had 1955 joules of TE. the 50kg had 2443. the 60kg had 2932 joules. by making it so its 50kg you get the benefit of more energy but don't have to worry as much on the friction.
