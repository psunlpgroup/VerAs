The height of the drop should be 5 m. this will give the most pe to make it to the end of the ride. The pe of the 5 m drop was 2443J but when I decreased the height to 4 m the pe was 1955J, the pe, ke, and total energy will always be the same as long as the ride ends on the ground. When the drop height was 5m the 2443 and a ke of 2442 at the bottom of the hill, when the drop height was 3 m the pe was 1466 and the ke was 1465. The hill should be 3m tall, with the 5m drop the 3m hill the car will make it over the hill. When the hill height was 3m the car made it over the hill but when the height was increased to 5m the car could not make it over the hill. The mass of the car should be 60kg. The pe for a 60kg car will be 2933J but when I decreased the mass to 50kg the pe was only 2444. The greater the mass the more pe and ke the car will have. When the mass is 60kg the pe was 2933J and had a ke of 2932J of ke, but when the mass was 40kg the pe was 1955 and had a ke of 1955.
