Dear Gonzales family, 

I believe it's in your best interest for your initial drop height to be higher than your first hill. The roller coaster will not have enough potential energy to make It over the hill if it is higher than the initial drop height. The higher the PE at the top of the initial drop, the higher the KE at the bottom. The higher the KE at the bottom, the better. Because if you want a new and exciting ride, you're going to need a high drop height. The reason for this is that energy cannot be created, so if your drop height is low, the ride isn't going to have enough PE and KE through for it to be exciting. 

I also recommend a heavy cart. My reasoning for this. Is that the cart will go faster down the hill, resulting in a higher speed and more excitement for the riders. 

I hope you will consider my advice. Best wishes, Lin.
